I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me with it.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
Or learn to feel, think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lumbi Street, in Indonesia, 30 meters below the water, with that feeling of ungravit√©s, surrounded by a huge biodiversity, of turtles, of mold fish, of all colors.
I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature, it was a very mystical and spiritual experience.
And then, at that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Do you fail?
And black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was an intense spiritual feeling, and you're thinking, "This teacher is crazy, spoke with fish," it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
He works 24 hours for a week.
To draw that piece of art we're going to see.
Or, on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that mandala that we see proves that nature has awareness and that I diploma.
And if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena? I think yes?
And, in fact, I bring you more scientific proof, last year Science journal published a study where they analyzed 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems.
Well, scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between pregnant and predators, that is, in four legs there were three lions, or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern, reproduces our inner, in our organic physiology.
(Laughter) According to Claiver's law, an elephant that has a size thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse, but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
So I wonder: Is it a simple coincidence the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, really, or nature has an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great history of my doctoral research, that is, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
(Laughter) The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and history of human beings. That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here they give you a summary.
(Applause)
And I remember with scientific consensus, the planet Earth was formed between 4.5 billion years, with the explosion of the Big Times, the universe emerged 13.7 billion years ago.
The first complex cells were originated, the biological variety has increased at a great speed by measuring a wide range of multisellular organisms, inferior, with the cosmic exclusion of methane, biological variety has increased at a speed of this period, and the miracle of life, between 3.5 billion years.
In fact, it is known that the autropitects have about 4 million years, the hegemonic period of mammals started, even though it seems to indicate that the classic period thanks to possible rests found until the year.
(Laughter) Currently, Homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species that cohabits and co-evolves around the planet Earth, pointing to the rest of its rich biodiversity.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago, and especially since the industrial revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed, as something unbearable.
It's a species between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, only one species, one more unitanean, is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy, and all of us are responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs, but the human being keeps trying to destroy everything around him.
In this half of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
(Laughter) It seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, to equate the thermal fusion of the stars, that can reach 65 million integrated degrees, and, if that were little, future generations are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we leave in Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: From 1990 to 2020 we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Do I follow the world's forum of nature?
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles that are given in the US and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming and this means, imagine that we close the doors and windows of this theater.
PK: Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it is true that there is violence and pregnancy and excess of all forms in life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation, I give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not competence, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players together with all the technical body behind them.
But human beings continue to create linear thinking ideologies, our body is a pluricellular organism, where millions of cells cooperate to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered meteorites and linear processes.
Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed communism that failed socialism, that failed as well, that is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren, that is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
Money has colonized life and that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
This is not new, it's already done by indigenous peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years, and I invite you to play a game.
How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us, imagination, what did they think of making a plane?
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
Well, the Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites, we could build bioclimatic buildings.
And with this turning on its own.
A plant of solar panels, as we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature, many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb up a lot by economy centuries every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw material for the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren, I would like her to tell me, "Dad, imagine a future dialogue with her children and grandchildren, at least you tried it, fight."
AD: And you.
And what would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
And what we have to say is that the fourth of our opportunity and the pandemic is not autonomous, it's horrible things, the police will do everything we need, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, well, we extract our friend.
This horrible thing, there's nothing to do with respect, and not about why you think, it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of and we're not leaving something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment, we've done it now.
And what I had to think about entering is an idea in which I was meditating from a book.
And what impressed me was that for him, he was going to take care of a garden, as a person writes, and then decides, it's a lot of movies from some sources of his career, it's the newspapers that have already brought me to the 80s when the HAV diagnosis, spend the time, cooking, making bread or loxima.
Or cleaning and thinking, "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And this reproductive work, the one that put new things in the world, we can say, cook to the workers so that the next day the factory, his care work, and the feminine we've spent a long time now, increasing that reproductive work, which is a job that comes out of machismo, basically, so that we can do that.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject of the original, which produces the new world in which the subject that sees, these are values that we don't think of absolute value, because if workers don't eat or in the factory, they don't make you think, because it's an important person.
Let's think it's the opposite, it even says care tasks, it's the most important: 100 days we are living without advertisers, without writers, without a lot of things, even ears, without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning, but the world doesn't send themselves spinning without food and care.
And without health, the only thing that is allowed us today is to eat and cure and clean.
So these tasks are not a mechanical thing that we have to go above, and without that, the world doesn't act, not only see food, it can think like that, we have thought them for a long time.
This is also an interesting thing. The care relationship with our bodies, we think we have to take care of our bodies, the human being separated, as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that also has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not nature when it turns it into something else.
And that the body is going to do something that has to overlook.
This new opportunity, and in fact, of course, I want to come back to my life, now the world doesn't need more soap operas and I want to write a soap opera, that's life, we all live in this contradiction and this life for the absurd, since the world needs more soap operas, I thought well.
Why not, instead of being obsessed with keep being productive in these days and getting to know all schools and all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in another way, from that?
That's why, in fact, when I was invited to do this passive thing I didn't suggested, that I had nothing to have an intension of an original idea, the world hadn't been so novel and that the world didn't need another idea, but that's why I thought that writing and more I had with my books and that maybe I'd tell other people, what to do, take care of.
Thank you very much.
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat, no bread, the sweetest, no more posters.
Every 15 days, scared, an end of a half.
These foods don't fat, what wakes up is the unmed and disordened form in which we consume them, but today I want to name you three key aspects to have a good food: the first is consciousness.
AC: One time, a teacher told me: "Onstage of secondary awareness to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take secondary awareness to our desires, we would never choose a food we wanted to eat, but on the contrary, the one we liked the most.
And after that, we are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating and what amount.
QD: A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Why?
Because when we are hungry, it's not hungry, it's hungry, it's hunger, and the most caloric.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
B, dream, hug, an escape with double cheese.
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really able to say pizza, nothing funny, I prefer a needle?
Impossible, huh?
Well, the second aspect is practice.
To eat, like every process in life, you learn.
And in this case, and in many cases, my include remains.
We must learn to eat in this station what this means, to eat the food that was costed at that time.
This allows us to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and thus enhance our health.
A: Because foods surrounded by their own times.
They are the most natural food, that is, they are not addressed with calories, they are the richest food in nutrients, or it's normal to see fruit all year, unnecessary for our body, and they are not treated chemically to survive in time, or it's normal to see tomatoes, in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony to eat always the same.
The last aspect?
That for me it's not a small one, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
Those who don't break, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because they often give Ausia.
And I have a question.
Who would you like to repeat the mattress dish with fruits?
To think, right?
So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
Because hunger is not affordable if they stay comed, if they eat.
It's what wasn't consumed during the day, it's going to consume in the afternoon or night, and in double part.
(Laughter) To make it more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
increasingly bigger, increasingly increasingly increasingly stronger.
So, if we don't stop every three or four hours to take a break.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unleash the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the cheaper jokes, I'm going to lose and not.
The most expert body becomes in reserve, in guarding.
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, all we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat, we go out in favor of that ignorance, food can hurt you or can cure you, depends on us, take awareness, what we are feeding us and what amount.
So, I return to the moderation.
Just as there is the phrase that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation.
The same food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure, I propose you to eat rich, eat everything you like, eat variable, but always take care of the portion.
There's no reason the phrase of "Sayuna como rey," "Almourza como prince and dinner as a beggar," I think many of us know it.
health doesn't have excuses: "Oh, I can't, there I don't have one, hunger happened, or worse."
Sometimes I died of breastfeeding.
We have four opportunities every day to choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthy, thank you very much.
A while ago I was obsessed with telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first one that happened obvious to me: Marie Curie, they didn't give them a Nobel Prize, they were given two, so it deserved their pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things.
Eugenia works actively until 2004 did greatorts. among them, the most important thing was that the vaccine brought me against polio in the 50s, thanks to her, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less since 2011 I was 111 years old.
But I found out of them recently.
How I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that this made me find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were, but above all, to not lose ourselves at age.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question and the answer are new in our language, from the beginning of the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography a very simple and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond to one letter, each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, that says we have to write, as we say, it's and it's not at the base of ortography as a cat, so we stay with gestures, that sometimes are aspers as people, and so we stay with feces, feces and feces.
Three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
(Laughter) I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for my own experience: we all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that time of plastic, child, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules, crying, however, exceptions, they broadcast us in many forms and explained the idea that in ortography there was something fundamental for our training.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that complied ortography?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is quite simpler and less transcendental of what you usually believe in, ortography is useful, but then it wouldn't make sense to simplify the current rules so that we all write the same and so it wouldn't be easier to understand ourselves when we read, but in contrast with other issues of language whose complexity, they deserve time and effort.
(Video) What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that everyone writes as they want.
Sign language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental that these common criteria are the simplest thing we can, above all, because if we simplify our orthography we're not leveling downward, when ortography is simplified, it doesn't become the quality of language or to make voices, the gongora I see.
That sometimes they write men, without H. Sometimes they write "scribing with scholarship" and it's absolutely clear to me that the difference between those texts and our ones is of convention or lack of convincement still at the time, but not of quality.
(Laughter) But let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive, a long time ago, that teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is that when things like you are, that makes all the sense, you can manage or stop achieving a job by a H, who put or stopped putting, you can become an object of public mocker once misunderstood, so in that clear context that makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout history of our language, there were always teachers or individuals linked to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reform, sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andr√©s Bello, promoted the highest ortographic reform that had indeed occurred in Spanish language, which was the one in Chile, in the middle.
In the 19th century.
Why not take the bet of those teachers and start?
I'm going to move forward in our ortography here, in the intimacy of us the 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seems reasonable to start discussing.
We chose HMUDA, where we wrote a H.
(Laughter) But we don't say anything, we don't write anything, it's hard to think which kind of sentimental attachment can justify for someone.
All the engines made by HEMUDA, B√©larga and Becuerta, we said, "Never did they distinguish in Spanish language," we chose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one can argue, that we don't with one, let's eliminate the other, "hahitjota" and that the jauta retains the sound "asper√≥."
Jalabe, giraffe, people, Argentinians.
And I know!
Because that, Iceta, is an interesting case.
(Laughter) Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases the pronouncement differences should be taken care of, now I said before, it's published in some places that correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic.
Well, they are not that much.
The Spanish Academy Real, all language gyms, also believe that ortography should be modified, and that sometimes the attachment to history, traditions and customs, turn into an obstacle for today's use.
And that explains, in fact.
I think our language is much more.
It's that those we know, that we have geographically close.
What was historically modified, for example?
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater, to theater, we were of quantity, we were of symbol, of symbol.
And little by little, now they start to get rid of frequently some roads in the dictionary of the Academia Real Academia, flour, harmony, they can write with H or H.
And we're all fine.
It also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously from below to top, which are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications and that the authority in some places a gym, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
So, a long time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the level of words, it's less true for the grammar level, and I almost would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to below.
It was always the institutions that fixed the rules and suggested modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until now, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use than speaking?
But at our time, the time of social media, that is suffering a revolutionary change.
(Laughter) He never wrote as much as now, never so many wrote in the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale dusted ortographic shapes, where even people with impeccable orthography and pereducated people when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication right now.
There are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention to it, because you are probably telling us that once they assign to writing, a new place, they are asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do wrong to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with simplified ortography, we will stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring, in the vast majority of situations, the context disseminates any confusion.
VR: But there's a third objection.
And for me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, which is what they say.
But I don't want to change.
I get hurt like this, I got used to this way when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "The eyes hurt me."
(Video) That objection is part of each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used, and we expect time to feel?
That are the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits.
It's in the prudence the consensus, the level of alism and tolerance, but we can't let the scare to older people prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us, I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest environment, but important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future.
Good afternoon before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris and tell myself: "Don't blame your eyes."
After his death, reality didn't make sense, he had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
(Laughter) The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became a father.
This image.
Well, you see it.
And that's the image of the ashes of my father in a microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this taught me that our most pure material essence is acariciated by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror there is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
Third: And space technology.
And their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
AC: We shouldn't create an INBAP for education.
Imagine a public agency that designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass, develop border research to use, for example, artificial intelligence in education at a large scale.
AC: A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logics, the best specialists should come and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management: the first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
That is to say, not like the variable of all the others.
That's how education changes won't benefit the most advantages.
(Applause) Today, I'm not scientist, and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations, from bigamors, even pandemics.
And here, now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves questions even the most ridiculous and the world's most, for example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior, which seems and ridiculous, has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on the intensity than on the relevance, the answer is a bit like the footballer who runs desperately a ball that actually knows won't happen.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, thinking that it's going to happen to us, made the great politicians of Europe and many other places in the world, while we talk about phone or worse, while we send messages, they lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but they are more moral, and, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stems, for example in bobonic fishing, were adjusted to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in a cemetery of rats, which were those that were really spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the most chairs are useful, especially to avoid people who are already sick contagiate others. However, in Japan, everybody is willing to chew, to know who is sick and who isn't, if they use no more chairs.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the stest and take care of everybody.
Maybe, what we've found the most in our traditions, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we really lack is motivation to do something, in general we think that education couldn't change and that it was of those things that was extremely difficult to change it, and yet, in three days, all children are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
Also, of course, they change our values, our judges, just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to do a small mental experiment, a dilemma, a caricature so we can think about the future?
Imagine the next situation.
Imagine that with this, we really highlight the effect of epidemic, a public discourse that includes the world's health organization, it disappears completely, but there are much less people who stop the economy and the world in the way we see it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that it was a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the principle of the pandemic and could choose if you feel good or bad to do this?
What would you do?
And I chose this dilemma because I think it's a voice to the inevitable attention that there is, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms, as part of a social pact, perhaps and everything.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case with sexual freedom, we find a good solution of commitment.
Sex-compreservative: when all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel freely and care?
Will they fly less too is a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves? Do we think it's good to be part of our tattoo as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want anybody to be the conservative sex of coronavir.
My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old on a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagona and Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with strings full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It was an animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it "freeliers of sea," are partners of the sea wounds, and they were very common in the seas invaded Patagonium 15 million years ago.
At that moment, I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
which are extremely fragile, the sea dollar broke, fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way, but I was interested in fossils, or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating and taking me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is nowadays, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
It's a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like this of 10,000 people: 10,000 for 10,000, those are 100 million, it's a number that doesn't enter your head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to have in our heads.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I've traveled some of them and I've studied fossils from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it has also led me.
to a very special place, Patagone.
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally, we think of these forests, forests, lagos, near the Andes mountains, but for us paleontologists, Patagonia is this, it's a wonderful and full of fossils that are still being discovered.
We know, fortunately 70 million years old, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South Hemisphere, the dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called "Belis√°urios," while for that time, in the northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, what we call the legal period about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of the dinosaurs on our planet, for the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivores of carnivores in all the planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagonia.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking a very hot afternoon.
And after walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw a few meters something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor, and I approached as I approached, it became clearly what it was.
It was the path where it hurt us.
I approached, stood next to me, shooled, I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and the Bellos knew it was, after studying years, bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the trash part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But I couldn't believe it really, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
After warning the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
(Pre-recorded voice) Until the next season the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found, or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day of the expedition, clearly the animal had died at a lake's orchelines and was covered by endless mud layers, preserving in an intact way its complete skeleton of this dinosaur.
And that's where the excavation really begins, to throw away, layer, those sediments that were burning us where it would be, it's a very exciting moment, for the first time it's going back to the surface a animal that lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The cinema had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Afterwards, all that buried rocket had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a warming of this whole block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those hills looking for those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering the judges is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours under the sun, the patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry all these remaining protected by bones tables to the lab, in the lab to the museum, another very long stage is where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, the carnivores of the southern hemisphere, and this discovery showed us that this family had originated about 100 million years before what we thought, much before the south hemisphere and the north hemisphere separated in the USA in a supercontinent supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we really do them in the lab, we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was contained in those role blocks.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange accidents, dents in form of hand, and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very special, besides, because of something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replica of the crash of this dinosaur, is a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or a complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the end of the head at the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur minister didn't look at the forms we contracted or knew from the northern hemisphere, studying its remains, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had already been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times, the Atlantic Ocean was still not formed today to these two continents, but again, we had a case of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the North Hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Returning the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic, that was possibly present in the existence of a certain fact in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was in the south of this huge equatorial desert, it was a great fact what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the fauna of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these vaccines, it wasn't a desert filled with water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs.
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we've really told us fantastic, fascinating organisms, have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life, have diversified and achieved terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this is the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written over 4.5 billion years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages still by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, its keys, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays, it's fundamental to know its history.
Because knowing the past is key to understand the present.
It's also key.
To project a future.
Many of us.
Or when I was a kid I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would read so many books later and they would see so many movies, I dreamed of healing and having magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
Why?
But something of that childhood vocation remained in me, and almost without realizing it, I dedicated myself to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work, losing the subway, are not my imagination, but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers, maybe, which is the superpower to think better.
Obviously there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I believe are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you and that our ability to think is not given nor fixed, but can be developed.
Pooling our mind with powerful and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first: imagine you enter a gym, look at those on the floor, parents of these rings, fixed bikes, turn around.
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
It doesn't work like that, our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same, it doesn't count to think, because it counts to think.
We have to practice thinking, developing in ourselves the habit of thinking, in intelligence isn't something you have or you don't have, it's something you use and do time to think, it's something you use or not.
That's the second one.
It says the saying that the one who only sees a bottle that now the one who only has a bottle sees all the problems as a slave.
But if we have to remove a torn, a hammer is useless.
And not to take into account of his slave.
If we have a torn, we need a disaster, and if we need to cut something, we need a bear.
We have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models, if we only have a mental model, we will think all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 out of 2,000 with a bad human, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do we find these mental models, where we remove them from, mental models, physics, biology, engineering, psychology, and there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
To think better we have to broaden the brand of tools of our head, but all the problems will seem worried to us.
It's the third one.
Not long ago, I was at the club and at the table on the side, a man told his friends for a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told the teacher.
But he didn't realize that...
When I said this, I was causing a much bigger evil.
In his child.
I was leaving him like a bone in front of his friends and he was detegitiming the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that being focused on winning on a scale, we don't have success on that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stages.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example, winning money and losing freedom, or winning freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about the most important scale what we are going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
And the beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the pressions generate emotions and emotions make us act, for example, now in the pandemic, a lot of data came from China's situation.
But those facts didn't generate impression, generated emotions, and they didn't make us act.
When they began to come images of Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those pressions generated emotion, fear, and fear generates action, that we are all stored preventively what is very good.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone like us happened before.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
Casar is something: you're hungry, home, you have an immediate reward, you eat what you married, but you cultivate very different, now makes the effort for something that you'll be able to take within six months or a year.
This is the piling of almost everything we have, preventing us from creating applause, because it is avoiding something no one is delicious, but saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel, that is, develop our ability to anticipate, is one of the main skills of thinking well.
What do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we don't see?
Of whom?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations: if something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted, if we programmed to run 20 to 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience, but the key of resilience is to handle the expectations well.
And the sixth and last.
Some time it happened to you that you met an acquaintance where you are walking through a village in the middle of NASA, a high schoolmate who wasn't going to do 15 years ago, you can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague in that place is something totally unlikely, but, as we know so many people, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same, there are so many unbelievable things that are very likely that something happens to us.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future, we don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times, we have to learn to coexist with uncertainty.
Maybe the intelligent way of coexisting with uncertainty is to always leave many open doors.
Don't think just about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible of serious things, even if they're very likely, and if someone ever asks you, why do you always have the car with the Nasta tank?
It's not that because once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world with a high schoolmate who you wouldn't see 15 years ago.
In other words, the principle I guided the zero of this talk, surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn and learn has to do with being idle.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking and people with whom we cultivate these ideas, empower ourselves from people who enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others, it's about changing our own ideas, an interview Borges 40 years ago, the interview asked me a question, and when Borges replied.
I apologize, he looked at this same question four years ago: Borges kept quiet and said to him, "That you answered to me, I haven't had much time to think about this issue for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limited moment that is to live to be accepted of the new ideas that are emerging and always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
Women are irraational beings always given to emotional disorder, that's why they need the cost of a man, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives.
So, they will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915, no country in the world women could vote, in 2015, that means, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women, in 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here were already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, a woman is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
Well, this was this idea.
Because women are only useful to create children and help their husband, which is an irrational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed in it, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time, and almost all taking 5,000, perhaps, believed that this idea was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived in economic years, if this is true, there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem: now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that it doesn't exist in facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretive frame, which day is September 24?
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we've convinced it's on September 24th, because everything we're here agrees with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the 500 or more calendaries, every thing we say, every thing we think, every step, live without schedule.
My dog appreciates the hot and the one at this moment is alone at home.
S: No, causing some illness.
But I didn't know the time, I knew it, which time had come back.
But he doesn't look at the clock.
Well, if human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world.
What might be, a little more stimulation, but surely the world we would live in wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, he looked at a pity fall, was to write the law of gravity, what a genius, but it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels had passed away, to know the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc., besides...
It doesn't matter how great a man can do, if he has no context, he can't think of an idea, but if he was born, was born in the 19th century, with a new born, as we have seen, discussing the investigations that were accumulated over 500 years, the same happens with the theory of activity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same, this politicians and social, the revolutionary change.
Nevertheless, in less than 100 years, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women. They look at all the creative energy lost by humanity to think how women were not for anything else than to clean pneakers.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can do.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that model to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality, until 1860 there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say: "But how in the Greeks and the Romans, and the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you today, they've always existed in all culture, they're at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human, but they had never thought that sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Vitoriana, who was one of the greatest forms of social control over a century and see the strongest thing that exists, because the same thing that turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do is not temporary.
(Laughter) You'll do it guilty, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to be guilty.
(Laughter) The guilt is a big social control, huh?
(Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man.
(Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, do you do it, right?
And then, this is a terrible social control form because it dominates us, dobly, on one hand, do you know we can't leave it, it's as if we were deprived of eating?
And we can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
And homosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted all over the world, they didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as the previous women, or the Jews or the blacks, which is science-like of slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of sexual friends, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the Jews' situation, in some of the situations today is ideal.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be fusiled, but in many parts of the world today they are completely legal, this was possible, due to the paradigm shift, and why this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gays, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed, assumed their identity, which 20 years ago, to be respected, and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have a full right, who have a full right.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jew, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, complex, contradictory, that maybe I don't want to cost a guy, what do I know, but however, I have to assume that?
(Laughter) Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
50 years ago.
Look how old Sun, I was a homosexual kid, I didn't know what it was to make a homosexual boy, and they didn't even say to me, "My schoolmate told me, "Sure, we're going to hit you."
"Sure, don't look at me."
And I didn't even know what it was to be a cake, a cake, a homosexual, or anything, and at the same time I knew that it was rejection, that was something I had in me, that I didn't know that my father, who loved me, looked at me.
And I was born to feel what I would have done so bad for it to come out like this.
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity that is, it had the positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
Yes, against dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn that I'm also good to someone, to say that I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay at 24 hours, that I have to escape identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea that I had been having, that it comes from understanding that facts don't exist, that exist.
Why?
(Applause)
(Laughter) interpretations.
(Applause) There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it, we're contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to take the assume to stay there to defend myself, and now I want to leave prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
And they told me: "The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, and if it better had the things we need to explore, but exploring is something difficult, terrifying every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement, it leads us to situations that we need to survive, Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to explore.
Every moment is a combination of energy, but once you say it, each one of these ideas seems like a bomb that tries to exterminate, that double the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, or put it aside, and in part with each one of them, to keep going back, running, or running.
(Laughter) But learning to achieve this movement is complicated: learning to damage your own movement, I believe you, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs, and that even if life controls music, the movements you don't stop laughing.
Moments that are kept in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that will probably not be an artwork, but will allow you to revive the exact way in which those stars were seen.
That voice, your best friend, is enough to always go, will be the first to stand up, the first to give yourself a little bit of chance to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it, that person is a better friend.
A microphone, a couple ofaguas, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, if it's not a moviemaker, I can't survive.
DB: What we created in girls cities.
I'm sure that we once chose.
(Laughter) There's no opportunity to get out, there's nothing to do, I can't go on a stable job, I can't make any progress in the way I would like to.
(Laughter) Do you remember that all the time, married, was better?
Is this really the case?
When I think about this, I inevitably remember my friends of the whole life, or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us in these photos that you're seeing there, and Juancho, Ranco and Manuel.
I can tell you about my friends that I really love them, who are like my brothers, who, as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to be able to study what they liked, stayed here in the city and be surprised today, they can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
As for me, as I am the port in this photo, the mark of the absence of opportunities also became present, my folks, who are workers, made an effort on human beings so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew I didn't know if they stayed here in the city...
I could study something, but probably the future as a person was so short of opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
We live in the middle of the 21st century that we are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, in which successes and progress are at a speed that surprise us all and collapse the borders and the barriers that exist between people.
And in this context?
And the cities, to make more and more important tales, we are going to be sincere, they are our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that, in 2050, 68% of the world population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more and more people choose to live in cities it means there are places where we have more chances to progress.
What is it that explains why, while the weapons of cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them?
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that they want them to keep the cow when they leave this door to return to their homes: this one, strategy.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
And it happens around our strengths, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world has to offer us, not in an indiscriminate way, but to connect cities as a professional future in the field of international relationships, with the opportunities that the world can have are our most vulnerable features.
Through concrete projects, now have a look at all this, this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life, and avoid migration towards other places searching for a better future.
Once again, inevitably, I remember them, my friends.
Secondly, as well as saying it's given a kind of investment relationship, it's about what it is, we add a fifth friend, the group hits, and so evites, they can notice a couple of things, but, secondly, as they improve the quality of the photos of the phones.
Franco, for example, who is also the one of them in this photo.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2002, national champion.
(Laughter) But today, even if you want to detect a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday students working, simply to be able to live.
Because I like going to the subway, I wanted to study something related to the field of passion, after the fingerprint is the one on my left, and I can't even get a job that allows a certain economic independence.
(Laughter) Every day working in his place that built from nothing itself goes to university to study programming and cannot develop his potentials and continue learning what they like, because it doesn't count all the necessary tools for the lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you, absolutely nothing, is that we, as young, have nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world.
Do you know?
(Laughter) As soon as I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 young worldwideedes, I left Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian that event to participate in a week in New Delhi, the capital of India.
Great!
The thing is to say it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot, but if there are two things I'd like to share with you, they are accidents.
In summary, there are millions that have a state present to come out to the world and bring them opportunities to them, but not less important, but do you know what makes them different that we don't have, we don't have to forget about young people, nor the children, nor anyone, for all tastes and colors?
(Laughter) Once again we want better cities, we know the world strategically.
When I arrived at Rosario for the first time, I found myself to go to study, I remember, it was less unexpected, with a lot of fear.
This can never be said in public because it's very difficult, but all those around me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city, your home, it's like leaving a piece of your heart, until today I feel it like this, almost six years went by.
So that this doesn't happen to you, to your friends, or anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
After all, what's most beautiful to be allies to the city that had made you?
And with a strategy we can do.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco.
(Laughter) If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or how much if today they were in one of the safety forces of our country?
Or to not go so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to keep adding what he likes.
That's it?
This is how we see the lack of opportunity.
Of course, all this.
And I'm telling you that it doesn't look like enough argument and you want another example.
Look!
(Laughter) Very good.
This is the tattoo that tells me, when finally I was able to overcome the unique depression in which I fell because I had to go to the edition.
After two intentions of suicide.
In numeral, psychological sequences that took me a long time to overcome.
If we want these things to stop happening, we have to go out strategically.
Please, we don't eat a final point in our city.
AC: Thank you very much.
I'm a surgeon.
Well, since always the surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in the last 10 years.
It was my research.
(Laughter) In my case, in the sofa, it was based on looking for the reasons to operate less and less patients.
And that can be done in many ways, we do that, for example, by looking for genes to detect diseases sooner like cancer, and so we don't have to operate them.
We can help the tissues to repair themselves by themselves, using their own capacity to regenerate, which are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own ability to restore themselves after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
KA: Robotics is giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks.
(Laughter) What seemed like science fiction previously, today is almost everyday, it's amazing.
Undoing my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction, me and a lot of patients that prevented having to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work.
I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor, my mother is Japanese, literary, sociological, and anthropological of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and social answers and individuals of the Japanese society can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's about making us a first question.
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium if it was in January the first case?
Tening almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space, being so close to China.
Moving from the population of the third age in the world.
Sing in the second country with more smokers per number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
And the identified one, but a linear progress up until now.
Basically, we know that this new virus runs a virus is very contagious, a lot of people, in little place, and a fourth of these people, in these demographic data, so Japan shows us a cocktail that allows us to spread the disease with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in a way that responds organically and united to any event that compromises it.
Jap√≥n went through wars, Tifions, her name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 earthquakes per day.
Generation, after generation, has had to overlleve natural disasters cogenerated by humans.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained, who has no infrastructure, who has to go out to improvise.
The directives of social distancing and hygiene and individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or in its own home.
The Japanese population hasn't established hundreds of years ago, you don't need to say no to embrace yourself, not to give them bees, because they don't do it.
And she greets with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most of the workers in public spaces use singers.
In fact, years ago, studies show that more than 50 percent of Japanese don't need to recommend to get out of shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary, you don't have to indicate you don't want to stamp or possess on someone else, you'll use trouble when you feel cold.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good of all is more important than the good of a part.
(Video ends) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience two Western teachers did in a Japanese school.
I mean, you'll surely know the game of the chair.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get one out of each round.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, kept all following the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves this way of being, it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
In the example there are children, but we can already see how a collective society works, they help themselves, because each e-mailism contributes to the good of everyone.
