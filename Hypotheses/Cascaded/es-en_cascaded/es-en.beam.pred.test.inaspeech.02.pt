(Laughter) I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
And I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
We need to learn to feel.
Think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water, with that feeling of pregnancy, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, turtles, molamous fish.
And from fish from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
A: At that time, I observed as a little bird.
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling, and it makes what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, talks to fish, right?
And it's the same thing my students think at university, every time I tell you about it, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
And...
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
QD: I work 24 hours for a week.
To draw that work of art that we're going to see and that I'm not crazy, or on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that mandala that we see proves that nature has awareness and if I am able to talk to fish.
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants?
With rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
And in fact, I bring you more scientific proves.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
And scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
(Sigh) Okay with the Cliver's law?
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
The planet we live in.
It is composed of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
Or nature really has an inherent consciousness.
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development and here they bring you a summary.
And I remember with scientific consensus, the explosion of the dictator, the universe emerged 3700 million years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4 billion years ago, for example, the chain, the forms of primogenite life on Earth, were maintained in levels of complexity, very simple, with the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere.
Thanks to fossil remains found up until the date, Homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species, Cocoa Tis, 200,000 years ago, the hegemonic period began, that domesticated animals and plants over 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a significant way, like something unsustainable.
Specially between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species?
A single species, an itan more, is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
While it seems that we have forgotten of irosymics and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees integrated.
And why if that was little?
The future generations.
Is it good they are threatened?
By the great ecological fingerprint we left in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020, we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Secondly, the world's forum of nature.
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of...
Fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have generated a huge global warming, what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of cronic shortage of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignity.
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
So, although it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in all forms.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
Let me give you an example: imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Curring, fighting, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not to read that competition, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the technical body behind them.
Is it our body?
It's a pluricular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradogically, nature is the best model to assimilate and to perfectly achieve sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is missing in time has suffered catastrophs of glaciation, meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
In other words, but human beings continue creating linear thinking ideologies.
Toctrina is political, like drugs who failed communism, who failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has failed as well.
A study by Oxfan last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That is to say that they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that it takes care, because nature advises to obtain economic benefit, we have sent garbage to the outside and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Because biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
Life, my great imitation, life imitation.
But this is not new, it's already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you.
Make a game.
From imagination?
What happens to this wire?
How could engineers, architects, economists be inspired?
Well, it occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to the peak of the birds Mart√≠n Bolador?
The Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
Through this blue turtle.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bio-spiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature ...
It will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP.
What does PIB mean?
Many economists tell us we have to manufacture, to build.
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Can you imagine?
Is there a future for dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me.
At least you tried it, you fought.
And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What we have to say is that the quarantine isn't an opportunity and the pandemic isn't an opportunity, it's horrible things, we're not going to do everything missing.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically.
Believe me, lie.
We pass it bad, socially with good, we fool ourselves to our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do with respect, and not because you think it's an opportunity to take advantage of and we're not leaving if we don't take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do you say that?
Life has detected us something else, that goes through horrible moments and learning from them, we learn the pain of diseases.
We've always succeeded and we're going to happen by doing it.
So...
We're going to do that now.
And what I didn't have, thinking about entering.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, so cinema is right to the world.
It's the newspapers that have already brought me in the 80s when they diagnose it from H.V.
So he decides to return to his patient to the kindergarten, but that's not a filmmaker, which, in fact, later he diagnosed.
They are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the most important ones in their career.
But what he decides is that he will buy a little land instead, right? A horrible bread.
And he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
As a person writes.
For him, taking care of a kindergarten was not having time.
It wasn't, well.
The time went by.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking to San Pan or whatever.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And then they thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From Friy Gengers, basically.
And that later I took particularly the feminist morsimo.
To talk about reproductive work, not even reproductive work, which is the one that put new things in the world, we can say, always my father or a slap, it doesn't matter, and this is reproductive work, that reproducts the conditions for us to do that, clean, cook, and cook to the workers for the next day to put the factory or its own reproductive work.
And feminist for a long time now.
Aluming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
Now, why the edge of zero in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
Moreover, why don't we do as an insult and think that this difference is contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more inflictive difference given by one side.
And also due to modernity, and with the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that the gorilla does, which produces the volume in the world in which the subject that sets.
No, take care of?
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it doesn't make you an artist, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't make you care.
These are well-known values, we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We are living without publicists, without writers.
Seriously, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps moving.
But the world wasn't used to spinning without food.
And without care.
And without nurses?
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
Is it eating?
And clean.
And without that, the world doesn't act.
So?
Is it your tasks?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
They are not mechanical that we necessarily have to go up, that I hope there wouldn't exist, that I hope you could do this, clean the almost, cook, or solve food.
Maybe, we can think about it like this.
We have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans is that...
Just by peoples also living them differently.
Or are we going to live them?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modern nature, modernity, not like...
Human beings separated from the natural world that...
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
caring lesions with our bodies, we think we have to take care of the body, the script or the one...
Coffinada.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
But...
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
I think...
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
No, we all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now!
Of course, the world needs more soap operas.
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
Instead of being obsessed with being productive these days.
And knowing all the holes and all that, why not think?
to connect with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in a different way from that.
That's why, when I was invited to do this hall that I didn't, because I thought I didn't want to have an original idea, the world hadn't been that it was a soap opera and that the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write.
Bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I was...
I had my books and that might help other people, right?
More than writing, reading.
What else to do?
Thank you very much.
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat, bread, pastas, every 15 days, a weekend, these foods don't get fat.
What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them, but today I want to name you three key aspects.
The first one is awareness to have a good nutrition. One time a teacher told me: "Take awareness is high to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So yes, our wishes are high consciousness.
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one we like the most and after that, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating and what amount.
Why?
A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, we are not hungry.
It's hunger, hunger, hunger, and the warmer, and the desire becomes unforgettable to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
[A.DE.]
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
"Be, dream, hug, a burrow with twice?"
So, going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
In other words, pizza, nothing funny, I prefer a "guardolf".
Impossible, right?
The second aspect is practice: to eat, like every process in life, you learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
That my include represents itself.
Well, we must learn to eat in this station, what does this mean?
I mean, eating the foods that were costed at that time.
This is going to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and put a god in our health.
(Laughter) Because foods surrounded by their time are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients and they are not treated chemically to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
And necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruit all year long, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism, led to practice, will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony of eating always the same.
The last aspect that for me is not a small one, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
Why not?
Those who don't break, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because they often give them usories.
And I have a question.
They also give them Ausias.
Let's repeat the match plate with fruit?
Well, to think, right?
A: So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
In other words, hunger is not variable.
Yes, they restring foods, if they get out of eating, what is not consumed in the day is going to consume in the afternoon or at night and in double division.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volume.
And increasingly with more strength.
So, if we don't stop every three or four hours.
To take a swing.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
(Applause)
To finish?
Together with this, I want to unleash the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the cheaper jokes, I'm going to lose and not.
The most expert body becomes a reserve, store, and when I mean reserve, I mean this, I mean this, to everything we want to eliminate from our body.
Why?
Food doesn't only make you fat, it depends on us, we go out in favor of that ignorance, food can hurt you or can cure you, and become aware of what we are feeding us and what amount.
Well, I return to the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation, such food stimulates overweight.
To give a closure?
I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like.
To eat various, but always take care of the portion.
There's no reason that "Sayuna como rey" quote as a prince and dinner as a beggar.
I think many people know it: " health has excuses, I can't, there I don't, sometimes I died of hunger."
We have four opportunities every day to choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthy, thank you very much.
(Applause) Some time ago I've been obsessed with telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first time Marie Curie appeared.
They didn't give a Nobel Prize, they were given two, so they deserved their pedestal, but there are many others who didn't get a Nobel Prize, they did incredible things. I recently learned about Ugeneas' story.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
And it made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one that brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s, thanks to it, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less from 2002 that I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And you know what?
It died in 2011 when I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
And how I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that this made me find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female scientists, to honor those who were.
But, above all, to not lose those who are, thank you very much.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time at school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think so.
That we need or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They are bouncing from the century to the century for a long time.
Since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography a very clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond a letter.
Each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound.
They should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French.
He always had a strong resistance to write too different.
How do we say this?
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we would uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological.
The one who says that we have to write according to how words are written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and that's how we stay with Hesmudas, that we write, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with velargas and decorations that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the forecastation of the Spanish.
This is how we stayed with Jes.
That sometimes they are asperous as in people.
And sometimes they sound waves like in cats.
That's how we stayed with grains, feces, and comicks.
There are three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that time of plastic and child brain.
Indicate.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full of exceptions.
We were transmitted in many forms with implications and explained the idea that in ortography something was key to our training.
However, I have the feeling.
Until the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
ortography serves.
To uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example.
In ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved in the "yes".
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing, with ortography, no.
With ortography or is it good or bad?
Second, don't you add the right standards?
But then it wouldn't make sense to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use correctly ortography.
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
So that all that time we dedicate to teaching ortography today.
We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that everyone writes whatever they want.
Sign language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest possible.
Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling below, when ortography simplifies, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all.
I work every day with the literature of the 21st century, with a disclaimer, a snake, a Gongora, I see, that sometimes they write men, without H, sometimes they write with Becort.
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between those texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention still at the time, but not of quality.
But let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive, a long time ago, that teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the blame of broken, the educator of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is being written, we can be able or stop finding a job by a H, which put or stopped putting.
You can become an object of public mockery for once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers.
Or individuals related to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, with Andr√©s Bello, promoted the greatest ortographic reform that, effectively, had the place in the Spanish language, which was in Chile.
It's half-time.
In the 19th century.
Why not take the bet of those teachers?
And start advancing in our ortography I am here, in the intimacy of us the 10,000, I would like to put on the table some modifications that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate HMUDA.
There, where we wrote a H, but we didn't say anything, we didn't write anything, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone, all the records that HEMUDA cause us, B√©larga and B Corta said before, we'd never split the functions, that to the sound of their bird, cat, magician, √°guila, and that the Jotta retains the sound aspered.
Jalabe, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it cannot be an absolute principle, in some cases, prediction differences should be attended, now I said before, it feces in some places correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
And some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not that much.
The Spanish Academy Real, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified.
That language is linked to history, to traditions and customs, but that is also a practical tool for everyday use, and that sometimes the attachment to history, to traditions and customs, becomes an obstacle.
It's for today's use.
This explains, in fact, that our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically close, we were modifying historically ourselves. For example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we were of quantities, from symbol to symbol, and little by little, they start to remove, gluefully, some mud hits, in the dictionary of the Real Academia, harp, harmony, they can write, or without H.
And we're all fine.
Does it sound like me anyway?
That this is a moment.
Especially appropriated to deal with this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
That are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is an academic in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, much later, accepts them and incorpora.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to down. It was always the institutions that fixed the norms, it's less true for the level of words.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Until today.
writing always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks.
But at our time, the time of social networks.
That's suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now.
Never many wrote so much at the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale wild ortographic shapes.
Even people with impecable ortography, hyper-educated, when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
For now, there.
Copic abuses, individuals.
But I think we have to pay attention, because you're probably telling us that a time that advises writing, a new place, is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we'd do wrong to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be able with ortography, besides seeing Latin, Greek, Arabic, with simplified ortography, we will recover etymology at the same place where we go now, to etymological dictatorships.
A second served objection of those who say if we simplify ortography, we are going to stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we depositate, in the vast majority of situations, the context displays any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
It's more comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one that people say.
I don't want to change.
I was raised like this.
I got used like this when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "Brown my eyes."
(Laughter) This objection, in part, is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used to?
And it is expected that time feels the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits.
The consensus is in favor, the level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we get, so I think we have to agree that academics have to agree with and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us.
I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest field, but important of language, we'll be leaving the next generations a better future.
(Applause) Thank you before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris.
After his death, the reality didn't make sense, I didn't shake his eyes and tell me, "I had to understand life and death."
(Video ends) Maybe for my formation as a filmmaker.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
(Video) Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images, the discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
(Laughter) It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy.
It became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
To their death, more than an end.
It represented the beginning of where the project of my life is today.
This is the project.
For me, this teaches me.
That our pureest material essence.
We are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror.
There's perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
(Sigh) And that the matter doesn't believe or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
(Applause)
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
From the ability that the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A building of education.
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with pedagogies.
Digners, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
A mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advanced.
(Applause) Today, I'm not scientist, and I've been doing experiments in order to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From great loves, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home.
We stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners, human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, worldwide obsession could buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Do you want an unconscious logic?
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than on relevance.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
It's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology.
It calls the optimistic section.
The same here makes many of us handle or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages.
thinking that in reality nothing will happen to us.
It makes the major politicians in Europe and many world's tropicators lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen now?
To us.
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmatizing.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, Japan has been proposed that everyone uses more chairs.
This first makes people between Manorzabe not contagiate and this is very important, but also there is another reason, maybe more important, that is that if they are used in more stairs we get sick.
So this would be a sort of acusatory crossing.
Knowing who's sick and not because of whether they wear or not cards.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid self-esteem and this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've found the most in these days is our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that we really need motivation to do it.
This discovered it now, for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that was extremely difficult to change it.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the raw necessity.
And the world does revolve.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to limit individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also to govern ourselves and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we were, where we moved, to whom we found.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our viral load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this cost can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
The one in your son, if not at home, the one who is not at risk can go out.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the ask.
It disappears completely, but less people die, and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, the risk they were a bad use of them is still true.
There's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
I put that choice if you feel good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
A triple, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom.
That are fundamental values, pillars in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe we give our data a little bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When I spent all this.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free and care?
Are they going to fly less archions in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we realize that being part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think more freely than ever?
What do we want it to be the conservative sex of the coronavid?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia and Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples," are part of the sea's wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
Well, at that moment ...
I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea's dollar broke, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
But...
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
What is a quantity that we paleontologists?
We mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
It's a quantity of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago, I have traveled.
Effects and fossil studies from all over the planet, to try to figure out how the past of our planet was like in different regions, places like Mongolia, South of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
QD: Naturally we think of these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world.
To look for dinosaurs and the vast majority of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the creptic period.
This is already about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South Hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common mechanisms belonged to a family called "abelis√°uridos," while for that time, in the northern hemisphere, other families of carnivores fell, like water shots.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of South was not.
Surprisingly, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the North Hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, what we call the legal period about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her key meat specially 170 million years ago, when the dinosaurs for the first time.
They completely denied the planet.
For the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivorous carnivores of omnivorous worldwide.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years.
QD: With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships, we went to explore the rocks of the law in Patagonia.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon.
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
You see, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the size of a dinosaur.
I got closer, stood next to me, shooled.
I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and at the same time I knew it was, after studying years, bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the trash part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
Did you know it was one of those discoveries that happen?
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
To protect the rest in order to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given from winter.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
From the station?
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way its skeleton.
And that's where the stairs really begins: to launch, layer, those sediments that were burning.
Where it embraces us, it's a very exciting moment, for the first time it's going back to the surface.
An animal?
They lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Llenemal had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Then, all that buried rocket had to rise up to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a raise.
From all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
The layers contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those hills.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizures, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
That's what we thought.
That is, long before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate being due to a big ocean, at the time of Changea, when all continents were united in a big supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
It's, for example, of some rocks like these that we transport to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We went to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those mistake blocks.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now this dinosaur is very special, in addition.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur lines didn't look at the forms we contracted or knew from the northern hemisphere, studying its remains, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times, and this was not so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean hadn't yet formed, which is used today to these two continents, but once again, we had a case.
That is to say, of restricted animals, the only ones of the South hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Living on climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a big is true in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water.
What I had isolated these vaccines was not a desert full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs ...
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we've really told us fantastic, fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is in the history of life.
They have been diversified and conquered those of all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formed for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
BB: The Earth is a great book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
And life.
I listen to a prepondering place.
In this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That there are millions of pages still to read this book.
What if we really want to know our planet, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays?
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Yes!
It's also key.
To project a future.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dream of healing.
To find magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
So time.
It gives us a happiness bathroom.
Through the subway, you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
They saw empires invading small villages.
And you don't have the choice of standards to defend them.
But something like that as a child.
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Perhaps, the most important thing in this situation.
It's about living.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is, maybe.
The main part of all ideas, something like the zero idea of this I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Problising our mind with it.
Power and practical ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
These rings, fix bicycles.
Do you get a half-turn?
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
To develop in ourselves the habit.
We need to think and give time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I done the saying?
Who only has a bottle?
See all the problems like a slap.
But if we have to pull a ring, a ring is not good for us.
Not taking into account of his slap.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a beer.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools are called "Mental Mental Memes."
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 of them out of a hill.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to broaden the box of tools of our head.
Isn't it?
All the problems will show us a slap.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and at the table on the side.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or because of a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
I am alone.
But it didn't realize.
Of what?
When I say this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In Switzerland.
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was unplegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to really learn.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example.
I get angry and sorry liberated.
Or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale impacts what we're going to do.
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And impresions have emotions for us.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they didn't make us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those pressions generate emotion.
Fear.
And fear generates action.
That we are all now stored preventively what is moving.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times.
It's important to act when we don't see or feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Casting is one thing."
Is it hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward, you eat what you married.
But very different farms.
Do the effort now.
For something you're going to take advantage of in six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But the organism creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But it saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now!
That we still feel, we don't see.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we thought it would last six months.
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last.
The month are sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of the ship!
A high school classmate that would not be 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find something in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely.
To find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same.
Are there so many unlikable things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with human sense.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
Of serious things, even if they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
Why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And for people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
We can surround ourselves with people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
An interview Borges 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interview asked me, "That same answered to you."
This same question four years ago.
"Morofies, do you want the dog?"
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be accepted with new ideas.
The new ideas are emerging.
And to be always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
In other words, women are irrational beings, always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the cost of a man.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will get a good husband that you will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But the idea itself.
It has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, at all times.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 6 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here were already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school that just in 1965, 50 years ago, is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was from this idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
Help your husband.
It's an irrational being.
What a cisteric?
It was true, in fact, a century ago, women believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them, removing 5,000, maybe, believed this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've experienced in society, the idea that truth is true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world that exists out there is out there, we'll ever understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
Well, we're convinced it's on September 24th, because all of us here agrees with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendaries, or more they exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every goal we put is part of a very hard social construction that we have automated and naturalized, cats live without a calendar.
My dog sticks to the accelerator, and who is this world alone at home?
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I knew how long it had become.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked here, was a manzana, and wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
If the trips had passed, met the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
And...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born.
But if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing happens with what we are thinking now, and the same, political and social, revolutionary change.
How did we see it?
For thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years, they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost humanity by thinking how women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines, how much intelligence?
How much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that copy was created to study this process.
which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, but how in the Greeks and the Romans, and the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other transgeneree that occurred to you today, have always existed in all culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But he had never thought about it.
That the sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally, was created sexual identity.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral V√≠ctoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You'll do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to blame you, it's not true, it's a great social control. (Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man.
(Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man, that is.
That's going to blame you, it's going to blame you, and even if it gives you fault, you do it, and that's a terrible social control form, because it dominates us, dobly, on the one hand, do you know we can't stop it, it's as if we were deprived of eating?
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong, the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals, during a century, were terribly persecuted throughout the world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women previously, or the Jews or the blacks, and neuroscience have been from slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some cases today is ideal.
But we all live much better free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, that 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood. This is just about getting up now, in many parts of the world, today, are completely legal. This was possible by the paradigm change.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
(Laughter) For them to respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, so they respect me as black, just black and the same homosexual.
And gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people, that I might not like to like a guy, what do I know, but however, we have to take that?
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
From prisons.
50 years ago, look how old I am.
I was a homosexual boy.
I didn't know what it was to do a homosexual child, I didn't know the word homosexual, and they didn't tell me that, my schoolmates told me, "I'm going to blow you!" (Laughter) And I didn't know what it was to be dumb, I didn't look at me, and I didn't know what it was to be fun, that was something I had in me, my father, who loved me, looked at me.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so bad for it to come out like this?
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
Do you have a positive side?
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With translator, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I am also a person, saying that I am complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
20 or 30 years ago this idea had been having.
That it arises from understanding that the facts don't exist, that they exist ...
(Laughter) (Applause) The contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it, we're contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume standing there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said, and when I dress it, because when an idea is in charge, it doesn't move, while we have it on our head, it doesn't serve us.
I made her body, I left prison.
And I left prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
I'm today, or they told me that there's a list of things we need to survive, called basic canasta.
That weird idea, living constantly with this rough, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community, has the things we need to survive, and if it had the things we need.
To explore?
But exploring is something difficult, scary, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement brings us extraordinary situations, to adapt, it's a moment.
Largo or little, full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
When everything I did, I erased by someone else's voices, you voice, mystery, microphone, that I duplicated the intensity of your ideas and besides all those ghosts that establish it, but once you say it, once you can get your words, you take an avalanche of ideas that come to you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain and you are about choosing, seeing your paraguas and covering them, or doing a side and your dad has each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy, of following, of returning, jumping, or running.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not called.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, movements created them, movements that bring them to moments like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that will probably not be an artwork, but will allow you to revive the exact way in which those stars were seen.
The formula I saw that face when I spoke about what I liked the most, the speed was the one that went to your heart.
Or how do you break when talking?
That voice, that voice that you know so much, that knows that I'm probably looking for something that you lose.
That voice, your best friend.
You just have to be there forever.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little pile to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend.
Without that, yes, without that, it's a canasta, I cannot survive.
What we grew up in girls cities.
I'm sure that we once chose.
The opportunity to get "Made, niega" to do, I can't go on a stable job, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
There, I always appear on a person's scene for what you'll see, it's already in years.
He is born and with a belly, wakes up his experience, but Federica.
(Laughter) They come to remind us that all the past was better.
(Laughter) Is this really the case?
And maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
When I think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of the whole life, and Juancho, a ranch in Manuel.
These photos you're seeing there.
It's from 2009 when I live in high school.
What can I say to my friends?
I love it a lot, which are like my brothers, and which are three people super capable that, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to stay like to study what they liked, they stayed here in the city.
And be surprised, until today, you can't get a job that allows you to fulfill your dreams.
While me, it would be the port in this picture.
A brand of the absence of opportunities also became present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort on human beings so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I was afraid to know that if they stayed here in the city...
I could study something, but probably the future as a person was so short of opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
We live in the middle of the 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress, let's be a speed that surprise us all and collapse the borders and the barriers that exist between people, in this context.
Cities to be increasingly more important.
Let's be honest, it's our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
(Laughter) It is estimated that in 2050.
68 percent of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more people choose to live in cities...
What is the workshop where we have more chance to progress?
What is the reason why, while weapons cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everybody wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them?
(Laughter) Here I'm going to tell you a key word that you want the cow to get when they get out of that door to get home: strategy.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
(Laughter) Besides my concern, as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens exactly for this.
To connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminate way, but assenting our strengths, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you may ask: How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through complete projects.
What is the quality of life of the population?
The migration arrives.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, so you can get up and notice a couple of things. First, we add a fifth friend, friend, and the group, do you know what it is?
A drink of gas alcohol.
Secondly, we can also say that it gives a kind of investment relationship as it improves the quality of the photos of the phones.
What we are in it is going to improve, some have a couple of kilos of more and others have to make the star.
(Laughter) Do you know what we share until today, beyond the profound software we have of light, our bodies?
The mark of the lack of opportunities.
Franco, for example, who is also the one of her.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2012.
A national champion.
But today, even if you want to study in geography teachers, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday to Monday working to be able to live.
Then you sign up, you think the one on my left is stronger, that just up there.
How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces in the best country?
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, since then I'm changing my career without being able to find what passion really was, and I can't get a job that allows a certain economic independence.
(Laughter) Finally, he is to Manuel, a computer genius, but they don't know anything about life's genius.
But do they tell them?
We work all day in his place that built from nothing itself.
Time studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
It's that we, as young, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
(Laughter) As soon as I was in English, I was lucky enough to be chosen among a group of 8 cobertidents worldwide.
To participate in a weekend in New Adel and the capital of India.
I traveled in Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
Audience: Yes!
Besides saying it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I would like to share with you today are accidents.
There are millions and I will never be able to say this with sufficient emphasis so that you can train, but there are millions of opportunities outside.
But you have to be willing to find them, they don't come alone.
Our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I don't have any complaint or young people, nor the Chinese, nor anyone.
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
What do you want?
And a state that is there to come out to the world and bring the opportunities to them to act to develop themselves.
Once again.
We want better cities, go out strategically to the world.
I don't remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I met to go to study, with three days to turn 18.
They were me, very scared, with a lot of fear.
(Laughter) This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to have a city.
What to study?
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Forget, everything will be something.
Who's from my friends?
And nobody you know.
No, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
(Laughter) In the end, the most beautiful thing remains to the city that's coming to make you.
And with one of the strategies we can do.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco.
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or to not go so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to follow here.
That's it?
Like that!
Like that!
You see the lack of opportunities.
Yes!
All of this.
And I'm telling you this.
It doesn't seem to be enough argument.
Do you want another example?
That's fine.
(Sigh) This one.
Is tattoo?
And she tells me, when finally I could overcome deep depression.
In which I fell, for having feet in my city.
After two intentions of suicide.
Enumerable, psychological sequences.
And he told me.
Much, a lot of your arms.
If we want these things to stop going?
We have to go out strategically to the world.
We don't commit a final point to our cities, thank you very much.
(Applause) I am a surgeon.
Since always the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work.
We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years.
My research.
In my case, in the sofa, it was based on it.
In searching for the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
Of course not alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
What does this mean?
We do it.
With biological platforms.
They are like maps.
We give them to the tissue.
To use their own ability.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What seemed science fiction previously.
Today it's almost daily, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients.
That they avoided.
To have to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
"I have it."
Every time.
More work.
(Laughter) I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a time like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Yes!
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese and I think that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to be a first question.
Why, Japan?
He could avoid the biggest impact of the contagium.
If it was in January, the first case went on.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
In other words, having the population of the third older age in the world.
(Applause)
Singing in the second country with more smokers for a number of inhabitants.
Why in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but it's a progress that hurts.
And the identified?
Until now.
We know this new virus runs a very contagious virus.
In these demographic data, Japan introduced us a cocoter that would enable a great propagation of the disease, basically.
Many people, not so much.
And a fourth of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society.
Education in a way that answers organicly and united to any event that compromises her.
Japan passed through war, Tifions, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, transgenation, has had to support disasters.
The natural resources contained by man.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams.
For example.
What team of soccer will have better performances in a critical moment?
The team that train every day.
It has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
Social distancing directives.
And yes, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether in society or in our own homes.
The Japanese population has not established, it's been hundreds of years ago.
And you don't need to say no to embrace yourself.
Don't give up because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
That is to say, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
(Laughter) You don't have to invite, it's not to torch or shoot on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board when they feel reflected.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
(Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that two Western teachers did in a school in Japan.
I mean, you'll surely know the sillas' game.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get out of one.
In each round.
And this experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves E.
It chooses this way of being.
It's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
In the example there are children, but we can see how a collective society works.
(Sigh) Do you help yourself?
Because every enemy contributes to the good of everyone.
