(Laughter) I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
And I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
Great!
We need to learn to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water, with that feeling of pregnancy, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, turtles, molamous fish.
And from fish from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
A: At that time, I observed as a little bird.
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
And it was an intense spiritual feeling, and it makes what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, talks to fish, right?
And it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
Why?
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
QD: I work 24 hours for a week.
To draw that work of art that we're going to see and that I'm not crazy, or on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that mandala we see, proves that nature has awareness, and if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
And in fact, I bring you more scientific proves.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
(Applause)
Paradoxically, in an amazing way, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
(Sigh) According to the clayber law.
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
The planet we live in.
It is composed of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development and here they bring you a summary.
(Laughter) And I remember with scientific consensus, the TikTAN's explosion, the Earth planet was formed in very simple levels, with the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated, and the higher, with the Cambrical exclusion of the interface, the biological variety has increased a large speed.
Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species, that Cocoa has about 4 million years, homorectus around 2 million years, both the rest of its rich diversity, since the agricultural revolution, who domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago, the human being has been adapting the environment in a transcendental way, as something unsustainable.
Specially between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species?
A single species, an itan more, is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
A: This half of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And although it seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees integrated.
And if that was not enough, future generations are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we leave in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
So, since the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020 it's been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
In other words, according to the world's forum of nature.
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
So, in addition, the use of...
Fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have generated a huge global warming, what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources will be able to develop in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
So, although it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in all forms.
In life, in nature, what defines what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
Let me give you an example: imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Curring, fighting, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
Well, what defines life is not to read that competition, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the technical body behind them.
Your body?
It's a pluricellular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradogically, nature is the best model to assimilate and to perfectly achieve sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is missing in time has suffered catastrophs of glaciation, meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
In other words, human beings continue creating linear thinking ideologies.
Toctrina is political, like drugs who failed communism, who failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has failed as well.
A study by Oxfan last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That is to say that they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that it takes care, because nature advises to obtain economic benefit, we have sent garbage to the outside and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
That is, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
Lifestyle, my huge imitation, life imitation, but this is not new, it's already been doing it in the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you to play a game.
I have an imagination, what happens to this turtle?
How could engineers, architects, economists be inspired?
Well, they thought of making a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
But the Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites?
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
With this sun turn.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bio-spiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature ...
To be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP. What does GDP mean?
Many economists tell us we have to manufacture, to build.
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Can you imagine?
I'm going to tell you a future for dialogue with your children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me.
At least you tried it, you fought.
And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What we have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's horrible things, we won't do everything missing.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically.
Award, a lie.
We feel bad, socially with good, we fool ourselves to our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do with the appearance, and not about why you think it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of it and that we're not leaving of something if we don't take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do you say that?
Life has detected us something else, that goes through horrible moments and learning from them, we learn the pain of diseases.
We'll always do it and we'll keep doing it.
So...
We're going to do that now.
And what I didn't have, thinking about entering.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, that cinema is right to the world.
These are the newspapers that have already taken me in the 80s when they diagnosed with HIV and then decide to return to their passion to childhood to kindergarten, but exams from a filmmaker, which, in fact, later, was diagnosed.
They are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the most important ones in their career.
But what he decides is that he will buy a little tree in an unexpected and horrible place.
And he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
As a person writes.
For him, taking care of a kindergarten was not having time.
It wasn't, well.
The time went by.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking towards bread or whatever.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And then they thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From the Fri of Gengers, basically, and who later took particularly the next feminist.
To talk about reproductive work, not even reproductive work, which is the one that put new things in the world, we can say, always my father or a slap, it doesn't matter, basically you can cook to the workers so that the next day they could put the factory, their reproductive work.
And feminist for a long time now.
Aluming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
Now, why the edge of zero in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
Moreover, why don't we do as an insult and think that this difference is contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more inflictive difference given by one side.
Of course, gender, because of the idea that there are important tasks, these are the producers to decrease mentalized by the speakers, and the reproductive ones cross paths with women in important, and also given by modernity, and by the idea that the subject that takes care.
No, take care of?
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't make you an important person, right?
These are well-known values, we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We're living without wrists, without writer.
In a lot of things, I was moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food and without care.
And without nurses?
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
Is it eating?
And clean.
And without that, the world doesn't act.
So?
Is it your tasks?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
They are not mechanical that we necessarily have to go up, that I hope there wouldn't exist, that I hope you could do this, clean the almost, cook, or solve food.
You can, how do you think like that?
We have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans is that...
I also start living them differently.
Or are we going to live them?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title wasn't modern nature.
Human beings separated from the natural world that...
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
The relationship of care with our bodies, we think we have to take care of the body, the gym, we have to cook.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
She looked at me.
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are and that the body is going to be something we have to overcome.
I think...
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
No, we all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now!
Of course, the world needs more soap operas.
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
Instead of being obsessed with being productive these days.
And knowing all the holes and your stuff, why not think?
to connect with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in a different way from that.
That's why, when I was invited to do this passive thing, because I thought I didn't want to have an original idea, the world hadn't been that novel and the world doesn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought, actually, we're going to write that I had to bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what was already there, with my books, and that maybe other people are useful, right?
More than writing it down.
What else to do?
Be careful.
Thank you very much.
One time, a teacher told me, "The consciousness is ordered in which we consume them." "what fats up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them." "I would like to name them passports every 15 days, "no more sweet," "no more poor," "out more stressed," "no more sweet", "out more stress," "out more stress," "no more sweet."
And after that, we are aware that we are feeding and eating, so if we take secondary awareness to our desires, if not, on the contrary, the one we like the most, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs, and in which quantity.
A good fact is not going to the super hungry because when we are hungry, we are not hungry.
It's hunger, hunger, hunger, and the warmer, and the desire becomes unforgettable to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast foods, is constantly thinking throws.
A run with double fromage: bee, dream, hug.
So, going back to the topic, are we really able to say pizza, I prefer an aguardolf, a hug?
The second aspect is practice, impossible, right? We should learn to eat in this station what this means, and in this case, and in many cases, that my include remains, to eat the food that were costly at that time.
This is going to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and put a god in our health.
Because foods that were made of its time are the richest food in nutrients and are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
Or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer, or it's normal to see fruit all year and necessary for our bodies.
The last aspect that for me is not less, but one of the most important, is moderation, it will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall into monotony to eat always the same.
Those who don't break, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give usories.
I have a question to you: Who gives you a chance to repeat the match plate with little fruit?
To think, then, what do I mean with this, what hunger is accumulated?
That hunger is not variable.
Yes, they restring foods, if they get out of eating, what is not consumed in the day is going to consume in the afternoon or at night and in double division.
To make it more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top, increasingly its size, increasingly its volume and its strength.
So, if we don't stop each three to take a break, four hours.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
to finish.
In putting, together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, and when I'm talking about reserving myself, I mean this, I mean this, and all we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat, food can hurt you or can cure you, it depends on us of taking awareness about what we are feeding and what amount.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation, I come back, the moderation, the kind of food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure, I propose you to eat rich, eat various, but always take care of the portion, eat everything you like and eat as a beer.
I think many of us know it: health has excuses to choose how to take care of and eat healthily.
(Applause) Some time ago I've been obsessed with telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first time Marie Curie appeared.
They didn't give a Nobel Prize, they were given two, so they deserved their pedestal, but there are many others who didn't get a Nobel Prize, they did incredible things. I recently learned about the history of Ugeneas to bedote. Igenia was an Italian doctor who migrated to Argentina at the time of the second war.
And it made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one that brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s, thanks to it, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less from 2002 that I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004 and they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her. And you know what?
In 2011, I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
And how I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that this made me find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female scientists, to honor those who were.
But, above all, to not lose those who are, thank you very much.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think so.
That we need or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They are bouncing from the century to the century for a long time.
Since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography a very clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond a letter.
Each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound.
They should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French.
He always had a strong resistance to write too different.
How do we say this?
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that guided a large part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological.
The one who says that we have to write according to how words are written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and that's how we stay with Hesmudas, that we write, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with velargas and decorations that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the forecastation of the Spanish, so we stayed with a gesture.
That sometimes they are asperous as in people.
And sometimes they sound waves like in cats, so we stay with ces, feces and zets.
There are three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
All of us invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that plastic brain time, childly, indicated.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full of exceptions.
We were transmitted in many forms with implications and explained the idea that in ortography something was key to our training.
However, I have the feeling.
Until the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
ortography serves.
To uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example.
In ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved in the "yes".
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing, with ortography, no.
With ortography or is it good or bad, depending on adjusted or doesn't add the current rules?
But then it wouldn't make sense to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use correctly ortography.
Wouldn't it be meaning to simplify the current rules so that all that time we dedicate to teaching ortography today?
We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want, language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest possible.
Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling below, when ortography simplifies, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all.
I work every day with the literature of the 21st century of orthorelon, Margarce, servant, gongora, I see, that sometimes they write men, without H, sometimes they write with Becort.
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between those texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention still at the time, but not of quality.
But let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a bit irreflexic with the teachers who hurt us and hurt us with ortography, but the truth is that when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the blame of broken, the educator of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is being written, we can be able or stop finding a job by a H, which put or stopped putting.
You can become an object of public mockery for once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout history of our language, we were always teachers, or individuals related to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reform, sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, strandings, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the greatest ortographic reform, which effectively took place in the Spanish language, which was the one in Chile, in the middle.
In the 19th century.
Why not take the bet of those teachers?
And start advancing in our ortography I am here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I would like to put on the table some modifications that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's organize HMUDA.
There where we write a H, but we don't say anything, we choose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argue, not with one, let's eliminate the other: "Ge, hijota, let's divide the function, which kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone, all the fathers that cause us the sound, "asper."
Jalabe, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it cannot be an absolute principle, in some cases, prediction differences should be attended, now I said before, it feces in some places correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
(Laughter) Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not that much.
The real Spanish Academy, all the gyms of language, also believe that ortography should be modified, and that sometimes the attachment to history, to traditions and customs, becomes an obstacle.
For today's use, this explains in fact that our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically close, we were modifying historically ourselves. For example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we were of quantity, we were from symbol to symbol. And from now on, some mud hits start to take away in the dictionary of the Real Academia, harp, harmony, they can write with H or H.
And we're all fine.
Does it sound like me anyway?
This is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
That are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is an academic in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, much later, accepts them and incorpora.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to down, it was always the institutions that fixed the rules.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks, but at our time, the era of social media.
That's suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now.
Never many wrote so much at the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale wild ortographic shapes.
Where even people with impecable and pereducated ortography, when they write on social networks, behave quite similar to how most users of social networks behave, that is, relate ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
For now, there.
There are chaotic and individual uses, but I think we have to pay attention, because they are probably telling us that once they are assigned to writing, new criteria, I think we would do bad to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with simplified ortography, we will recover etymology at the same place where we go now, to etymological dictatorships.
A second served objection of those who say if we simplify ortography, we are going to stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem, our language has homony, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we depositate in the vast majority of the situations, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
What about me?
It's more comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one that people say.
I don't want to change.
I was educated like this, I got used like this when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "Bro my eyes hurt."
(Laughter) This objection, in part, is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used to?
And it is expected that time feels the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits is in the prudence of consensus, high level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we get, so I think we have to agree that academics have to agree with and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us.
I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest field, but important of language, we'll be leaving the next generations a better future.
(Applause) Thank you before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
After his death, the reality didn't make sense, he had the coffee eyes with an accomplishment around theiris and tell me, "You didn't hang your eyes, you had to understand life and death."
(Video ends) Maybe for my formation as a filmmaker.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe, it was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
(Laughter) This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared, I didn't feel disconnection of anything nor of anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
Audience: Good afternoon.
For me, this teaches me.
That our most pure material essence, we are accarded by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror there is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
(Sigh) And that the matter doesn't believe or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
(Applause)
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
From the ability that the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A building of education.
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
So, an agency with pedagogies.
Digners, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should come to the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advanced.
(Applause) Today, I'm not the scientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From great loves, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home.
We stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, worldwide obsession could buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Who is the unconscious logic?
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than the answer.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
It's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology, called "the optimist section."
The same goes for many of us to drive or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in reality, nothing will happen to us.
It made the major politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but more moral or social.
Why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmatizing.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, Japan has been proposed that everyone uses more chairs.
The first thing makes people who are among lower know doesn't contain and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you use more stages we get sick.
So this would be a sort of acusatory crossing.
Knowing who's sick and not because of whether they wear or not cards.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid self-esteem and this.
Enjoy us all.
Maybe what we've found the most in these days is our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that we really need motivation to do it.
This was discovered until now, where years ago we thought education couldn't change and that it was those things that was extremely difficult to change them.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the previous need.
And the world does revolve.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to limit individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also to govern ourselves and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we were, where we moved, to whom we found.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our transitory load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this cost can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
The one in your son and not at home, the one who is not at risk can go out.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the ask.
It disappears completely, but less people die, and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that they do a bad use of them is still true.
There's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
I put that choice if you feel good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
A triple, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom.
That are fundamental values, pillars in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe we give our data in a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When I spent all this.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free and care?
Are they going to fly less avions in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we be OK to take part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever.
What do we want it to be the compreservative sex of the coronavid?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia and Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nothing.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples," are part of the sea's wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea's dollar broke, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
What is a number we paleontologists?
We mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
It's a quantity of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well, life has led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago, I have traveled.
Effects and fossil studies from all over the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
B.G: Naturally we think of these forest landscapes, lagos, near the Andes mountains.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the temperature period, this is already about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common candles belonged to a family called "abelisáurios," while for that time, in the northern hemisphere, other families of carnivores faded, like, for example, water shots.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of South was not...
Surprisingly because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the North Hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her Mantoklave, especially 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs for the first time completely dominated the planet.
AC: For the first time they achieved gigantic size, for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivorous carnivores of omnivorous in the whole planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagone Law.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon.
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
You see, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the size of a dinosaur.
I got closer, stood next to me, shooled.
I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and Bello knew it was, after studying years of bones and anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the track part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
Did you know it was one of those discoveries that happen?
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was already over, we didn't count on the team, nor the time needed to seem a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given from winter.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
From the station.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
Great!
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way its skeleton.
And that's where the stage really begins: to skipping up, layer, those sediments that were burning.
Where it opened us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time, it's coming back to the surface.
An animal?
They lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Llenemal had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Then, all that buried rocket had to rise up to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a raise.
From all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those hills looking for.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizures, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
That's what we thought.
That is, long before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate being due to a big ocean, at the time of Changea, when all continents were united in a big supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transported to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside, and after nine months of work in the lab we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those rock blogs.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now this dinosaur is very special, in addition.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
It's a very, very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the tip of the head at the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur lines didn't look at the forms we contracted or knew from the northern hemisphere, studying its remains, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times, and this was not so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean hadn't yet formed, which is used today to these two continents, but once again, we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Living on climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a big is true in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy who had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these faines, it wasn't a full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs ...
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are going to really content fantastic, fansifascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is in the history of life.
They have been diversified and conquered those of all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formed for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
BB: The Earth is a great book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
And life.
I hear a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
There are still millions of pages to read this book.
What if we really want to know our planet, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays?
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Yes!
It's also key.
To project a future, thank you.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dream of healing.
To find magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
So time.
It gives us a happiness bathroom.
Through the subway, you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
They saw empires invading small villages.
And you don't have the choice of standards to defend them.
But something like that as a child.
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation.
It's about living.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is, maybe.
The main part of all ideas, something like the zero idea of this I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Going back to our mind with it.
Power and practical ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
These rings, fix bicycles.
Do you get a half-turn?
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
They develop us the habit.
We need to think and give time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I done the saying?
Who only has a bottle?
See all the problems like a slap.
But if we have to pull a ring, a ring is not good for us.
Not taking into account of his slap.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a beer.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools are called "Mental Mental Memes."
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 of them out of a hill.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
Isn't it?
All the problems will be worried to us.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and at the table on the side.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or because of a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
I am alone.
But it didn't realize.
Of what?
When I say this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In Switzerland.
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was unplegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to learn from him.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example.
A beam and sorry liberated.
Or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale impacts what we're going to do.
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they made us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those expressions generated emotion.
Fear.
And fear generates action.
That we are all now stored preventively what is moving.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Casting is one thing."
Is it hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward, you eat what you married.
But very different farms.
Do the effort now.
For something you're going to take advantage of in six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But winning creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But it saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now!
That we still feel, we live.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we thought it would last six months.
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last a month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
It's walking through a little town in the middle of the ship!
A high school classmate who wouldn't do it 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find something in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But, as we know so many people.
It's very likely.
To find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same.
Are there so many unlikable things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
Of serious things, even if they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
Why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And for people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
We are surrounded by people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
A forest interview 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interview asked me, "That same answered to you."
This same question four years ago.
"Mor did it," "Do you want Caixado?"
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be accepted with new ideas.
The new ideas are emerging.
And to be always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
In other words, women are irrational beings, always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the cost of a man.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will get a good husband that you will have to take care of.
(Laughter) This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 19:30s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 6 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here were already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school that just in 1965, 50 years ago, is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was from this idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
Help your husband.
which is a irrational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, women believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them, removing 5000, maybe, they believed in this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the amazing transformation mass in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've experienced in society, the idea that truth is true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world that exists out there is out there, we'll ever understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
Well, we're convinced it's on September 24th, because everything we're here agrees with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the 500 or more calendaries, every thing we say, every thing we think, every goal we live without a calendar.
My dog sticks to the accelerator, and who is this world alone at home?
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I knew it, what time had become.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked here, was a manzana, and wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
If the trips had passed, met the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born.
But if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the technique that the facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field, the revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost humanity by thinking that women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines, how much intelligence?
How much creativity?
In other words, wrong ideas are monstrous, there's an idea we can make.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that copy was created to study this process.
which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, but how in the Greeks and the Romans, and the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other, transgenerees that occurred to you today, have always existed in all culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But it had never thought that the sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally, was created sexual identity.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Víctoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
You'll do it with guilt, that is, it's going to blame you, it's going to blame you, and even if it gives you fault, and then that's a terrible social control form, because it dominates us, dobly, on one hand, do you know we can't leave, as if they deprived us of eating?
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals, during a century, were terribly persecuted throughout the world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women previously, or the Jews or the blacks, and neuroscience have been from slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some cases today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, 50 years ago, homosexuals are still condemned to be exhausted, but there's a drama of social fights, and it's that you have to get in jail, that discriminated me.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To be respected as a woman, I have to be just a woman, so that they respect me as black, only black and the same thing as gay, and the gay, the Jews, the blacks, the white people, we are all complete, complex people against advertisers, that maybe I don't have to accept that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
From prisons.
50 years ago, in which old Sun, I was a homosexual boy.
I didn't know what a homosexual kid was like, and my school classmates told me, "I'll screw you up!" (Laughter) and I didn't know what it was, I came back home, it was something I had in me, I didn't know that my father, who loved it, looked at me.
And it made me feel what I would have done so bad for it to come out like this.
What was that?
And I had to learn what it was like, I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
Do you have a positive side?
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got into a terrible prison, which was to make 24 hours out there.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world, I am against dictatorship, I am complete, I am complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I am also a person, saying that I am complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
20 or 30 years ago this idea had been having.
That it arises from understanding that the facts don't exist, that they exist ...
(Laughter) The contradictions and it's going to say, because it's really that, we're contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to take the risk to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said, and when I face it, because when an idea is so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
I am, or they told me that there's a list of things we need to survive, Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to survive, which is the idea of living constantly with this rough, called the basic rough, what strange is to live constantly with this rough?
But exploring is something difficult, scary, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement brings us extraordinary situations, adapting it is a long or small moment, full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
When everything I did, I erased by someone's voices, you, I'm not even in a microphone, that I duplicated the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, but once you say it, once you can take your words, you take an avalanche of ideas that come to you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate, but learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement, a class is not in love.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, movements created them, movements that bring them to moments like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, but they will allow you to review the exact way in which those stars were seen.
The formula I saw that face when I talked about what I loved the most, the speed wanted her heart, or how she broke you when she spoke about that voice, that forest so much you know, that she knows that you are probably looking for something that you lost.
That voice, your best friend.
You just have to be there forever.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little pile to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without a dunk, I can't survive.
What we grew up in girls cities, which I'm sure and with a belly, according to their experience, if it wasn't from the goal, that comes to remind us that all the time it was better.
(Laughter) Is this really the case?
When I think about this that I love you a lot, which are like my brothers, I inevitably remember my friends from all my life, and that they are three super capable, that are an effort on humans that I could study what I liked, regarding me, that I am the room in this photo, Franco, in Manuel, and I am surprised, what can I say to my friends?
I could study something, but probably my future as a person was so short of opportunities.
(Laughter) Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
68 percent of the world population will live in a city, we will make the sincere. In this context, cities are estimated that, in 2050, the borders and the barriers that exist among people, we live in the middle of the 21st century.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more people choose to live in cities, it means there are places where we have more chances to progress.
What is the reason why, while the weapons of cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everybody wants to visit them and everybody wants to live in them here, when they leave the door to return to their homes, this strategy?
And if we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
(Laughter) In addition to my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely by this, by connecting the cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) Now you may ask me: How do you see all this beautiful thing I'm telling you in real life?
Through concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population, prevent migration.
So, inevitably, I remember them, my friends.
Secondly, it's also like saying that a kind of investment relationship is given to what it is, it's a photo of a few months ago, and so little ones can notice a couple of things. First, we add a fifth friend, be the group, but what we were in it is going to improve.
For example, the one who's fine about this photo, but today, even if you want to dedicate it, they had geography teachers, it doesn't have time, because it has to be from Monday students working, simply to live, national champion.
(Laughter) Later, after which I wanted to study something related to the field of passion, and I can't even get a job that allows some economic independence, but after that I, that was just their birthday.
We work all day in his place that built from nothing itself.
Time studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs.
What I'm telling you is that, just in English, I had the immense fortune of being chosen between a group of 8 cobernitis group worldwide to participate in a weekend in New Dell, the capital of India, we, as young people, have absolutely nothing.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I'd like to share with you, there are millions that I will never be able to say this with sufficient emphasis for you to understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
You have to be willing to find them, they don't come alone.
But not less important, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I don't have any complaint or young people, nor the Chinese, nor anyone.
Do you know what differences we don't have, that have a state present to come out to the world and bring them opportunities so they can develop themselves?
(Laughter) Once we give better cities, we know strategically where.
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I met to go to study, with three days to turn 18.
They were me, very scared, with a lot of fear.
(Laughter) This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to have a city that studying is like leaving a piece of your heart, until today it's been like this, almost six years went by.
The parachutes don't have to be something.
To your friends, not to anyone you know, it's necessary to provide tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
And in the end, what's most beautiful to be allies to the city they had made you?
And with a strategy.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco if it had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or how much if today they were in a country?
Or to not go so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to move forward.
That's it?
So...
You see the lack of opportunities.
Thank you!
All of this.
And I disappointed telling you, it doesn't seem to be enough argument.
Do you want another example?
(Whispering)
(Whistles) This one.
That tattoo that tells me, when finally, depression 20, I could overcome when I fell for having feet in my city.
After two attempts of unnumerable suicide, psychological sequences that cost me.
A lot, a lot of well-known ones.
If we want these things to stop happening, we have to go out strategically.
Please, we don't eat a final point in our cities, thank you very much.
(Applause) I am a surgeon.
Since always the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work ...
We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years.
My research.
In my case, in the sofa, it was based on it.
In searching for the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
Of course not alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
We do this.
With biological platforms.
They are like maps we give to the tissue.
To use their own ability.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What seemed science fiction previously.
Today it's almost daily, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients that prevented.
To have to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
"I have it."
Every time.
More work.
(Laughter) I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a time like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Yes!
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese and I think that certain behaviors and social and individuals of the Japanese society can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to be a first question.
Why, Japan?
He could avoid the biggest impact of the contagium.
If it was in January, the first case went on.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
Teachers, having the population of the third age, such a world.
(Applause)
Singing in the second country with more smokers for a number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear advance and identified one.
Until now.
We know this new virus was cured a very contagious virus.
In these demographic data, Japan introduced us a cocoter that would enable a great propagation of the disease, basically.
Many people, not so much.
And a fourth of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society.
Education in a way that answers organicly and united to any event that compromises her.
It went through wars, tifons, Japan and tsunami.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, transgenation, has had to support disasters.
Naturals contained by man.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performances in a critical moment?
The team that train every day.
It has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
Social distancing directives.
And yes, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether in society or in our own homes.
The Japanese population has not established, it's been hundreds of years ago.
And you don't need to say no to embrace yourself.
Don't give up because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
That is to say, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
(Laughter) You don't have to invite, it's not to torch or shoot on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board when they feel reflected.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
(Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that two Western teachers did in a school in Japan.
I mean, you'll surely know the sillas' game.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get out of one.
In each round.
And this experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves E.
It chooses this way of being.
It's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
In the example there are children, but we can see how a collective society works, it helps itself.
Because every enemy contributes to the good of everyone.
