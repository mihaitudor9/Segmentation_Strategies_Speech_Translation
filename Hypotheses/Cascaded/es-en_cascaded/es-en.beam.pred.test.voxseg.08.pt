I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me with it.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
In other words, learning to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
With that feeling of pregnancy, surrounded by a huge biodiversity.
Confects, corals, turtles, shaped fish.
And fish from all colors.
I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Great!
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling, and it makes what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, talks to fish, right?
So it's the same thing my students think at university, every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say, "Gee, the teacher is crazy."
A: But I'm not crazy.
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
The work lasts 24 hours a week.
For you to draw?
Well, that work of art we're going to see.
Or the opposite?
The maritime current would take it, that sentence we see proves that nature has awareness.
Well, and I'm not crazy.
And if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples from the original peoples?
They can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena.
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific evidence, last year Science magazine published a study where 1,200 ecosystems of diverse still are analyzed.
Scientists?
They said there is a mathematical pattern of 3/4 between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern, reproduces our inner, in our organic physiology.
And according to Clayber's law.
It's an elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
But three, four.
And if you stop to think about it?
And the planet we live in?
It is composed of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
CR: Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
So, after thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study.
It's the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
And the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of human beings.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should mimic and perfect to achieve a sustainable development.
And here you bring a summary.
I agree with scientific consensus.
It's like the explosion of the Big Bang.
The universe emerged 13.7 billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.500 and 5 billion years.
And the miracle of life.
Between 3800 and 3500 million years old.
During the first half of this period, the life forms of the Earth stayed at very simple levels.
According to the apparition of free oxygen in the atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated, the nurses.
With the change of methaneous exclusion, biological variety has increased at a great speed, creating a wide range of multicellular organisms.
Because we are developing survival strategies.
Succents of very singular energy, like, for example.
DB: Cadina.
The accident seems to indicate that life followed and the depths of the oceans, couldn't reach the Earth until 450 million years ago.
With the disappearance of the dinosaurs of theoretical period, 66 million years ago, the hegemonic period of mammals appeared a bit later, the first or pioneer minds appeared.
Thanks to the possible remains found up until done, it's known that autolopytes have around 4 million years.
The homosexuals are the two million, toothpaste sneakers and homo sapis, 200,000 years old.
Currently, Homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species that cohabits and co-evolves around the planet Earth, pointing to the rest of its rich decodiversity.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago and especially since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago.
Human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed.
It was like something unbearable.
It's a species between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, a single species.
A new one?
It is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of species.
And that is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
Because life is a cosmic miracle, that we must preserve and preserve everything.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
In this half of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
It seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees degrees.
And why if that was little?
future generations are also threatened by the great ecological fingerprint we leave in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: Since 1990, until 2020, it's proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Do I follow the world's forum of nature?
All of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitating the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like the New Year.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater and we fire the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine.
You know the barbarie, it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources.
They won't be able to develop themselves in a dignity way, that's why people learn how to cooperate.
(Laughter) Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation, I give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not competence, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
Well, soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another, but we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players together with all the thermal body behind.
Our body is a pluricellular organism.
That is to say, where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we do.
Paradoxically, nature is the best humanitarian model to perfect for reaching sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is missing in time has suffered catastrophs of meteorites and constant processes of linear thinking.
Doctrine is political, like anarchism that failed communism, which also failed socialism, failed and capitalism, also failed.
A study by Oxfan last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That is, that they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that it takes care, because it advances nature to obtain economic benefit.
We have sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
That is, money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
It's bio, life, my great imitation, life imitation, but it's not new, this is already what the original peoples, indigenous people have been doing for thousands of years, and it's something that's inside all of us, we all have that college.
And I invite you.
Let's do a game.
It's an imagination.
What happens to this wire?
Or how could engineers, architects?
The economists, let's be inspired.
But well, it occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to their peak?
From the birds, Martín Bolador.
Well, the Japanese made the Bach train.
And with this bat?
We could make a trunk.
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
Could we build bioclimatic buildings?
And with this turning on its own.
Or a plant of solar panels.
As we know, there are millions of species.
Therefore, in nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP.
What does PIB mean, many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build?
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Imagine?
I would like you to give me a future dialog with your children and grandchildren.
At least you tried it, you fights.
AD: And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Laughter) And what I want to say is that the fourth of our opportunity and cover my mind.
They're laughing things.
The speaker we're not going to do everything we need.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, lying.
We're already bad, socially with good, we engage with our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do with the aspect, and not about why you think it's an opportunity to take advantage of it and we're not leaving something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do I say that?
Well, life isn't about anything else, that horrible moments and they learn about them, we learn the pain of the disease.
We've always done it and we're going to happen by doing, we learn from war, of death, so that's what we're going to be now.
And I think I'm not only bringing it.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
And then he decides when he was diagnosed with H.V, which is called modern nature, the cinema "estrexharmon," are the newspapers that call "chebo" in the 80s, to return to his passion from childhood to kindergarten, "mox gallery," which, in fact, after his diagnosis, are a lot of very important movies, some of his career.
And what was impressive, as a person, writes you.
For him, taking care of a kindergarten wasn't going to be time, it wasn't going through time.
Not like now that we spend the while cooking towards the bread.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And then they thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is the one that put new things in the world, we can say, if a father or a slap doesn't matter, and this reproductive work, which is between reproducing the conditions so that we can do that, clean, cook, care, right?
Basically, you can cook to the workers so that the next day you put the factory, your reproductive work, and the seed for a long time.
Aluming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
A: Now, why is the edge of zero in that relative value first of all we don't think of an absolute value?
And even more, why don't we do it as Dinzuderex Hermann and think that this difference is contrasted between productive and reproductive work is a rather fictional difference given by one side?
And also due to modernity, and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject of the gorginel, which uses the bone in the world in which the subject that sets, to take care of it, these are productive values to decenalize by the speakers and reproductive, on the contrary, women are important, it's something we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, it even says care tasks, are the most important ones, if today we are living without advertisers, without writers?
In a lot of things, I was moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food and without care.
And without illness and health, the only thing that is allowed us today is to eat and cure and clean.
And without that, the world?
AC: Antônio.
A: Are these tasks?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, what?
Not just a mechanical thing that we have to go above, not just see food, not just see food, it can think like that, we have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Ayarman is that...
Are we able to live them differently? Can we live them as tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which we also?
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modern nature, modernity, not as the human being separated from the natural world, that only does something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also interesting, regarding care relationship with our bodies, we think we have to take care of our bodies, gym, we have to cook, only to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
Right?
And that is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
And I think...
Well, this is not an opportunity.
And, of course, I want to go back to my life, no, the world doesn't need more soap operas and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
We all live now in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
Since the world needs more soap operas, I thought, "Well."
Why not, instead of being obsessed with keep being productive in these days and getting to know all schools and all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in another way, from that?
That's why, when I was invited to do this passive thing that didn't seem to me that I didn't want to have an intention of an original idea, the world hadn't been that the soap opera and that the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write what I had with my books and maybe I'd tell other people, right?
More than writing it, huh?
(Laughter) What else to do?
Be careful.
PK: When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
The name is Pan.
It's the most sweet, not more posters.
You spend every 15 days.
Has it happened?
It's an end of the middle.
These foods don't get fat.
QD: What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them.
But today I want to name you.
Three key aspects to have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
AC: One time, a teacher told me: "Onstage of secondary awareness to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take awareness is high to our desires...
And we would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
DB: On the contrary, the one who doesn't judge the most.
And after that, we are aware of what we are eating, what we are eating.
And in which amount?
QD: A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, it's not hungry.
The hunger of everything is hunger and hunger.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
B, dream, hug, an escape with double cheese.
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really able to say pizza?
Thank you, I prefer a needle.
Impossible, huh?
The second aspect is practice.
Do we eat it?
It's like every process in life.
You learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
That my include represents itself.
We must learn to eat in this station what this means, to eat the food that was costed at that time.
This allows us to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and thus enhance our health.
A: Because foods surrounded by their own times.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time, that is, they are not addressed with calories.
And necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruit all year long, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee us a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony to eat always the humble.
The last aspect?
That for me it's one.
Well, it's not less, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
To those who don't break.
Because they are not hungry, because they don't have time, because they often give Ausias.
And I have a question.
In other words, they also give them auses.
Repeting the plate of matches with a tape.
To think, right?
PK: So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
Because hunger is not affordable if they stay comed, if they eat.
And what wasn't consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night, and in double split.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
increasingly bigger, increasingly increasingly increasingly stronger.
So, if we don't stop.
Each three.
Four hours.
Well, to take a break.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unleash the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the cheaper jokes, I'm going to lose and not.
The most expert body becomes in reserve, in storing.
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, all we want to eliminate from our block.
PK: The food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave for favor of ignorance.
Food can hurt you or can cure you.
It depends on us, about taking awareness, what are we feeding and in what amount?
So I go back.
And it's the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation.
It should exist a coma with moderation.
That such food stimulates overweight.
To give a closure?
I propose you to eat rich.
I'm going to eat everything you like.
To eat various, but always take care of the portion.
(Pre-recorded voice) There's no reason the phrase of "Sayuna como rey," "Força como prince and dinner as a begging."
I think many people know it.
(Video) health doesn't have excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have that."
That's where hunger or worse happened.
Sometimes I died of her.
We have four opportunities every day.
To choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthily.
Thank you very much.
What am I obsessed with telling stories of female scientists?
So I love it, the first one that was obvious to me, Marie Curie, they didn't give a Nobel Prize, they gave them two.
So it deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things.
And I recently learned about Eugenia's story to be a dote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
They made great contributions.
Among them, the most important thing was that the vaccine went against polio in the 50s thanks to her.
Sometimes thousands of lives were saved.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And do you know what?
In 2011, I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
How I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that that made me find out of them very recently, very much anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were.
Well, but above all.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
The kids?
They keep losing a lot of time at school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Oh, yes!
Is there a new ortography?
And I think so.
What does it need or better?
And I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question nor the answer are new in our language.
But they come rooting from the century in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
An Antonio of Nebrijas went into our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
So we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound had to correspond a letter.
Each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound.
No, they had to get rid of it.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, that says we have to write.
According to say, it's and it's not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because the Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, has always had a strong resistance to write too different.
It seems like we say it, but it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we would uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided us.
And a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was the etymological one who says that we have to write, according to words, they wrote in their original language, Latin, Greek, and so we stay with them, that sometimes are aspers as in a cat, so we stay with them, fairies, and poths.
Three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
QD: I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience, we all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that plastic and child brain time, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules, full, however, of exception.
We were transmitted in many forms, implications and explanations.
And the idea that spelling was something fundamental.
One of our training.
However, I have the feeling.
Through the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
Antography is used to uniform writing, so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example, in ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved in puntuation.
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm.
What I'm writing with ortography isn't, with ortography or it's good or bad, depending on the current norms.
But then, wouldn't it make sense to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
So that all that time we dedicate to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, do deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to abolish.
Because orthography is not like that.
And each one writes however they want.
Sign language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental.
That those common criteria are the simplest ones you can.
Of course not?
And we classify our orthography.
But we are not leveling downward, when ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel at all.
It was the quality of language.
Chorus.
I work every day with the literature to say it as an orologist, frightening it, snakes, gongora, what do I see?
That sometimes they write "men."
However, sometimes they write "to write with scholarship."
And it is absolutely clear to me that the difference between that.
And these and ours?
It's of convention or lack of convention still at the time of them.
I mean, but not in quality.
But let me come back.
They are for the teachers.
What's key in this story?
I mentioned that insistence a bit irreflexive.
The teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is there are things like the United States.
That makes sense.
In our society?
An ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the blame of fruit.
To educate the ignorant, regardless.
Anyone of the content?
From what you're writing, you can be able or stop achieving a job by a H, who put or stopped putting on.
You can become an object of public mockery.
Why once?
Pictured.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers.
Or individuals related to teaching the first letters.
Those who promoted ortographic reforms.
Those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the biggest ortographic reform that had indeed the place.
It was in the Spanish language, the one in Chile, in the middle.
In the 19th century.
Why then?
No, not take the postcard.
Of those teachers?
And start.
I'm going to move forward in our ortography.
In other words, in the intimacy of us the 10,000 ones I would like to put on the table some modifications that I think are reasonable to start discussing.
Let's celebrate the Hemula.
It was then that we wrote a House.
(Laughter) But we don't say anything.
And we don't write anything.
(Laughter) It's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone.
All the shocks?
That causes us HMUDA.
Velarga and kiss, we said before.
Well, they never differentiated in Spanish language, we choose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one has their preferences, each one can argue.
Let's not stay.
Now let's eliminate the other.
"Hejota," let's divide the functions, that people burn sound soft, cats, thin, thin, thin, and that the joking retains the sound "asperó."
Jarabe.
Girafa, people.
It's Argentinian.
That's it!
That one, Iceta, is an interesting case.
Because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide.
But it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases the differences of pronouncing must be attended, now I said before: "She are comic".
In some places correspond to a sound, in two to two, and in three letters, we lower two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic.
But they are not that much.
And the Spanish Academy Real Academy, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified.
That the language.
It's linked to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool for everyday use, and that sometimes this attachment to history, traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
And for today's use.
That explains, in fact.
I think our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically.
Right?
How was it historically modified, for example?
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater, to theater, we were of quantity, we were of symbol, of symbol.
And little by little, now.
And some roofs start to be removed in the dictionary of the Academic Real.
Armony can write with H or H.
And we're all fine.
And it also seems to me.
What is this a moment?
Especially appropriated to deal with this discussion.
We always say that language changes.
And it's spontaneously from above.
That are users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
and that authority in some places.
A gym in other places is a dictionary, in other places, it's a ministry.
So, a long time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the level of words.
But it's less true.
For the gramatic level, and almost I would say it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above.
There were always the institutions that focused on the norms.
And they proposed modification.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Well, until today.
Literature always had a much more restricted and private use than speaking.
(Laughter) But at that time, the time of social media.
And that is suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now, never so many wrote in the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time.
And we are looking at a large scale.
They were ortographic and innovative uses.
Even people with impecable ortography, hyper-educated, when they write social networks.
It is quite similar to how they behave.
Most users of social networks is to say.
They represent the ortographic correction and priorize it.
I had speed and efficiency in communication.
For now, there.
Copic abuses.
Incredible.
But I think we have to pay attention to it.
Because they're probably telling us that a time that is assigned to writing to a new place.
You are asking for that writing.
New criteries.
I think we'd do it wrong.
Not to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, no, I think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them.
This within a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, as well.
No, we should learn.
Latin, Greek, Arabic.
And with a simplified ortography?
Let's recover etymology at the same place where we are now.
Or étymological dictatorships.
It's a second served objection of those who say.
If we simplify spelling, we'll stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter.
Well, that's true.
But it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring.
The huge one.
Because most cases, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
Comprensible, even the most conmovedor, which is what they say.
I don't want to change.
I educated myself like this, I got used to it this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortography, my eyes hurt.
(Video) That objection is part of each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases?
That is, changes are made ahead, children are taught new rules.
Or those we don't want, let us write how we are used to.
And it is expected that time feels.
That are the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform.
to touch such angry habits.
BB: The consensus is in favor, the level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past?
Is it to improve?
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree.
And cleaning our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them.
Although they don't serve us.
And I'm convinced.
What do we do with that?
Today, in the modest field.
But importantly of language.
Are we going to be letting them go to the next generations?
I made a future.
It wasn't better.
But before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris.
And say to myself, "Me too."
Well, I didn't hide from that eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and love.
Well, maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry.
And I felt the need to look at their ashes at the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
In other words, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became a father.
This image.
Well, you see it.
And that's the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And there's another one.
It's the brother of another else, and that's how I could teach you infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this taught me that our most pure material essence.
Well, we are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror.
There's perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
Thank you!
In Argentina.
It hit me.
This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is easy.
Because their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
AC: We shouldn't create an INBAP for education.
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
And I worked with schools.
It's to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers.
Doctors, many of you.
Why should this be blind of short-term political logic?
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
It's a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
And it's thinking of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, changes in education.
That is, they won't benefit the highest.
(Applause) Today, I'm not the scientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From bigamorphoses, extraterrestrial invasions, even pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home, we stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition, even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
Well, for example, worldwide obsession could buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Well, it has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than the answer.
It's a bit like the soccer player who runs desperately a ball to whom she actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, Chinese Government, in just 10 days.
Not only had he found the virus that produced the disease, but he had sequenced his genome and made it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology, called "the optimist blind."
Thinking that in reality, nothing will happen to us.
It made the major politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but more moral or social.
But why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unfortunate or stigmas, for example, in the bobonic fishing, they refused to Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, with the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to avoid people who are already ill with each other.
However, in Japan, everyone falls down.
This first makes people sick and not contagiate and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you only use more caregivers, you know who's sick and who isn't for if you wear or not more affection.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the estimation and this.
And take care of us all.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our ways, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we really lack is motivation to do something, and yet, in three days, all children are educated at home.
But we don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the premature need and the world keeps going.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with acusatory eyes.
By their predisposition to restring individual liberties, to confin people in their own.
Today what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to do a small mental experiment, a dilemma, a caricature so we can think about the future?
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of paying attention.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization, but also to govern ourselves and other public sectors has the capacity through some technology, to know where we are, where we are, to whom we find and also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our fold load, and can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of infecting and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this cost can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
Those who are children and stay home, those who are not at risk can come out.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of epidemic, completely disappears, but less people die and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we see it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons, why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that they were a bad use of them.
It's still true, there's nothing in free.
The question is: if you had the beginning of the pandemic, and could you choose if you feel good or bad?
What would you do?
Well, I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
Maybe, to give up our data in a bit like vaccinating us.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms, as part of a social pact, to take care of us.
And everything.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case with sexual freedom, we find a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free?
And be careful.
Will they fly less too is a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves, if we are OK to take part of our work as a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home.
We have an opportunity to think more freely than ever, what do we want it to be the conservative sex of coronavir?
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagona and Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
Well, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It was an animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples."
They are relatives of sea wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment ...
And I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossil that I didn't know.
Very fragile.
The sea dollar was broken, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
PK: But...
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me and taking me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet, around 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is nowadays, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but also...
The whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
What is a number we paleontologists?
That's what we mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000 for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That doesn't enter home.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well.
Life has made me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I haven't traveled.
Well, successes and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to figure out how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, South of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
We naturally think of these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a wonderful and full of fossils.
What are left to be discovered?
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the creptic period.
This is already about 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common meatm belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while for that time, in the northern hemisphere.
They added other families of carnivores, like, for example, accidents.
A: Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the hemisphere not.
But what happened before this stage we know well, what we call the legal period about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
The Mantoklaves, especially 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs, for the first time, completely dominated the planet, for the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the herbivorous niches in everything.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships, to explore the rocks of the Patagonia's Law.
And that leads me.
To one of the stories.
So, in the discoveries we were able to do.
It's the last blood.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking a very hot afternoon.
And after walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
He saw him becoming more clearly what he was.
It was the trail of a dinosaur.
I approached, stood next to me, shooled, I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and the Bellos knew it was, after studying years, bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the trash part was.
It was from a meat dinosaur now.
But really?
But I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
And after warning the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it.
After several days, we managed to cover it with bones' layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
And until the next season the winter came.
It was a year, long, waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
And to see if there was something else, it was only the skate we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
More than the station.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way.
That's it.
And that's where the excavation really begins: to throw it away, layer, those sediments that were burning.
Where we'd open up is a very exciting moment, it's for the first time that an animal is returning to the surface.
I was living in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The cinema had to have died, it had to be covered by sedentary layers, that kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and that food was transformed into sedentary rocks.
In that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Afterwards, all that buried rocket had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a warming of this whole block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosion.
Great!
That's it, until I started discovering.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those mistakes.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering the judges is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The pathologic wind, that doesn't lose.
But then, we were able to carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the museum lab, another extremely long stage starts, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor.
Of the birds, of those carnivores of the South Hemisphere, and this discovery showed us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
And that's what they thought.
Much before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate themselves, being due to a big ocean, the time of fire, when all continents were united in a supercontinent supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transported to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside us and after nine months of work in the lab we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those role blocks.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
Let's see, teeth in hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
For this dinosaur is also very special.
It's for something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur, a very, very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this meth of a dinosaur didn't look like any other way.
We contract or knew about the northern hemisphere.
Studying their remains we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times, and this was not so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other in this period of Pangea, the Atlantic ocean was still not formed today to these two continents.
But once again, we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Ridering the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that was possibly the existence of a certain one.
Or in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
Well, it was a great fact what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve.
independent and completely separated from the faines of the northern hemisphere.
It was the lack of water, what had isolated these slums, it wasn't a full of water desert.
And when we really think about dinosaurs.
And we find fascinating things that have their anatomy.
And we are going to really content fantastic, fansifascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this is the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Dreams in rocks.
They were formulated for millions of years.
It's our planet.
Extracting.
Every time.
The animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
And life.
I listen to a prepondering place.
In this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages still to read this book.
What if we really want?
To know our planet.
Cystems, ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays.
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Audience: Yes!
But it's also key.
To project a future.
Of us?
When I was a child I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dreamed of healing and having magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible and invasive.
Then, time.
It gives us a real bathroom.
You lost the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
You see empires invading small villages and you don't have the position of patterns to defend them, but something of that childhood vocation remained in me and almost without realizing it.
All my life was dedicated to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination, but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers, maybe.
The most important thing in this situation, which is the superpower to think better.
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea I'm going to tell you about.
That we are able to learn and that our ability to think is not given nor fixed, but can be developed.
Pooling our mind with it.
Power and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others.
"People, think better."
Well, first, imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That those on the floor, fathers, fixed bikes, turn around.
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
Five is to think.
We have to practice, think.
They develop us the habit of thinking and give time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
And it makes you one.
And does the saying say?
The one who only sees a hammer, now who only has a hammer sees all the problems as a slave.
But if we have to remove a torn, a hammer is useless.
And not to take into account of his slave.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a brain.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models.
If we only have a mental model, we'll think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get a torn with a human being.
Well, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where are those mental models, where do they get them from?
And when you find yourself in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, mental psychology, and there are also different models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
There are mental models in the old Egypt three,000 years ago before Christ.
In other words, in the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
But if not, all the problems will show us a slap.
It's the third one.
Recently, he was at the club and at the table next to him, who had told him about his son's soccer teacher, a man told his friends: "Ahead of his son and his classmates."
For a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
There's the Sun.
But it didn't realize.
(Laughter) Why?
Or by saying this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In his child.
I was leaving him like a bone in front of his friends and he was detegitating the teacher.
To the front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example, winning money and losing freedom, or winning freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale it impacts.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act?
And the beginning taught us that the essentials invisible the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, now in the pandemic, many data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions and they didn't make us act.
When they began to come images of Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those pressions generated emotion, fear, and fear generates action, that we are all stored preventively what is very good.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone like us happened before.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
And the practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Caster is something, you're hungry."
You fail?
You have an immediate reward of eating what to get married.
But very different farms do the effort now for something you'll take advantage of within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
To prevent us, it creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a seller, but except lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel, that is, develop our ability to anticipate, is one of the main skills of thinking well.
And let's think of a million.
What do we have to anticipate?
And now?
That we still feel, we don't see.
Of whom?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted, if we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of the boat, a high schoolmate that you wouldn't do 15 years.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
Finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But, as we know so many people.
And that is very likely.
Finding someone in a very unlikely place, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same, there are so many unbelievable things that are very likely that something happens to us.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future, we don't know what will happen.
And not now, my field with more normal times.
But we have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
And there will always leave many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
There are no serious things.
Although they are very probable.
And if someone ever asks you, why do you always have a car with Nasta tank full?
Contestals, why once?
You found yourself in a village next to the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I thought about zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being thirsty.
To the facts of ideas that make us change the way we think and people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
Or power of people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
In a Borques interview 40 years ago, the interview asked me a question, and when Borges replied.
The interviewee told me, "That's what you answered to me."
This same question four years ago.
Borphes, I don't know what has fallen.
He looked at him and said: "I apologize, it hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be in account of new ideas.
Of the new ideas that are emerging and always being open.
Let's change.
Our way of acting.
Women are irrational beings.
They were always given to emotional sport.
But that's why they need the cost of a male, the rational of the family.
At the beginning of your lives?
They will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
From a manual?
For the education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
(Laughter) In 2015 that means today, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
In 1910 Marie Curie.
And he won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of us here had already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, we're celebrating that.
But she let a woman be the master's.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
Well, that was it.
This idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
And he helps his husband.
which is a irrational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, women believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them, removing 5000, maybe, they believed that this idea was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the amazing transformation mass in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've experienced, if this is true.
To the idea that truth is a lie, there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem: now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody.
In other words, not the main world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that it doesn't exist in facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we've convinced it's on September 24th, because all we're here agreed with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreu, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more they exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every goal we put is part of a very hard social construction that we have automated and naturalized, cats live without a calendar.
My dog appreciates the hot and the one at this moment is alone at home.
S: No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I knew it, which time had come back.
But he doesn't look at the clock.
But if human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, he looked at a sleeper.
He wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But that's not how ideas arise.
And ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels had passed, to know the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
To discover the investigations that were accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The wisdom, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born, but if it was born in the 19th century.
And the same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now.
What we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation.
They are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political, and social field.
It was the revolutionary change, as we have seen, for thousands of years, women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
And in less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
Half of the scientists today in the world are women. Half of the university professors are women. Look all the creative energy that was lost to humanity to think of the way women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can do.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that model was created to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, "But how, the Greeks, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things."
In other words, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you today, have always existed in every culture, at all times.
That is, they are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But it had never been thought that the sexuality of a person.
Not bad, as it was called at that time.
So, he determined how a person was totally, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Vitoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it proibdes to something we want to do.
DB: Don't masturbate.
(Laughter) You'll do it guilty, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to be guilty.
It's not true, fault is a huge social control.
Why?
Don't you say?
The woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it.
Isn't it?
And then, that is a terrible social control form because it dominates us.
Well, incredibly!
On the one hand, do you know we can't leave, it's as if they deprived us of eating?
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong, the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world.
They don't have the right to talk, nor the right to stand up, the same as women before.
(Laughter) Or I judge it.
Or that blacks, without salt from slavery, don't even speak when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of sexual friends, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the Jews' situation, in some of the situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
Which 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood. This has just been raised now, in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
To be exhausted.
But in many parts of the world today they are completely legal. This was possible for the paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed ones.
Spread your identity.
They respect each other and then make others understand that they're also human beings with a full right, but there's a drama of social struggles and that one has to get into jail that discriminated me.
(Laughter) To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To be respected as a woman, I have to be just a woman, so that they respect me as black, just black, and the same thing as gay, the gay, the women, the Jews, the blacks, the white, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people.
In other words, I don't want to cost as a guy, what do I know?
However, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
through jails.
50 years ago.
Look how old sun is.
I was a homosexual boy.
I didn't know what it was to be a homosexual child, it's more.
I didn't know the word homosexual and they didn't even say to me like this: "My schoolmate told me, "Sure, we're going to screw you up."
"Sure, don't look at me."
And I didn't even know what it was to be a trophy, nor fathorn, or homosexual, or anything.
At the same time I knew that this caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was.
And I returned home, from school, and I saw my father loved it.
He looked at me.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so bad for it to come out like this?
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual.
So I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
Have a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person, saying that I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea that was having.
Or that it arises from understanding that there are no facts that exist.
interpretations.
(Applause) There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's what we are contradictory.
There are no facts, there are contradictions, and contradictions are also interpretations.
There are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume staying there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said.
And when I face it, because when an idea is incarcerated, it doesn't move, while we have it alone in our heads it doesn't serve us, it says body.
I left prison and left my prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison it is?
Oh, or they told me.
That there is a list of things we need to survive, called "the basic drop".
In other words, it's a rare idea, to live constantly with this rough, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
That is, it contains the things we need to survive.
What if it had the things we need to explore?
But exploring is something difficult, terrifying.
Each personal and place are completely different: the constant movement leads us extraordinary situations.
It's a moment.
Largo or little, full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
When everything I did is erased by someone else's voices, you, I'm not in a microphone, that splits the intensity of your ideas and besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, but once you say it, once you can take your words, you take an avalanche and ideas that live towards you at all speed.
Every moment is a combination of energy, of following, of returning to the spring, shooting or running.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not quite bad, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, the movements believed them.
Designs that take us to moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
VR: Happy.
That is, they keep themselves in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook.
Remember that maybe it's not like that.
It's a work of art, but they will allow you to review the exact way in which those stars were seen.
The formula I saw that face when I spoke about what I liked the most, the speed was the one that went to your heart.
Or how did you break when you spoke about that voice, that voice that you know so much, that knows that you're probably looking for something that you lost?
DB: That voice.
Your best friend, you're always there.
So, the first one to stand up, the first one to give you a little puzzle to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple ofaguas, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, if it's not a moviemaker, I can't survive.
What we grew up in girls cities.
I'm sure.
Well, every time we choose.
I don't mean the opportunity to get out.
Great, nothing to be!
I didn't manage a stable job either, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
It's me.
There it always appears on stage.
A person you'll see has already been in years.
Canoza and with a belly, wakes up her experience, but Federely.
They come to remind us that the past was better.
Is this really the case?
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
To think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of the whole life.
And Juancho, Franco and Emanuel.
(Laughter) These photos you're seeing there.
And it's from 2009 when I live in high school.
What can I say to my friends, that I really love them, that they are like my brothers?
And they are three disabled people.
that, as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to study what they liked, they stayed here in the city.
And be surprised, until today.
They can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
As for me, as I am the port in this photo, the mark of the absence of opportunities also became present, my folks, who are workers, made an effort on human beings so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew I didn't know if they stayed here in the city.
I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be with all opportunities.
Well, maybe some of you wondered why are these things happening?
(Pre-recorded voice) Divinjos in the middle of the 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress are at a speed that all surprise us and collapse the borders and barriers that insist on people.
And in this context?
And the cities to make more and more important tales.
Let's be honest, it's our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that, in 2050, 68% of the world population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more and more people choose to live in cities.
And it means that this is where we have a greater chance to progress.
What does it explain in two schemes while the weapons seem to stay in time?
Others make progress, they're vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that they want them to keep the cow when they come out today for that door to return home.
Strategy!
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
But part of my concern, as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens exactly for this.
To connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
(Laughter) Not in an indiscriminate way, but sitting down our strengths, our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have are our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) Now you may ask me: How do you see all this beautiful thing I'm telling you in real life?
Through complete projects.
That improves the quality of life of the population and avoid migration towards other places in search of a better future.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, so you can see a couple of things, you can first see drinks something like that.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of investment relationship is given.
As it improves the quality of the photos of the phones.
No, what we were in it, we were going to improve.
Some have a couple of more tips, others have to wait for them, but do you know what we share until today, beyond the deep hacker, we have some for the others?
(Laughter) The mark of the lack of opportunity.
Franco, for example, who is also the one of them in this photo.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2012.
He was a national champion.
(Laughter) But today, even if you want to detect a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday students working to be able to live.
(Laughter) Then you get somewhat, believe the one on my left, the strongest, that just then was his birthday.
(Laughter) How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces in the best country?
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, then, changing this network, without being able to find what he gives his passion and I cannot find a job that allows him to some economic independence.
(Laughter) Finally, it's Manuel, a genius of frustration, but they don't know the genius, they arrange anything.
No, but they tell them.
Everything, every day working in his place that built from nothing itself.
He goes to university to study programming and cannot develop his potential and continue learning what he likes.
Because it doesn't count all the necessary tools for the lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
Why?
(Laughter) We, young people, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
That's it!
Recently, I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a selected group of eight young worldwideedes, I left Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian for that event to participate in a week in New Delhi, the capital of India.
The thing is to say it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot, but if there are two things I'd like to share with you, they are accidents.
In the middle?
There are millions of opportunities out there, but there are millions of opportunities for all tastes and villages.
Great!
You have to be discouraged to find them, the sun doesn't come.
And in one of the two.
(Laughter) But not less important, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I have nothing to forget about the youth, nor the Chinese, nor anyone.
But do you know what differences are that we don't have to have?
And a state that is there to come out to the world and bring opportunities to them to act to develop.
AC: Once again.
If we want better cities, we know the world strategically.
I don't remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, I found myself to go to study.
And with three days to turn 18.
They were me, very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city playing.
(Laughter) It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
And until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Why is this?
I don't have to go to taste.
And my friends?
Not in anyone you know.
No, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
By the end, who's the most beautiful?
And let's take alas to the city that they were going to do you.
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco.
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Why?
If today they were in one of the security forces in our country.
Or to not go so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to keep adding what he likes.
That's it?
Thank you!
Like that!
We don't see the lack of opportunity.
Yes!
No, all this.
What am I telling you?
It doesn't seem to be enough argument.
Do you want another example?
That's fine.
DB: This is it!
And it's the tattoo.
And she says: "When finally?"
I could overcome the deep clinical depression.
Not in which I fell, not having any difference.
Don't you think it's
DB: Two suicide attempts.
(Laughter) Sumerable, psychological sequels.
It took me.
Many, many well-known people.
If we want these things to stop passing.
But we have to go out strategically too.
In the sun!
But we don't eat a final point in our city.
I'm a surgeon.
Since always, the surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in the last 10 years.
It was my research.
In my case, in the sofa, it was based on searching.
Let's see the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
And that?
We can do it in many ways, for example, looking for genes to detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
Can we?
Or help the tissues to repair by themselves.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
DB: This!
We do it with biological platforms, which are like a map.
What do we give them?
Not to the tissue.
To use their own ability.
But we have to restore after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate this task.
DB: What happened before.
It seemed like science fiction, today is almost daily, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction, to me.
And a lot of patients that prevented.
Not having to become a surgery.
Well, with all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
I have more and more back.
I'd like to share a reflection.
It's about what can mean a collective culture at a moment like this.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese, and in my work for many years I've had contact with questions.
There are sociological and anthropological literary of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to ask us a first question.
Why, Japan?
He could avoid the biggest impact of the contagium.
If it was in January, the first case happened.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
Moving from the population of the third age in the world.
Going back to the second country with more smokers.
For the number of inhabitants.
Why in Japan the infection of this virus?
It has not had an exponential growth.
but a linear advance and identified one.
Until now.
But we know that this new virus chron is very contagious.
In these demographic data, Japan presents us a cocotte.
What would allow a great propagation of the disease?
Many people in little place and a quarter of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in a way.
It answers organicly and united to any event that compromises her.
Japan went through war.
Picks, their name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 earthquakes per day.
Generation, transgenation.
He had to overlleve natural disasters.
It is generated by man.
We can think of this with something that really likes Argentines.
There are football teams for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure and has to go out to improvise.
And the directives.
Social and hygiene and individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or in its own home.
The Japanese population has not established, it's been hundreds of years ago.
You don't need to say no to embrace yourself, not to give a kiss.
Because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
We don't have to indicate not to sweat or stubborn on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50 percent of Japanese ...
You will use board when you feel cold.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good at all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They did two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
You'll surely know the game of the chair.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get one out of each round.
This experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves is in this way of being.
Well, it's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me.
In resonance, allow us to perform when we take care of others.
There's a child in the example.
But we can already see how a collective society works.
If it helps itself.
Because every immigration contributes to the good of everyone.
