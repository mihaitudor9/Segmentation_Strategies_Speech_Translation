We are cheerers, we do it by Claudio Rentino with cellos, through instrument trajects of distant rocks and orchestra music, we filled them with the one that avoids the game.
But we had a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we are, the protagonists.
From our popular music, for this, we change the way to play it, so that it suits Joy Claude, and it can dance. Look at it quickly!
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires and I told you at the beginning that we had to learn to work.
So, it's called by video, each one wrapped their part.
That's how the other can play on them and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Why?
So no, not even the Marsouflans in the workshops.
(Pre-recorded voice) So I need it.
And relatives are those who don't recover.
What this time?
(Pre-recorded voice) The shows, right?
Well, they wake up to see a stance.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic, something that we dedicate to checking the contents of social networks and fighting misinformation, they were already seeing.
(Sigh) And not worry about this new idea.
During the pandemic, the flu.
In 2009, I already attended Twitter, risk and hat, but its consumption, global supertraction, was much lower.
The pandemic, COVII9 is the first pandemic that lives with my melted approach.
And what is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called "mother" because it creates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous, we know it, but when it comes to health issues, what can put in danger is our lives directly.
Or if you had an idea, there's no idea at all, and, of course, a WhatsApp on YouTube, Twitter, of the amount of waste that circulates the viralization of content to verify.
Four weeks ago with my team.
But we work.
Without resting, checking, tricks, truths that circulate over this new disease, false contents.
I know that we know and we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible, and sometimes they're frustrated.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
The COVID-19 COVID can fit.
Or classifying in four categories, I think telling them until then they will be more prepared.
And they are more prepared that they can help to stop this balance of information that can on us.
The four categories are simple: The first has to do with contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Intirative theories that say that if you see content, a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stole it to Canada, until an English lab created this virus, I didn't consider it serious, discard it, there is no evidence of zoo.
The second category relates to how the virus contagiates and some media published that we were going to contagiate only to open the window. This is not the case, a wrong reading in a scientific study, in a Pepper, that proved that the virus lives a few hours in the air, made millions of people respond, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to false treatments and jury, is the most dangerous, it has to be more attentive, the one that has to force us to be more careful.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us, there's no Cuban ground that managed to generate it. There's no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine. It's not true that there is already a vaccine taking hot water with lemon, we kill albums, and that making steam is drumble to disappear from our body if we are infected, but at the moment it doesn't have a fully satisfying response.
The fourth category of this information relates to false measures, not the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and obligatory social isolation was expelled, 15 days ago, a little more, a false of credit that said that the quarantine started at 3 in the afternoon, and obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others with whom you crossed that say it's going to fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world, and so it makes us fear, that not only we'll have to be locked up in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation in general try to generate panic and anxiety, that's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that comes from one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, like the World Health organization or the Health Ministry unfies.
Before finishing, I want to tell you something else we learned, those we dedicate ourselves, checking, checking.
Why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
We are not comfortable when we are missing to do thesis.
And then we move forward, we move forward to find that certainty without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, it's not cheated, you don't share it, we replace comparison with doubts, so common.
(Laughter)
I don't share my doubts.
And we take care of them.
If you receive a content.
I put streets, eaten, somebody, and I covered that I fail with signness and affection.
And if you share a content and then you realize that fake news don't street you.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not stupid, but alive.
While the dynamic pandemic tell us infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time, there are changes every day, science works intensely to get the cure and it needs time, there is a void of evidence and information.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era in which the answers and certainties that we needed as much as now, but I'm sure, because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we will be much worse than tolerating them.
Why?
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working is a means of pain, of other people.
It doesn't make you a person, bitter, sad, or sad. On the contrary, it teaches you to appreciate every moment of your existence and to be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, not as we wanted them to be, but to see a filagon in an act of reconciliation.
of sorry, of love or transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generates the close presence of death.
When despite having done everything possible, doctors have to work much more on our omnipotentia, to be more humble and not to feel frustrated, or we failed, the result is not what they expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times, it's good to see.
And there are many people.
That they are suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
Finally, I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, it's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate love and compassion, may tear.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Why?
Recently...
I was 40 years old.
(Laughter) After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more own, more personal topics.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why, when a man is introduced, is enough for him to say it?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman like me, I have to decide goodwar, I'm a writer.
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
AC: I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
QD: It was already written on many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately that half of humanity is manliness and the other half is feminity, so why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry, at 40.
I am enjoying it a lot, it's such an obvious topic, but at the same time so ignored.
AC: And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations different to a man.
You just have to walk in the street to see that humanity is divided into two groups that walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist on women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological?
Psicological, technological.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
That it doesn't happen, man is everything, in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women are the other, they are the other.
There are women.
FR: Second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
And it wasn't defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Excrued as blacks, excluded as Proletaries or Jews.
(Laughter) But among them there is a community, they say: "We identify ourselves."
However, women.
They don't identify themselves easily among them, they don't say us.
In fact, a white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white man than with a black woman.
It's a funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
That is, with a projectionary.
Women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live disperse within the group of men.
Anything.
Men is quite satisfied to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the antifeminists sought theories in religion, theology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In discussion, it's philosophical.
Several men usually ask me, "You owe this because you're a woman."
Of course, as if for having ovaries and uterus and rule and hormones I would take away any objectivity.
Well, as if they wrote their theories.
AC: They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
(Laughter) And inside everything I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
And I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Nature is that?
Society does not dictate, it's the culture that explains how we are interacting in our society.
Well, in other terms.
QD: You're not born a woman.
It's yoga to do it.
And I was quite privileged.
QD: When I published my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Well, therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds, it was a complete, integral individual.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
(Laughter) Get married.
Go back to Sclava de Suez POceau.
To have children, devote yourself to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
His feminity resembles to that.
AC: I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
It's conscious.
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
Well, with free will.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman and every man.
(Laughter) And they must decide what they want for their sexuality.
Above all that he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what you want to do at work if you want or not to work.
With free choice, free will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together between men and women what I want is to be aware of.
That when it's the second sex.
These questions will have answered and are living them.
So, we will live in a whole, powerful society.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
FR: Thank you, thank you.
(Laughter) To be honest, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the whole role, which is an hipno.
In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And in the end it says, and this slope these thoughts so that they give them value to their suffering.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
Also, right?
(Laughter) Breathe now, surely you're already breathing at home.
(Laughter) Because I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
Carrillo.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
A couple of years ago, a group of mine from my school went out to marry for the abortion legalization.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
(Laughter) I still remember his face when we arrived with me in Congreso.
Look around and he told me with a smile and a lot of surprise: "Wow, it's full of kids!
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, the same thing was understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that today is super natural to me: talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all there are villains that oppress, that discriminate against the rest, that say they are more.
And there are teenagers, children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like the one of those books.
And we have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in a terrifying distopy like that of climate change in which we, the youths, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where there's a death bag, there must be aarry, and of course, there's also a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it is present in all aspects of our lives, in the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in versions we choose to believe, in what we think is good or bad, for me, they have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
(Laughter) And while many people prefer to avoid these issues, to not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
But I can assure you there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone in their political position is not the same as fighting for me because I am in mouth and a kid's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
(Laughter) That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
And if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
Because he can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, "I hope that more and more we begin to see marks and political spaces in general, not as dangerous, something that scares, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and hopefully there is always, but there is always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly and say, without a little surprise, it's full of children, thank you very much.
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a cup like this to take water home?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted?
Was there this color?
But the world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life.
And if we wouldn't exist in it, in fact, human beings, we are composed of over 65% of water.
Despite that, every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the maintenance lakes, through the agriculture of our big companies and even our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not only about the appearance of diseases around the world, but also the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world, this means that if we selected 10 people randomly from anywhere on Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Well, of that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is somehow paradoxical, since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we rise a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries, almost 20 million people, that is, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
Well, these are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth is in front of this situation.
This question is exactly the one that made four zanagota doctors leave everything behind.
We wanted the bags and got together again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, Mexico.
Funding like this, you go to the project.
(Laughter) Let's do an autocaravan coast, so we call the Blanca window.
And, above all, we were charged with a tremendous desire to return to the world the luck that we have had, because we were born where we were born, we launched the abandonment.
During the way we were going to find them with rural communities and rural camps that rarely have water at home.
(Pre-recorded voice) All of them could go rounds or commandials.
To be able to see, but always with a common problem.
(Laughter) The water has this pinete.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat: the Pyram, crying or directly bought, which as you have, requires a huge cost of resources for people who practically don't have art.
Audience: Yes!
Men 3: money resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go pick up the sign and then go.
And we asked ourselves, "What can we do to help increase this problem?"
"Yes."
Through the basis that we were experts in the matter, we put them humans to the work, and after many weeks of research we found a system.
Understanding by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
And I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works almost like a color.
(Laughter) Stop spending only clean water, retaining in 99% of all these substances, contaminated water goes by the end, older than with a love molecule... (Laughter) The contaminated water goes by the end.
It's health.
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately.
(Video) Besides, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider that only the weight of water exists to make it work.
Can you imagine the impact of these filters in the lives of all these people?
A: Well, that's it.
We want to tell you a story: Leocruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he, and all his populate, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by ethical stages around him.
But, is our move?
And Leo signed up in an English course.
So, can't you imagine the illusion it made us and the pride it was to be able to see all those agents in those communities?
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
To fulfill, among other things, your dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well, we deliver 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people in Mexico or Atemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, have access to drinking water for around 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatel Vancroy came up with an idea, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
Now, we've never been alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign that was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together we have created a social movement.
What has made from the trip of these four friends an unstoppable caravan against the water crisis?
But there's still a lot, there's still a lot to do, millions of people still have no drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis can be one of the risks of the biggest risks in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
So, we started to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident, we have created many needs that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
What do you think, for example, that they're doing for those lands, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil?
So that all of us can fill our vehicles' depth.
They are making the communities have to get there, what they are doing is to pollutate, to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or or the Amazon rivers, we've been there, and it's amazing, and in the future, this will probably disappear to their culture.
But it's really incredible and living it hasn't left us.
It has left us something that has opened.
It's really something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
It's a reality that is not just one.
It's a reality that affects underwhelmed countries, the world crisis, the world crisis of November 2016.
And this is directly affecting us all and each one feels in this room.
But you don't need to go very far.
What happened in California?
That a technological development world is powering people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
VB: For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffer from drought, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the houses of water in the future.
But if we really want to make a change, if we really want to impact on this planet.
What we all have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what problems and necessities will really be sustainable.
Well, what we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
This small NGO that is trying to build forces in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the life that these big companies say, that, of course, they are not doing things right now.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck that we have to reach our homes.
Opening water shifts and always water goes out, or it's not like that.
JP: Please, let's get rid of this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to raise awareness and act and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
And so we won't be able to achieve the change we want to see in the world.
(Laughter) Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
Who has played, how beautiful it is for here?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making an commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources, and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency that generates our heart, our emotion.
So I'm going to ask a quick question, above all front lines, to put ourselves in a context: How is society today? Raise your hand and tell me, three or four answers, if you open your heart, surely you can receive 1% of what I'm going to say, if we stay trapped only in one part, so it's my commitment, and I see that emotion has a potential thousand times superior to the thought, stressed?
Revolved, confused, aggressive, facing it.
An accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities for me to give me this kind of answers, you gave the answers you just gave, and then to another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand if you are happy,
(Laughter) Those of you who cry happy, raise your hand.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
You who are, who we are, aren't the society.
When we talk about society that we refer to, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy, the answers that take sometimes we go to schools, we take the day to the kids' diary, and we tell them: look for good news, bad and neutral news, day money, not everything that's missing, everything that's wrong, everything that's wrong, everything that's wrong, lost, restorized, lied to the crisis, one, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this: soccer, basket, rugby, not good, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
When they ask me how you are perfectly fine, it's soon that 7th of July 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something is wrong, we complain about absolutely everything. What is the heat 3 of black 3 in the afternoon? What happened to you?
DB: You don't complain about anything!
So we have turned into a society that is an astrologist, it's like a title we have, we complain about everything, we have a second national sport that has to do with the claim.
Well, let's lose everything, I check it with my friends, there's a friend Fernando, who goes to the t-shirt with him and I tell him, "I recreate without batteries in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries, because it's the smell, you can put up the soy?"
You realize that the dollar is going down there, underground and you know, we leave everything, we opinate about economy, politics... and there are some worrying people, or, we have started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain, we claim, and we are immers in the opinion, what makes it fall into a sort of vital distancing.
You see that we leave our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also have a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy, we had it, we started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
In addition, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the ring, that wonderful day, and the ring says to me, "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, especially in our generation, that we have left ahead of society in moral crisis, that even in the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine, faced, breathed, but besides, we are making our children believe, and we don't make them believe this. How does this quote represent here, how we are the architects?
And what do you want to be in Argentina?
And we listen to this and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
We don't just leave this society as it is, but we also make ourselves believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
Let's see, right now.
For a long time, I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I became convinced that talent was important, I had to have talent, I had to have experience, and I became more and more engaged in this, I saw that all of them add, but the attitude multiplied, and all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies, that is a zero guy.
If you have that negative attitude, that's a negative type, if you have a pessimistic guy, you are a pessimist guy, and if you have a merde attitude, that's a sort of merdity.
So I started to say, well, how I'm going to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed, I had a decision to change the attitude, that I had everything that happened to me, and I started to say what I was going to do, sorry.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to live a different world, because living hell, this square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why it goes with a shirt that says: "I respect, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision, but I want to pass on time and stop worrying about education."
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing, if we're always waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started educating, I thought there's a lot of way to educate, for me alone, with the example, every time we do something, someone is watching us, starting from our square meter, to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I'm the one I want to change things. The main character is those people in change, they're not waiting for someone who reserved their life, and if you're with a pessimistic group or a pessimist, if you're with a group of failures, that makes you a kind of unhappy. If you start a square meter, for me, the important thing is not what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo on his side, he would give it, it doesn't matter what to be advertising, and I tell the girl: "Pelices Pascuas" and she says to me, "There were 300 people, and I the first one that made me happy is Pascua, he doesn't tell me, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter that emits, what do you fit?
Emite respect, I respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude, emits unconditional love, what you do, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you say, it's what you receive, this is like AME, if you are in AM and you go from one AM to the other side, you'll listen to that.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first match is playing against myself, well, I wake up, I don't get up, a wind with bad humour, or with good humor."
(Laughter) They are all decisions, they are all small differences: excellence, mediocreity, there's this difference, the path you take is a church since you wake up, your victims or protagonists, you're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come, or you'll be functional to the interests that today are governing us and taking us from domesticated nostrils, people take it for fear.
My father left me a huge heritage, she always told me, "Black and fear I've never had," well.
We work, no, let's be safer each time, and I'm going to share two life experiences with this Dalbis Foundation, Borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To discover what we did last week, we gathered veterans of Argentine and British war, a britannic sea bottle, a burk, and gathered with Argentine veterans and together they have a meeting message that nobody won, and they know who to close the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
A place where I act was of lack, I thought there were a lot of things missing, and I understood that all the time I was worried about what I lacked, and one morning I see a Palestine woman being the city of Belén, and hugging with other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration, so I say, what are they celebrating?
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, with drinking water at home every week.
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water and celebrate it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
I ask him: Do you know what the genius is in lamparadine, all through the translator, they told me, I have no idea?
So I'm going to explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me, everything excited and tells me.
"Oh, give me my hot water bathroom."
As its great desire, and at that time I was connected with what I was missing, I realized that since I was born I never had to think if I would have water to take, if I would be able to give my bathroom, if I would have where to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude, I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
The first step will have three steps in the exercise: I ask you to close your eyes to all, to close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never realize or we thank, like health, like the possibilities we have, like the fact of having the place to sleep, like our having water, to bathe our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room have been welcome or selected or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now, who express this gratitude.
Stop standing up, claping it stronger, that can shout at doing what you want, express the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life, if you feel it right now, from this moment, please stand up and applause as well.
(Applause) You can shout, you can plunge into the chair, you can do whatever you want.
We are in a society at a bended moment, very well, very above, very up, and this is the gratitude we have to express for everything we have.
(Applause) Barba, Barba, loist... Yes!
So, what did I get there?
Keep there for a moment.
The longest way to go?
There are four pads, when we manage to move from our heads, we connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we realize, when we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, all we have, but a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment and now I'm going to ask you to anchor at this moment what we just felt and this feeling and that each day of your life, when you are going to have a shower.
Do you remember that there is a place in a world of a 10-year-old boy to the genius of the gradual lamp?
And he asks what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much.
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others, and you don't need to be an instrumentist or be a musician to avoid music, you know why?
The sun comes out bad, my life.
But also the music in the pauses and being receptive, music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy.
Until we grow up and bring music with us, and it also creates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools to be able to go together and grow in community, so that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Welcome.
Very good!
(Laughter)
It's not easy to face this way in front of a sea of people.
[A.DE.]
Imagine then what bullying must be, bullying, those physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as school support.
(Laughter) One of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems. However, 5 or 10 years ago, I think a few or none of us had heard this word "bull".
Well, but I think this is nothing new, both children and teachers, fathers and general societies, were considered much more traditional of school humiliations, but not that serious, they could even think that they are the castings applied by an authority, as a teacher, or a principal, or at least it wasn't this word, but it's not exactly the same, it's not that long ago, but it's not exactly the same.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
A school humiliation moves, which are these castings that the same students apply among themselves for the most diverse reasons, but almost always for something related to physical and personality of the victim.
AC: Well, if this is actually happening, the question is: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change, about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, supporters, bad grades, what operates there is fault.
I bet for having done something wrong, something bad: guilt is an internal emotion, private, it refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one itself, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect.
I even feel guilty because I did something bad.
Now, in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion.
PK: embarrassment.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different, embarrassment is a public emotion.
And it doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong, something wrong.
So, in the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others, the others.
And the look of others that judges me in an incorrect way, unfair, sometimes cruel.
Beyond having fault or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that exercise my cruel look, so it's a transformation, and I believe this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because it seems to me that the alien look, the look of the other, which obviously was always important.
Lately, they won a demeasurable weight, perhaps, at the moment of judging who each one is, and how much it is.
And this hasn't always been like that, that's why I say it's a huge historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, which is not from now, which has been managing for decades, and it's finishing to consume now, it's crystalizing now, and I think it's one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
So, it's the abandonment of the idea of interiority.
That's why, well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us and designed it with Ident: Is the conviction that inner life existed, something essential?
Just as a set, an infinity, or the phenomenon of social networks could be an exception to conquer the greater number of followers or "me like" or, fault is no longer, as something more important, but let's think everywhere, but today, in the case of the villages, to plastic surgeries, but that are no longer the phenomenon of culto to the body, that was developed in the last decades, such as the soul or bullying, but that is inside the tattoos, but that is inside these transformations, in order to produce, but these social effects are not the case of the views, but they are not the deep ones, but magazines are not the magazines anymore, but they are not the magazines, but they are not the magazines,
And this, of course, is very complicated because it requires a leadership, an administration of two vertical issues that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, it's always the risk that this full look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance, also, that ignores us, and then, what we used to be private before, was to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the school walls or at home, suddenly, it's expected by people's ancestors, or everyone knows.
(Laughter) So it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
That's not good, an animal in itself, if all this is happening, in fact, this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do? Also, this is better or worse than before, it's good, bad, as we solve it, and well, the bad news is that I only have in account, but it's a fact.
(Laughter) Because if we keep thinking that things changed in fact, so if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far away, in that's what he wanted to say, thank you.
I received a few days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we would not forget about these days, and one of them told me.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
But a doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I'm thinking a lot about this.
How?
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think that yes, we're learning some important things, and I'd like to share three of those ideas that keep me spinning around these days and that hopefully, one of those are useful to keep thinking about the education of here, in front of us.
The first is that for the first time, all teachers together have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Education innovation is something close to what's been talking about, but that up to now occur in isolation by separation.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance and in this process we are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that we didn't need to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available, but that we had never had the urgency in periods in need to use.
You see tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
And these days they are, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we tried them, we use them, those strategies are already starting to do your own, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box, and little by little, and in the middle of the frustration it brings, we'll take the taste, to test new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system, today teachers and teachers of all kind are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons, even tissue workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, older people began to show how the compound was to make bank paperwork to people of their age.
And we are learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn, just like once and again.
(Laughter) And suddenly, today, for another, that's happening.
In these days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own times, others start with the subjects that are more interested, others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to finish to understand something that doesn't happen to them, or to learn about the new ones who wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on, because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy, of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working to the parade.
And he also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them, since very young, to organize tasks and everything that needs to learn to learn.
And my last reflection is rather a question.
What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
(Video ends) When boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks, I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's that never the differences between home, it's not just the one with a computer and the one with the Internet, the one with no.
He is the one who has a calm place to study, and the one who doesn't, the one who has here to ask and the one who doesn't.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home and those who don't.
The school, with all its difficulties, at least during only one leave, put those inequalities in parentsis and helps all boys and girls to be protected and with the opposite focus.
GB: And in the middle of time.
Well, as an educator I really care about how this will follow and I also ask myself what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is...
They saw when they get bad marks and they stay at the naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes, also on the beach, seem to be some treasures hidden.
I hope that even though, as my son said, this historical moment isn't for any good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not ways to teach, to rethink the use of time and ways to learn and also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
Today, physical works are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens, the education we dream of.
A: Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
that doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in their X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, that mythomans and Chinese people who learned how to be cyber-attacks, got involved in the spreading conspiranóid news through social media, shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for Rivery Soñé, I dreamed that the Church was also online, I dreamed that an algorithm supported lawyers and judges, and that from one day to the other, all those who ever had rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert and that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business, and we had a line in the street, automatically by taste, always keeping a meter and a half away with the next one.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we would help them from far away with the chest, I dreamed that soldiers who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized that they would quickly think of love in the neighborhood, and they started to live together because the same thing before, and that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
The government announced the end of the pandemic, and in a short communicative way, the president said to the town that it was possible to go out to the street, or that they had habits to something else, I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, they proliferated suddenly wildlife and lobos, or that they take care of their jobs, leave their homes.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9th of July, and then, upon leaving, I woke up, and that without wanting, and that we all went out as crazy in the street, and discovered the truck and we killed it, tons of wine cardboard, and there were shouts to make a selfie with the animal.
And I felt better.
It's not so that when you see a photo, sometimes there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly on the picture, or people who are a little nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't display it, take the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge to do with detachment, to indicate the etymology of gesture, the visual stimulation of what we are capturing and we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
And just like I did, I felt challenged and I decided to try it.
And if I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or unite with a cremma that remained in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram, I wrote a letter by chance and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful women in number 18.
And back there were a lot of people, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
Well, so I seemed like a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "This is it, until a girl likes art."
Something that later I confirmed with some photos in which she seemed to paint.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
So, what is a trans girl who inherited school last year and who is currently studying graphic design?
And among all that I could also see what a healthy person is, who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so he is very respectful with the environment.
(Laughter) But when these ten things had happened 28 seconds, my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could meet someone like that from social networks, it's true that in social media everyone chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken months to pass from a general idea of that person to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first meet the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person, understanding this way what I see in my first impression.
An example is, like with the girl I found on Instagram, I didn't judge her for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier for me to know her, or for her to choose to show no to her reality, on the contrary, finding myself with what I see on the other person helped me to question myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like when I talked about taking care of the environment, and there I started to ask myself what I am saying to take care of the planet, if I really want to take care of it, and if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and eating my very deserved me, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't search for a label to enhance it, I try to know it more in that first instance, I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask your user in social networks, thank you very much.
And I would like you to pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
And what parts of the face do you think you are looking?
And they can be aware of how their eyes move in this image, what they see first that they see later.
You surely have all happened at some point.
Two eyes, in different parts of the face, speak to be detained somewhere.
Effectively, some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci knew that pores and details were fundamental elements to create what we would call the look of a portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew which parts of the face were looking for.
The elaboration of a portrait is to highlight an subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada, and at the same time it is looking for the other, which is the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a team of positioning in a laboratory of neuroscience we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image in time to extract information, since the rest constitutes the brain, how our eyes select certain specific parts of that face, the portrait, and which not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others, we cultivate it, that's what I'm showing you and that I want to share with you.
This brief trial for the journey of an eye is the search for childhood, customs and languages, in which we travel with some maps of art and various leaves of the field of science, but that fundamentally we like to think in a way as a journey, in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
SV: At the exact moment we were born.
We start to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
Do we invest so many resources in living more and more years?
And even so.
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
"Nobody wants to be old."
Why?
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me: "What are you so young?"
(Pre-recorded voice) It's my future that answered to her: Who are you living for many years and I'll go there?
What they didn't say at that time, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this topic.
And it's fear.
Fear to be old.
DB: No!
Meet to live in a society where the most important thing is.
To be or to look young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
But lose value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted. Can we see them?
In publicities, in labor searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them, or we let them happen.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
When the data of the vetor of social debt tells us that 70 percent of the elderly people in Argentina are self-beatable, that is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief that the elderly are sad or depressed?
When 80 percent say being happy, and that's much more than what people in my age or even young.
Or this passive class label.
The passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
They are doing sports, taking part in volunteers, taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact on people's lives because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
And if I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
And in general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time it was about older people, they used the same photo.
It's!
From the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad media has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults, third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
DB: Great!
It's old.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everything.
(Pre-recorded voice) The only thing I suggest is to avoid a grandfather or grandmother.
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
Why affection some of them justify?
But it's because of affection.
I could say "my friend" because she's a woman in reproductive age and doesn't correspond.
The elderly have a name like everything.
And stereotypes?
And they hurt.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old, in 2050 they will see older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example, in this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment.
Why?
Or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
But, however.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Well, many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people?
In other words, to really understand what their new needs are, their new possibilities, desires and tastes are.
A while ago, when I interviewed an older person, one was clear to me if they wanted to be activities with people of their age or with younger people, and I asked them, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Why?
