Are we young?
We do their profile at the end of the City Hall.
Let's see, the instrument brought rocks.
And in music, in an orchestra, I filled it with it.
Audience: Yes!
We had a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we go, the protagonist.
Of our music, little.
For this, we change the way we play it, so it can sound like a folklore and go.
A million inhabitants and alive.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
How many deaf people had my carbon?
It's called by video, each one records their part.
That's how the other point falls over and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this evil.
I love what scares me.
B.G: That's really that.
No, it's a sick person.
And relatives are those who don't recover.
What are you seeing?
And the choices?
And they wake up to see them.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic.
Something that we dedicate to checking the content of social networks and fighting misinformation.
But we were already seeing.
And not worrying about this new idea.
But during the pandemic, it releases it.
Do you remember the coin?
There were already Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
No, but their consumption, global overesting, was much cheaper.
The pandemic, COVII9 is the first pandemic that lives with my melted approach.
What is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called it like Aterda.
Because it creates foreign panic and anxiety.
Disinformation is always dangerous, we know it.
But when it comes to health issues, it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can put in danger, is our lives directly.
We don't have an idea at all.
Of the amount of waste.
That they circulate these days on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they may not agree with a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of uncertained content.
In fact, four weeks ago.
How here?
We lower it.
without rest.
Checking.
I have fake news.
Dieters, truths that circulate on this new disease.
But do you know what we know?
And they are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information.
And it's impossible.
And sometimes it's fruit.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
Pinculated to COVID-19.
You can fit.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that counting cells until then will be more prepared.
And they are more prepared that they can help to stop this balance of information that can on us.
The four categories are simple: The first one has to do?
(Video) With content linked to the origin of the disease.
Comparative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them from Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
I had no instruction.
If you see content linked to a theory that human beings created this virus, don't take it seriously, discarded it, there is no sun evidence.
The second category relates to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Girls and jury are the most dangerous, it is the one that has to pay more attention.
To those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making us drinks with hot water and salt, or making vapor, it's virus to disappear from our body if we are infected, it's not true that the vaccine that will heal us.
But there is no Cuban flavor that managed to create it.
There is no Argentinian who has already discovered the saving vaccine, science works all the machine to find appropriate treatment and medications, but at the time it doesn't have a fully satisfied response.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures.
Or to take apart from different measures to the opposites of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social isolation was expelled, 15 days ago or a little more.
There was a failure of credit that said that quarantine started 3 pm. that day.
And, obviously, it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that not only we'll have to be locked in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation in general try to generate panic and anxiety.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health organization or the Ministry of Salud, unfies.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
And why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
But we are comfortable.
Well, when are we missing to do a thesis?
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, isn't it cheated?
Don't share it.
Let's replace comparison with doubts.
It's so common.
I don't share my doubts.
That is what we take care of them today.
If you receive a content.
A: Of someone.
And I discovered that they lack.
BB: My nightmare.
How did he turn around, confirmed salt and carefully?
And if you did share a content.
And then you realize.
What does it make there no box?
Disculpate and correct.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day, science works intensely to get the cure, but it needs time.
(Pre-recorded voice) While, there is a void of evidence and information.
Do we have to be capable?
Maybe like a before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era in which the answers were missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
If we fill those empty with blue content, because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we will be much worse than if they tolerate them.
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
And one of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working is a means of pain.
Well, from other people.
And it doesn't make you a person, bitter, or sad.
And the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle in an act.
reconciliation.
No, sorry.
Yes, of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a tool.
What empowering!
It allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear.
that generate the close presence of death.
I understood that doctors have to work much more on our omnipotenty, to be more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed when despite having done everything possible.
And the result is not what I expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours.
And that allows you to put it on.
Your own problem as perspective.
And finally I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
And above all.
It's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivate love and compassion.
Or they help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate.
Let's see, love and compassion.
And they can't lie down.
It's a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Recently...
I was 40 years old.
Well, after having written several novels.
I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition.
From my condition as a woman.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for desire?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman, like me.
I don't have to decide good night.
Am I a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves to say?
But I had a lot to start my research.
about women's condition.
QD: It was already written on many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
DB: But...
And in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately half of humanity are men and the other half are women, half of humanity.
Is manliness?
AC: And the other friend.
A: Is feminity?
So, why?
So, does it ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
Have you told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
And I would have surprised myself.
And maybe it's angry.
At 40.
Well, I am enjoying it a lot.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams.
His disappointments, his frustrations different to a man.
We just have to go by, it's on the street.
In other words, to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
What do you walk differently?
That they dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I liked my research.
And by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If not, they'll hide them.
And the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological.
Psychologists.
Is it technological?
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, the sky is everything.
In most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
And the dwell?
Is it the other?
Well, the other one.
There are women.
FR: Second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that it's in the history of civilization.
Many times, excluding groups are created.
Excripted like...
Black people excluded as projections, or Jews.
But among them there is a community.
And they say, "We identify each other."
However, women.
AC: They don't identify themselves easily.
PK: They don't say us.
In fact.
Let's see, a white woman.
Or will they identify themselves more easily with a white name?
What about a black woman?
It's a funny woman.
What if you identified easily with a funny name?
What about a projectory?
Women are not a community.
Women?
Well, they don't say us.
Because they live dispersed.
Inside the group of men.
Why?
Al board?
And it's quite satisfying.
Creating and feeling the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists.
Theories were found in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In discussion, it's philosophical.
Many men usually ask me.
(Sigh) Do you think that because you're a woman?
Of course, as if we had ovaries and a uterus and rule and hormones.
Well, it will take me any objectivity.
As if they were writing their children.
You look at you!
AC: They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
And within all that I told you I studied, biology, physiology, etc.
And I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Nature is that?
(Pre-recorded voice) The whole society does not say, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
And in other terminals?
QD: You're not born a woman.
Should I be blind?
What is it useful for?
And I was quite privileged.
QD: When I published my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
Is it?
A complete, integrated individual.
It's integral.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Go back to Sclava de Suez POceau.
To have children.
to dedicate them to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
Therefore.
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
It's consciousizing us.
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
AC: With price.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman.
And each man?
(Laughter) And you have to decide.
But above all, what he wants, for his sexuality.
To talk about what he dreams.
Not to be under a family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
What if you want or not to work?
With free choice.
FDB: Libre, will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together.
Between men and women.
So, what do I want is that we feel?
That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a whole society.
SV: Beautiful.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
FR: Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Laughter) To be honest, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the steel role, which is an hypno.
In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And in the end it says.
And this slope these thoughts for them to be told.
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
Also, right?
And now breathe, you surely have been breathing at home.
Because you know them, right?
(Laughter) Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
It was a couple of years old.
So, a group of mine from my school went out to marry for the job legalization.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom.
And that he couldn't steal a parade from the time of the Congress.
Well, he came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
I look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
And it's full of kids.
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, the same thing was understood, right?
This that for my mom was so surprising and unexpected, is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of books and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
All of them.
And there are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And there are teenagers, children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all then.
That is, the attitude I see many teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a distopy.
(Laughter) It's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
And we have to fight to change.
And then they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change, where we, the youths.
Those who are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
DB: Anywhere where you do a death bag.
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jermaí.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
(Laughter) On the contrary, I think it's present in all areas of our lives.
In the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
EV: Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
And sometimes my friends or my family criticize me.
To pay attention to people who make xenophobic comments or to talk about political things.
Audience: Yes!
And as long as many people want to avoid these issues.
To not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
Do I have to say?
And besides, it's worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and River's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
And if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
Well, I talk to this person.
Well, I listen to your opinion.
And I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
I think of these things.
Because he can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
Not going to play our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see markets and political spaces in general not as dangerous, not as it scares, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and I hope there is always, but always, there is always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without a little surprise.
PK: It's full of kids.
Thank you very much!
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a wall like this?
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted?
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life.
And if we wouldn't exist in it, in fact, human beings, we are composed of over 65 percent of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the manantial lakes.
Through agriculture.
From the livestock of our big companies and even from our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
Or, it is the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
It's according to the World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people to 2016 live without access to drinking water in the world.
And this represents that if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two.
You won't have serious problems.
Or to have access to water.
And from that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is somehow paradoxical, since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
And we'll realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry.
That is the octavo country with largest hydroe reserves in the world, at least 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even further, to these two countries.
Almost 20 million people, around 20 percent of the country's population.
That is, they live without clean water every day.
Well, these are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth is in front of this situation.
Great!
So, exactly this question.
The one that made four zanagota doctors leave everything behind.
And we wanted the bags and we got together again to bring drinking water.
thousands of people in Latin America.
From Mexico?
Funding like this, you go to the project.
Of course!
It's a piece of carcavan.
What do we call the "Cerla Blanca"?
And, above all, you would take care of a tremendous desire to give back to someone.
Luckily.
We did have had, for having been born.
We launched.
During the way we were going to meet with rural and white communities.
Well, they rarely have water at home.
So, all of them, I could go to poths or marantial rivers.
Well, to be able to see, but always with a problem.
(Laughter) The water has this pinea.
It's counting.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat: the glass, make it cry, or directly how.
Fourth, three.
It assumes a huge cost of resources for people who practically don't have art.
There's money resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go pick up the fire and then avoid.
And we asked ourselves.
What can we do to help increase this problem?
Parting from the basis that we weren't experts in the matter, we put humans to the play.
And after many weeks of research.
We found a system.
Understanding by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these meals.
I'm going to teach you my future.
It's a filter that works almost like a body.
And contaminated water goes through it.
And this one goes back to all particles.
(Video) Magnor, with a love molecule.
(Laughter) Stop going crazy, clean water.
(Video) Retening in 99% of all these substances are damaged hours to health.
I really have a system,
Great!
CR: The most efficient thing to bring clean water.
Well, immediately.
And also, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider it.
What is it?
Thank you!
A: The same weight of water to make it work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these painters?
In the lives of all these people?
A: Well, that's it.
We want to tell you a story, it's Leo's story.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community.
But it's funny, both he and all his pobling.
They took a lot of money and time to get drinking water.
As the abasteded manandial was very polluted by the skeptical stages of the king.
To our move.
And Leo signed up in an English course.
Can't you imagine?
So, the illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
To fulfill, among other things, their dream.
And the truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on?
There are more than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
They will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now?
Thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago.
It was just an idea, so we realized a bit of the dream we had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
We had never been alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign that was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together?
Have we created a social movement?
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
Can it be one of the risks of the greater risks?
The one facing the human being in the next 10 years.
According to the world's economic supply, what don't we hear?
Is it once?
We asked ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
It was in the West.
We have created a lot of necessities.
That we all know they are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
We have seen this project with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
Where have we seen?
As big embotellers, they were appropriating themselves.
from the local earthquakes that supported communities, therefore they were completely taking off the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those land, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil oil?
Well, for us, all of us.
Or can we fill our cars' deposit?
And what they are doing is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there.
And it's amazing, they're making the communities have to be displaced.
And it has a future.
This will probably cause.
And it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible.
And living it hasn't left us.
(Laughter) It has left us open.
It's really something that seems and we really think it seems.
That is, it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
That is, it's a reality.
That not only.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The water crisis is a reality that today, November 12, 2016.
And it is directly affecting us.
Everyone feels in this room.
But you don't need to go very far.
In California?
Well, with a world of technological development.
They are mutating people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
RB: For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffered Equiel.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
The more water houses will suffer in the future.
What if it really was?
And we want to make a change, if really.
We want to impact on this planet.
Well, what we have to do is all of us.
What we all have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems.
And what we have to do is also educate all our children, all our families.
Over what are the problems and the real needs.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
Well, what we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
This small NGO that is trying to build forces in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Why don't we try each other?
Farming a little pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really be?
To make the life that these big companies say, that today, of course, they're not doing the right things.
Do we really have to?
Appreciate and value the incredible luck we have to get to our homes.
Opening the glass of water.
And what always?
It always drops water, or it's not like that.
AC: Let's go, please.
To harm this resource.
And we don't think so.
But...
Believe me.
That is to say, it's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
And we have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act, and we have to do it.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
There are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
That's it!
It's our way of doing.
What is your mind?
How nice is it for what?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I'm going to start the conference by making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are energy sources, and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, talk about the heart, I buy myself with you, that I'm going to talk from the heart, if you open the heart, you surely can receive 1000% of what I'm going to say, if we stay trapped in the mind, only one part, so it's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines in front of us to put ourselves in a context: How is society today? Raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
(Laughter) It's not true!
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
An accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you saw the answers you just gave, and then to another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy,
DB: Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
Hello!
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are, what we are?
So, society is not there.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy, and if I had always spoken more or less questions, would have told us in that line, lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized?
Even head oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we see, if we are tied to the media, of information?
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids' diary and we tell them: look for good news, bad and neutral news, day money, how good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby, not good, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
When they ask me how you are perfectly fine, it's soon that 7th of July 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something is wrong, we complain about absolutely everything. What is the heat 3 of black 3 in the afternoon? What happened to you?
DB: You don't complain about anything!
So, we've become a society that's funny.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, so it's a disaster, this is this, and this has to change, it has to change the country, the society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into recramologists, and the maximum, or pinologists and all thegos.
We wait for all of you and tell us, maybe you heard someone who says it.
I don't feel capacited to make options, but we have everything, I've proved it with my friends, there's a friend Fernando who goes to the shirt with him and I say to him, "I bend with no batteries in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries because he climbed the soy?"
(Laughter) You get that pain is going down there, because we know everything, we choose economy, politics, and...
And here is even more worrying: we have started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain.
And we are immersive in opinion, what makes us have fallen in a sort of vital distancing.
You have to leave our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also have a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy there was.
And we started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
In addition, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was a little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the ring, I wanted wonderful, and the ring says: "Yes, but tomorrow it is announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, above all our generations, that we have left, in front of society in moral crisis, which is not even the most perverse mind of our grandparents, you could imagine, faced, breathed, but of course, we are making believe our children, that we don't have a future.
Not only do we stop this, but we make them believe this, how this phrase is represented: "You are the architects."
And what do you want? Are we in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
But if we believe in generations that well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived, leaving me, which was an hell.
So I looked for more knowledge of mobility, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude.
Multiplicates.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimistic guy, you are a heavimist guy, and if you have a merd attempt, that's a type of merd.
Sorry.
So I started to say, well, how do I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, my attitude changed, and everything changed, I had a decision to change the attitude and everything that happened to me and I started to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I was going to do, who was looking for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justifying, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the protagonist of an installation is a square meter, this square meter I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you and me, and you know what here, in this square meter, I live in the energy I want to vibrate, this square meter, lives in a respectful world, so it goes with a shirt that says " respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to live in a different world, because living in hell, I went through hell, I remembered once I was going to solve and I said to him, "Miss, give me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!
I was in hell and in paradise, I saw happiness exploit every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
I ask to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
And if all the time we'll be waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate, think there are many ways to educate.
For me alone, with the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So it's already in the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see.
From our square meter we have to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things, and the protagonist of those people in change, is not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And if you are with a group of pessimists, you are a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, that's a failure, that makes you a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
If you start a square meter to contagiate solidarity or yourself, start to emit that energy, because what energy emits your square meter, where you are, what's important isn't what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo of side, one would give it, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Pascuas," and she tells me: "These people were born and I, the first one that made me happy, Páscoa, what are you waiting?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
And what are you up to?
A respect?
I respect, emits encounter, emits gratitude.
Amone inconditional, what is emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you say, what you receive, this is like MMS, if you are in AM and you go from one AM point to the other side, you're going to listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody, and it's more in FM, you have the long ones.
The frequency is that you want to listen, you can choose.
But if you are in the DM, even if you go from one end to the other, you'll listen to it.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first match is playing against myself, well, I wake up, I don't get up, a wind with bad humour, or with good humor."
With bad humour or not, with good humour, well-disposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence or media creates this difference, the path you take is a church as you get up, those victims or protagonists, you will show what you want to build for the generations that come or will be functional to the interests that today are governing us and taking away from domesticated noses, people drive it for fear.
And my father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Why?
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this Dalbis Foundation, Fronteras, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we were doing, last week we gathered veterans from war of Argentinians and British, a british board came, a burk, and gathered with Argentine veterans and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won, and they know who to close the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
(Laughter) Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a second is born.
I invite you to see it, I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the Foundation Markuy without Borders. It was, in 2012, I went to work soja of gas to a conflict between realities and prestines that had been 70 years old.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
And I understood that all the time I was worried about what I was missing, and one morning I saw a Palestine woman was the city of Belén, she came and hugged with other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration, so I said.
What are they celebrating?
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, with drinking water at home all week.
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water and celebrate it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
And do you know what the genius is in lamparadine all through the translator?
And they told me, "I have no idea."
So I'm going to explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me all excited and says.
And they gave my hands of hot water.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment?
But if all the time I was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink, if I would be able to give a bathroom, if I would have it.
Where to sleep?
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
And it stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had.
And to finish this, with this story, I want to propose an exercise all of you in this state that we are now.
And there will be three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes, close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never give them value, we don't give them importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to bathe, have water, start making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
It's like our senses, our friends.
Things like that!
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room who have been welcome or selected or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now.
That is, they express that gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding the strongest thing you can shout, doing what you want, express the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life if you feel it right now.
From this moment on, I start standing and applause to myself strongly.
It doesn't matter, the fino of everyone, living.
With what we have, with what we receive.
(Applause) For the love of our loved ones, or the abundance in which we unite, for the things we don't realize.
For the protagonists we can be in our lives.
You can shout, you can add to the chair, you can do whatever you want.
We are in a society at a bended moment, very well, very well up.
(Applause) Well upwards, this is the gratitude we have to express for everything we have.
(Applause) Barbano, Barbaloist.
Great!
(Applause) And what full of it?
Keep there for a moment.
The longest path to go.
There are four pads when we moved from our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we realize everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We managed to turn off the turn for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
This that we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Is it to the genius of Aradin's lamp?
So he asks him what you will start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much.
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin.
In pulsa.
It's a mosquito rate!
When the sun comes out, Maluna!
Oh!
But music also lives in the pauses.
In silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive: "Music is a language.
Since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy.
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, so that we can all go together and grow in community.
Music?
It generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Ten?
Have you come?
It's not easy to face this way in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be like.
Isn't it?
(English) bullying those physical or verbal aggressions.
That's why they're also known as school support.
It's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems, but it's been 5 or 10 years ago.
I think few of us had heard this word.
Very good.
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age that we have, we have an experience with this kind of situations, or because we live it in our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, regarding our poor partners of our childhood, or because we simply prescribed it, it was called "Take a point to someone to mock."
Now I know if it's bullying.
Well, but I think that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, right?
No, you have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
And this for various reasons: first, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
And it wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to accumulate laws to claim or to criminalize it, of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was something more or less normal, able an indesee consequence, an lateral effect.
And with the undesirable task of school coexistence.
But not that serious, right?
And some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, which is that at that same time, that is to say, not so long ago, other school drames were considered much more serious than those fights without importance that occurred in the recreations and in the halls.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now going out, they tend to do the opposite, right?
The bad grades and the disciplinary repriments seem to be increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying occupies a increasingly central role.
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time, on the one hand, these more reasons.
They are the school humiliation traditions, which are the castles applied by an authority, as a teacher.
Or a directive.
Students did something considered incorrect.
Is there something forbidden by regulations or something considered that shouldn't be done?
It's like behaving bad or not studying, on the one hand, that's how we lose weight.
And, on the other hand, they earn priority.
They are school humiliation reasons.
And what are these scenarios?
And that the same students apply to each other.
For the most different reasons.
But almost always because of something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
(Laughter) If this is actually happening, the question would be why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a big historical change.
No, a big historical change.
That it's overcome what's worth it.
Because we think that on the one hand ...
In those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts.
There are various amounts, expulsions, bad grades.
What operates there is fault.
Sorry for having done something the same.
That is, something bad.
That is, fault is an internal, private emotion.
It refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each and himself.
(Laughter) For having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect.
I know everyone think that's wrong.
He even cried.
(Laughter) I feel guilty because I did something bad.
Now, in the case of bullying.
And it's not the guilt, what's at stake.
No, but another kind of emotion.
And be ashamed.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
And it doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong.
Or something wrong.
So, in the case of shame, the problem is not me.
Or, if not, the others.
Well, the rest.
And the look of others, that judges me.
In an incorrect and fair way.
Sometimes cruel.
Beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty at all.
They are us who exercise my that cruel look.
So?
It's a transformation, and I think this one ...
With the transformation of balance.
To be more important, embarrassment than guilt.
And I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of others.
What obviously was always important.
And lately, he has gained a demeasurable weight.
Perseated!
Audience: Oh!
But, above all, when playing, who is each and how much it goes?
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change, and of course, it's a very complex change, that's not the time it's been generating, it's been done for decades.
And it's finishing of consuming now, it's crystallizing now.
(Laughter) And I think one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
Is it?
Because abandonment.
From the idea of interiority.
That's why it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us and designed it as Ident.
It's the conviction that the inner life existed.
Or something essential?
But invisible to the eyes.
And it was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and true way that appearances.
So, those appearances.
In other words, it wasn't only considered bananas.
but also fake, private.
As something lower, it doesn't matter.
Compared with all the dissemination of that veracity or inner beauty, well, I think that all this is values and beliefs that still remain between us, but we are abandoning them, these ones up to transform themselves and we are abandoning those beliefs, for example, in the phenomenon of culto to the body, which has developed in the last decades, the importance of the personal image, of the physical aspect, the theme of gymnastics, esthetic treatments, all of that.
But it's not the guts, not that it's inside each one, it's something you don't see, it also matters a lot, and each time it's called meaning, it's what you see, and the notion that the most important thing of each one, but that's not the flu, but an immaterial thing.
Like the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increasingly believe in that, and more and more in what others can see, what we show what we do, and according to these transformations, others judge us from what they say.
And less from that notion that there's something inside, eternal, medium-sized internality, an anti-question, that would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this.
We find a series of indices of transformations.
And one of them would be the self-management, the tactics or the self-production techniques, which are everywhere, and why?
Not long ago it would be considered a bad taste, but let's think of the achievement, the obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or I like, this too to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and who deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries.
Scattering through reality shows.
And why bullying?
(Laughter) But thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious today.
In other words, fault is no longer that effective moralizing, because it seems that fault has lost a good part of its moralizing efficiency, like embarrassment.
That is, to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
(Laughter) Two.
If we are accounts that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk.
That this alien look, doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance as well, that ignores us.
So, we haven't become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying when these mothers are...
Or about famations?
They disseminate on social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what they used to be private used to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the school walls or at home, suddenly.
It exposes to millions of people, everyone knows it.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, much more serious.
And we don't have where to take refuge.
(Whispering) Or inside yourself.
(Laughter) Not intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping on an island somehow, that there are less or less exist, at least not without Wi-Fi, which is the theme.
QD: So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we may poster with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) If all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do, too, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad?
How do we solve it?
That's not good or animal in itself, or it seems that both shame and embarrassment are mechanisms of social control, and the fact that guilt is losing a large part of its future now and that embarrassment is magnifying, is losing a good part of its future, but it's something we have in mind.
It's a fact.
Because if we continue, which means things changed in fact, so if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before, and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far.
Well, that's what he wanted.
I received her days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
One of the people told me.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
But a doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I'm thinking a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think that yes, we are learning some important things.
And I would like to share three of those ideas that are spinning around these days and that hopefully, one of those are useful to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, all of us, teachers together, have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Education innovation is something close to what's been talking about, but that up to now occur in isolation by separation.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance.
And in this process we need to encourage ourselves to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that we didn't need to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available, but that we had never had the urgency in periods in need to use.
You see tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, so-called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching.
And especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, these strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, and little by little in the middle of the frustration it brings, to have to adapt them so fast.
Even trying to have patience and do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
But we are taking the taste to test new ways of teaching and learning.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
(Video) Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know from yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, older people began to show how the compound was to make bank paperwork to people of their age.
We're learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
And just like what happened once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn when and how.
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own time.
Some study more at night, others start with the subjects that are more interested, others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to stop understanding something that doesn't happen to them.
Or to learn the new ones who wanted to.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working peace.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them when we're very young.
organizing their time.
To manage tasks and all that requires to learn to learn.
And my last reflection is rather a question.
What happens when it happens in these days?
We don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
Well, when boys and girls can't go to school.
It disappears stronger than ever, as a space that guarantees that everyone can learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if it's happening to our days.
We realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever by the differences between home.
And it's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
DB: It's because it has a calm place to study and not.
The one here has to ask and not.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home and those who don't.
Well, the school, with all its difficulties, at least during one single leave, puts, at least, the inequalities and helps all the boys and girls.
They are protected and focused.
A: And how about learning?
As an educator I'm very worried about how all this will follow and I also wonder what will be left of what we're learning in this fourth.
My feeling is...
When they get bad marks and they're on the naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes.
And also on the beach some treasures appeared hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
In this historical moment, it's not for the good ones.
It helps us make our own treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
Let's raise the use of time and ways to learn and also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
A door to keep building, one of those opening up today the physical waves are closed, but among all of them, when all this happens.
It's the education we dream.
A: Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the Corentena lasted too long for two months and that suddenly we got used to living like that.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers from their house.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up 7 toM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers finally understood the work of Bubble Drail, finally, that mythomans and Chisms were regretted in the diffusion of conspiranóid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions before, peanphiles, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for devastating and I dreamed that we could vote from home, opening yes or abortion, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then we always earned most of a day for the other, without dinner, nurses, or catalogical representatives, deciding instead of the people.
I dreamed that the Church was also an online, the misses were given on YouTube curas, and of course it was forbidden to launch them on Youtube Kid.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported the lawyers and the judges.
And that from one day to another, all those who had ever been rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert and that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business, and we had a line in the street, automatically by taste, always keeping a meter and a half away with the next one.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the dunk and that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing before or we felt loneliness.
And I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day in important things, and that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or they did addicts to something else: I dreamed that the TED talks we had to see from home and do it from home, and that it didn't last 18 minutes, but that it lasted to leave.
(Laughter) I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, proliferated suddenly wildlights and lobo.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later, the government announced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very short communicator, the president told the people that it was possible to go out in the street.
That you could make a normal life, leave to say the president, occupy your jobs, leave your homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9th of July and that we all went out like crazy in the street and we walked to the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal and without wanting.
We suffocated it and killed it.
And that an intricate truck crashed against the snail of the struggle and fell off the truck tons of wine card.
And that more people came out of their house.
In the street, to take selfies with the dead avestruz and steal wine and shout.
And soon someone joined another and the journalists pointed to transmit live massacre.
And then, over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
It's not something that when you see a photo.
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing and the idea of what to know.
And it helps you see what you see in front of you.
In other words, as a walk, as a visite in a place with little friends on Facebook, that we draw.
AD: And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
A few days ago I asked my mom: "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks?"
In just 30 seconds.
A little bit said to me!
And just like I did, I felt challenged and I decided to try it.
And if I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds, I'd eat the last one with a cream that was staying at the bottle.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
So I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
They had a girl that roughly a month ago, every day she had a photo with the bells in number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, singing the happy birthday.
So I assumed I was a very friendly person.
In three of his publishings there were some bench art pieces.
And I said, "That's it, this girl likes art."
Something that later I could confirm with some photos she looked like painting.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
PK: What is a trans girl you're at school last year and who's currently studying graphic design?
And among all that, I could also see that it's a healthy person who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so it's very respectful with the environment.
(Laughter) But when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
And my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could know a person like that through social media.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what we want to have.
That not because I'm there means that I leave 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is.
DB: And what he wants to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
AC: To go from a general idea of that person, to get to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first meet the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person, understanding this way what I see in my first impression.
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
But I didn't play it for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier for me to know it.
Or why does she choose to show us their reality?
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
So, after making these species of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like in which I spoke about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself what am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like this, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and eating my very deserved me, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't search for a label to fit it, I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask him to use on social networks.
AC: Thank you very much.
And I would like you to pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
Yes?
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
(Pre-recorded voice) Hello.
Two eyes in different parts of the face.
They talk about having somewhere.
Effectively.
Some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build a backward look.
Also, the nazal sacrifices, the mouth's cracks, the limits of their ears, are not good for them and details.
It was fundamental elements to build what we would call the portrait's look.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
What is it?
And it was the faces side that the spectators searched.
The elaboration of a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada, and at the same time it is looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought about it.
What would it be if we could see how I look at a spectrum?
In a popular positioning team in a neuroscience lab we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image in the chemo.
How?
Our eyes select specific parts of that face to extract information, since the rest constitutes it.
(Video ends) If we placed all the images.
Looking at them together in the image we could see which relevant parts are when creating the portrait and which ones not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
We built it was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
To this brief message for the journey of an eye.
What is this?
It is somehow a strict of some projects that led to Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a trip, a trip through different landscapes, customs.
And me, mom?
In which we travel with some art maps and various leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally, what encourages us is the search of establishment, questions, the expectation.
Well, at the moment.
Do you know what we are born?
We start to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so.
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
"Nobody wants to be good."
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me.
What are you so young taking care of old people?
(Pre-recorded voice) It's my future that answered to her: Who are you living for many years and I'll go there?
And what they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be good.
Isn't it?
Meet to live in a society where the most important thing is.
Yes?
Or seem young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They keep losing value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
Miedo.
And let's go to the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted. Can we see them?
In publicities, in labor searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes.
And they embrace older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the vessor of social debt.
They tell us that 70 percent of the elderly people in Argentina are self-related, that is, they can take care of themselves.
Taking care of others.
Or this shared belief?
It has become the oldest stantists or depressed ones.
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that's it.
It's much more than what people in my age or even younger.
Or this passive class label.
It's passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent.
To so many elderly working today, they are creating.
They are doing sports, participating in volunteer.
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
You know?
And it's the difficult thing for a person.
5 more?
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
Even when it is proved?
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just one.
In general clinic.
What is this how we are preparing for the new longevity we suffer from?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media.
They aren't helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them.
Why?
And every time it was about the subject of older people, they used the same photo.
From the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
The press is gained, it has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults.
And the third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
DB: Great!
It's old.
I still don't find a word.
that identify the according to everything.
The only one that suggests to avoid.
No, is your grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
Why affection some of them justify?
But it's because of affection.
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
And older people.
They have a name.
Like everything.
What do you do with stereotypes?
And they hurt.
Shouching?
And they become invisible to many.
(Video ends) Today in Argentina.
(Laughter)
What a mess!
They are more than 60 years old.
In 2050?
That's going to see older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also there.
Everything in the world.
We are now.
It was an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs.
And to design new products and services.
A new longevity opens new doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
And in this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment.
Or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity.
They would continue studying and training.
But, however.
Awareness and education proposals.
Do you have it?
They are thought.
Almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
The opportunity.
In other words, we can't detect them intuitively.
Because the elderly.
A group.
Very different.
And that doesn't respond to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
We still didn't go through that time.
That's why my proposal.
It's that we listen and we learn from that.
Are you older?
To really understand what their new needs are?
And their new possibilities?
Girls and tastes.
A while ago.
Entrevisting an older person.
To me, one would be clear if they wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
To each stage.
Let's see, in life.
It has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Don't worry.
We are the ones who are going to do.
