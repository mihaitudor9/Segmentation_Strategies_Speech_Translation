We are Chello.
Let's see, the instrument brought from distant lands and orchestra music, we filled it with what's vital, we do through the Argentine club with biodenchens, part.
But we had a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we go, the protagonist.
From our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play it, so that it sounds like a folklore, and it can dance, look at Rav√≠o and live.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
And that's what we had to learn how to work.
It's called by video, each one attacked their part.
That's how the other can play on them and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Why?
That's what worries me about sacrifice.
So it's a phenomenon.
And relatives are those who don't recover.
What this time?
But he is crying, right?
And they wake up at parties.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic, something that we dedicate to checking the contents of social networks and fighting misinformation, they were already seeing.
And not worrying about this new idea.
During the pandemic, the flu.
In 2009, there was already on Twitter, risk and YouTube, but its consumption, global supertraction, was much cheaper.
The pandemic, COVII9 is the first pandemic that lives with my approach.
What is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called "Terda," because it creates panic and gender distrust.
Disinformation is always dangerous, we know it.
Because what can affect, because what can put in danger is our lives directly.
We don't have an idea at all.
To circulate these days of the amount of garbage on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they may not agree with a virus.
(Sigh) Every day the viralization of content without verifying.
Four weeks ago with my team.
We work.
Without resting, checking, tricks, truths that circulate over this new disease.
I know that we know and we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible, and sometimes they're frustrated.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
They can be linked to COVID-19 enclosing.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that counting cells until then will be more prepared.
And they are more prepared that they can help to stop this balance of information that can on us.
The four categories are simple: The first has to do.
(Video ends) With content linked to the origin of the disease.
In comparative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them from Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014: "This is true."
If you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus, don't take it seriously, shock it, there is no sun evidence.
The second category is related to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to false treatments and jury, is the most dangerous, it has to give us more attentive.
To those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true that there is already a vaccine that taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making us drinks with hot water and salt water, or making vapor is expensive to disappear from our body if we are infected, that will heal us, but at the moment it doesn't have a completely satisfactory answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, or access to different measures to the opposite measures of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social aliation was dissolved, 15 days ago or a little more.
He runs through a failure of credit that said that quarantine starts at 3 pm of that day, and obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say it's going to fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world, and so it makes us fear, that not only we'll have to be locked up in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation in general try to generate panic and anxiety, that's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that comes from one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, like the world organization of health or health ministry, distrust.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
Why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
We're not comfortable.
And when do we miss a thesis?
And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty, without all care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, it's not cheated.
Great!
Don't share it.
Let's replace comparison with such a habitual doubts.
(Laughter)
I don't share my doubts.
We take care of this.
If you receive a content.
Like Egypt, someone and cover what false, don't streets, confirm and carefully.
And if you share a content and then you realize that fake news don't street you.
Disculpate and correct.
And that's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day, while, in order to get the cure and need time, science works intensely to get the cure of evidence and information.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era in which the answers were missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those empty with blue content, because we're not able to tolerate our ignorance, we'll be much worse than tolerating them.
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working is a means of pain, of other people.
It doesn't make you a person, bitter, sad, the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, not as we wanted them to be, but to see a filagon in an act of reconciliation.
No, sorry.
And of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generates the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more on our omnipotenty, to be humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed, when despite having done everything possible, the result is not what they expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
And it's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
And finally I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, it's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate love and compassion, may tear.
It's a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Recently...
I was 40 years old.
So, after writing several novelas, I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why, when a man is introduced, is enough for him to say it?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
Well, for a woman like me.
Do I have to decide good night, I'm a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves to say?
I had a lot to start my research.
about women's condition.
QD: It was already written on many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Half of humanity is manliness and the other half are women, approximately half of humanity is manliness. So why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry.
At 40.
I am enjoying it a lot, it's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time they are ignored.
AC: And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations different to a man.
It's enough to walk in the street, to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
who walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist on women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological.
Psicological, technological.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, the sky is everything.
In most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women are the other, they are the other.
Women.
FR: Second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Excrued as blacks, excluded as Proletaries or Jews.
But among them there is a community, they say: "We identify ourselves."
However, women.
That is, they don't identify themselves easily.
(Pre-recorded voice) They don't say us.
In fact.
So, a white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name.
What about a black woman?
It's a funny woman.
What if you identified easily with a funny name?
What about a projectory?
Women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live disperse within the group of men.
Anything.
Al board?
(Laughter) It is very pleasant to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the antifeminists sought theories in religion, theology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In discussion, it's philosophical.
Several men usually ask me, "You owe this because you're a woman."
Of course, as if for having ovaries and uterus and rule and hormones I would take away any objectivity.
That is, as if they were writing their children.
You look at you!
AC: They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
(Whispering) And inside everything I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
And I'm going to tell you something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Nature is that?
(Pre-recorded voice) The whole society does not say, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
Well, in other terms.
QD: You're not born a woman.
It's yoga to do it.
And I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Well, therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds, it was a complete, integral, and integral individual.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Go back to Sclava de Suez POceau.
To have children, devote yourself to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
His feminity resembles to that.
AC: I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
Are we aware of it?
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
Well, with free will.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman and every man.
(Laughter) And they must decide what they want for their sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
What if you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together between men and women.
So, what do I want is that we feel?
That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
(Pre-recorded voice) And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a whole society.
Powerful.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
FR: Thank you, thank you.
(Laughter) To be honest, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the steel role, which is an hypno.
In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And at the end, he says: "And these thoughts for them to give them?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
Also, right?
And now breathe, you surely have been breathing at home.
(Laughter) Because I know them, right?
(Laughter) Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
Carrillo.
A couple of years ago.
So, a group of mine from my school went out to marry for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
Well, he came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
I look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow, it's full of kids!
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, the same thing was understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that today is super natural to me: talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all there are villains that oppress, that discriminate against the rest, that say they are more.
And there are teenagers, children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like the one of those books.
And we have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in a terrifying distopy like that of climate change in which we, the youths, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Where does a death bag do?
There must be aarry, and, of course, there is also a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it is present in all aspects of our lives, in the culture we consume, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is good or bad.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
And as long as many people prefer to avoid these issues, to avoid fighting, their uncomfortable situations.
No!
I know there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone in their political position is not the same as fighting for me because I am in mouth and a kid's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
And if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
Because he can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
And when many say: "Let's keep quiet."
I say, let's talk, even if it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future and regulate our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see markets and political spaces in general not as dangerous, not as it scares, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and I hope there is always, but always, there is always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without a little surprise.
PK: It's full of kids.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a cup like this to take water home?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted?
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life.
And if we wouldn't exist in it, in fact, human beings, we are composed of over 65 percent of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the main lakes, through the agriculture of our large companies and even our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not only about the appearance of diseases around the world, but also the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world, this means that if we selected 10 people randomly from anywhere on Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Well, of that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is somehow paradoxical, since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even further, to these two countries.
And almost 20 million people, that is, around 20 percent of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
Well, these are all these numbers that, looking back, made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth is in front of this situation.
This question is exactly what made four doctors of zarabota leave everything behind.
We wanted the bags and got together again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, Mexico.
Funding like this, you go to the project.
G.G: Let's do it.
It's a piece of self-caravan, so we call the Blanca Ferla.
And, above all, we were loaded with a tremendous desire to give back to the world the luck that we have had, for having been born.
We entered it into the advantage.
During the way we were going to find them with rural communities and rural camps that rarely have water at home.
(Pre-recorded voice) All of them could rivers, poths or marantials.
To be able to see, but always with a problem.
(Laughter) The water has this pinea.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat: Bible, or or purchase, which as you have, requires a huge cost of resources for people who practically don't have art.
There's money resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go pick up the fire and then avoid.
And we asked ourselves, "What can we do to help increase this problem?"
Through the basis that we were experts in the matter, we put them humans to the work, and after many weeks of research we found a system.
Understanding by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works almost like a body.
The contaminated water goes through the child.
And this contains all the largest particles than with a love molecule (Laughter) leaving getting crazy, clean water, retaining in 99% of all these substances so damaging about health.
Audience: Yes!
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately.
And also, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider that only the weight of water exists to make it work.
Can you imagine?
So, what's the impact of these filters in the lives of all these people?
A: Well, that's it.
It's Leo's story, we want to tell you a story: Leocruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he and all his pobling, in order to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by ethical stages around him.
To our move.
And Leo signed up in an English course.
Can't you imagine?
So, the illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
To fulfill, among other things, their dream.
And the truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
I mean, they will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatem√°n Proy came up with an idea, we realize a little of the dream we had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
We had never been alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign that was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together we have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
It is an unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There are still a lot to do, millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis can be one of the risks of the biggest risks in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not that we hear us.
So we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident, we have created many needs that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those land, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil oil?
so that we can all fill the deposit of our vehicles.
And what they are doing is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers, communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there and it's amazing, they're making the communities move.
And in the future, this is what will likely cause, it disappears until its culture.
But it's really incredible and living it hasn't left us.
It has left us something that has opened.
It's really something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
It's a reality that is not just one.
It's a reality that affects underwhelmed countries, the world's crisis, on November 12, 2016.
It affects us directly and each one feels in this room.
But you don't need to go very far.
In California?
It was with a technological development world.
They are mutating people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
RB: For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the shortage of water in the future.
But if we really want to make a change, if we really want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is to raise awareness, what we have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
(Laughter) And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
Well, what we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
This small NGO that is trying to build forces in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the life that these big companies say, that, of course, they are not doing things right now.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck that we have to reach our homes.
Opening water shifts and always water goes out, or it's not like that.
JP: Please, let's get rid of this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act, and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
And so we won't be able to achieve the change we want to see in the world.
Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing.
What is your mind?
What a player, how nice it is for here?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making an commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources, and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency that generates our heart, our emotion.
So I'm going to ask a quick question, above all front lines, to put ourselves in context: How is society today? Raise your hand and say to me, three or four answers, if you open your heart, surely you can receive 1% of what I'm going to say, if we stay trapped only in one part, so it's my commitment, and I see that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than thought, stressed?
Revolved, confused, aggressive, facing it.
An accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you saw the answers you just gave, and then to another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy,
(Laughter) Those of you who cry happy, raise your hand.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
You who are, who we are, aren't the society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy, and if they've always spoken more or less questions, would they have told us in that line, lost, discouraged, dismoralized, then calls the right mind oriented to the crisis?
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing, everything that's wrong, everything that I don't know if we are tied to the information media, where the answers we give sometimes go to school, we take the daily diary to the kids, and we tell them, "Be good news, bad and neutral news." The day's money, how many good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby goes well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
When they ask me how you're perfectly fine, it's plate that 7th of July 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something is wrong, we complain about everything. What is the heat 3 of black 3 in the afternoon? What happened to you?
DB: You don't complain about anything!
So, we've become a society that's funny.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, so it's a disaster, which is this, and this has to change, and the maximum, or pinologists and all the globes.
We wait for all of you and tell us, maybe you heard someone who says it.
I don't feel capacited to make options, because we do it all, I do it with my friends, there's a friend Fernando who goes to the shirt with him and I say to him, "I don't sleep without batteries in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries because he climbed the soy?"
(Laughter) You understand that the tone is going down there, low, you know, we leave everything, we opens the economy, the politics of... And there's something even more worrying: we've started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain.
No, we are immersive in opinion, what makes us have fallen in a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also had a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy, we got it out, we started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
In addition, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was a little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the ring, I wanted wonderful, and the ring says: "Yes, but tomorrow it is announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, above all our generations, that we have left, in front of society in moral crisis, that even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine, faced, breathed, but, badly, we are making our children believe that we don't have a future.
Not only do we stop this, but we make them believe this, how this phrase is represented: "You are the architects."
And what do you want? Are we in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
And we make ourselves believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
DB: All right now!
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived, leaving me, which was an hell.
So I looked for more mobility knowledge, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies, if you have the attitude in front of life, it's zero, the multiplying attitude, and you know that all the zero amount is zero, that's a zero type.
If you have that negative attitude, that's a negative type, if you have a pessimistic guy, you are a pessimist guy, and if you have a merde attitude, that's a sort of merdity.
(Laughter) Sorry.
So I started to say, well, how do I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed, I started to say what I was going to do, who looked for the changes I wanted to see.
And I left the victim's attitude all the time being justifying, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened to me as a protagonist and the first thing I saw is that the protagonist installed is a square meter, this square meter that I have depends on me, each one of you has a square meter of you, of anyone else than you and me, and you know what here in this square meter, I live in the energy I want to vibrate, this square meter, lives in a respectful world, so, with a shirt I say respect.
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter, I started showing what I wanted to see, I started deciding to live in a different world because living the hell wasn't reminded, once I was going to solve and I told him, "Don't care for three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was in hell and in paradise, I saw happiness exploit every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision, where it marks everything I lack, not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing, if we're always waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate, think there's a lot of way to educate, for me alone, with the example, every time we do something, someone is watching us, starting from our square meter, to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things. Being a protagonist is people for change, it's not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And if you're with a pessimist group, you're a pessimist, if you're with a group of failures, that's a group of infelices, that's an unhappy, if you start with your square meter to contagiate solidarity or you, you start to emit that energy, because what energy is emitting your square meter, what's important isn't what we do with all the love of the world.
And I tell the girl: "People Pascuas," and she tells me: "These people were born and I the first one that made me happy is to catch," "No, he tells me, what are you waiting?"
What are you emitting, your square meter that emits, what do you fit?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It generates unconditional love, which is what you are emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you put, this is like AMC and if you are in AMC and you go from one AM point to the other side, you'll listen to that.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first match is playing against myself, well, I wake up, I don't get up, a wind with bad humour, or with good humor."
(Laughter) They are all decisions, all small differences, the excellence, the path you take a church, as you wake up, your victims or protagonists, you're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come, or you're going to be functional to the interests that today are governing us and taking away from the domesticated gangs, people drive it for fear.
And my father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
A: Well.
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this Dalbis Foundation, Fronteras, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we were doing, last week we gathered veterans from war of Argentinians and British, a british board came, a burk, and gathered with Argentine veterans and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won, and they know who to close the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
(Laughter) Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a blind is born.
A place where I was in charge, I thought there were a lot of things missing, I invite you to see and I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the foundation for which I always had borders, was, in 2012, I went to Brasa with another lady and celebrate, no and celebrate, so I said: What are you celebrating?
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, with drinking water at home every week.
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water and celebrate it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
And I: Do you know what the genius is in lamparadine all through the translator?
And they told me, "I have no idea."
So I'm going to explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me all excited and says.
"Oh, give me my hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
Why?
And at that moment, all the time I was connected to what I was missing, I realized that, since I was born, I had to think if I would have water to drink, if I would be able to give a bathroom, if I would have where to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude, I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
The first step will have three steps in the exercise: I ask you to close your eyes to all, to close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never realize and we thank health, like the possibilities we have, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to bathe, have water, like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room who have been welcome or selected or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until now, who express this gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding the strongest thing you can shout, doing what you want, express the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life if you feel it right now, from this moment, stand up and clap very hard.
(Applause) Who makes all those endings fighting?
With what we have, with what we receive, with the love of our loved ones, with the things we don't realize.
(Applause) For the protagonists we can be in our lives.
You can shout, you can add to the chair, you can do whatever you want.
We are in a society at a bended moment, very well, very well up.
(Applause) Well upwards, this is the gratitude we have to express for everything we have.
(Applause) Barba, Barba, loist... Yes!
(Applause) And what did I come from?
Keep there for a moment.
The longest way to go?
There are four stadiums when we get rid of our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we realize everything we have and not everything we lack, when we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, but a decision.
And we managed to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
And this we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a world of a 10-year-old boy to the genius of the gradual lamp?
So he asks him what you will start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much.
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why, because music is already in us, since we are born in beats, in poths, in rhythms?
The sun comes out bad, my life.
Oh!
But music also lives in the pauses.
And it teaches us the art of listening in silence and being receptive, music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy.
Until we grow up and bring music with us, and it also creates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools to be able to go together and grow in community, so that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Welcome.
It's not easy to face this way in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be, bullying, those physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as school harassment.
It's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems, but it's been 5 or 10 years ago.
I think that few or none of us would have heard this word "bull".
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that's always happened, and, in fact, beyond our age, we have an experience with this kind of situations, that is, because we live it on our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, as well as our poor colleagues in childhood, now it's called bullying.
Well, but I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, even bad grades, both children and teachers, parents and society in general, thought that this was much more or less normal, some even thought that it contributed to friendships, expulsions, and school coexistence, but not that serious, it wasn't much more important than what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
(Laughter) Although now, on the other side, you tend to do the opposite, bad grades and disciplinary repriments, it seems that they are increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new bullying phenomenon covers a more central role, which are the punishments applied by an authority, like a teacher, or a principal, something forbidden by the regulations, or something considered it shouldn't be done.
It's like behaving bad or not studying, on the one hand, that's how we lose weight.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
They are school humiliation reasons, which are these castings.
And that the same students apply to each other.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
AC: Well, if this is actually happening, the question is: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a big historical change.
It's a huge historical change that is worth it.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts.
So, intonestations, expulsions, bad grades, what operates there is guilt.
Sorry for having done something wrong, something bad.
Guilt is an internal, private emotion refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one of us.
(Laughter) For having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect.
But everyone think that's wrong, even me.
(Laughter) I feel guilty because I did something bad.
Now, in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion.
And be ashamed.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
(Laughter) It doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong, something wrong.
So, in the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others, the others.
And the look of others, that judges me.
In an incorrect and just way, sometimes cruel.
Beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that practice on my cruel look, so it's a transformation of balance.
We have to have more embarrassment than guilt, and I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of others.
What obviously was always important.
And lately, he has won a demeasurable weight, maybe uncomfortable.
And, above all, when playing, who is each one and how much is it worth?
And this wasn't always the case.
And that's why I say it's a big historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, that's not the time it's generating, it's been done for decades.
(Laughter) And that it's finishing of consuming, it's now crystallizing.
(Laughter) I think one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
That's why it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us, and it was designed by Ident, the conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential?
But invisible to the eyes, it was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and real way that the vanish appearances.
(Laughter) These appearances are not only considered healthy, but also fake, fruitful.
As something lower, something without importance compared to the cover of the importance of personal image, physical appearance, gyms,esthetic treatments, all that, well, I think all of this are values and beliefs that still remain among us, but that we are abandoning them.
But it's not the guts, it's not that it's inside each of us, but it's not the guts but something immaterial, such as the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increasingly believe less in that, and more in what others can see, what we show, and according to these transformations, they judge us from that notion, eternal and aerial innerial innerity, an anti-defined environment, which would be more true of the acts and appearances.
Together with this, we seem a series of indices of transformations, and one of them would be the car passing through the foots and bullying, but thinking of this broader context, it doesn't surprise that today bullying has become something so serious, like embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
And this, of course, is very complicated because it requires a leadership, an administration of two vertical issues that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk that the alien look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
So, we haven't become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying, when these donkeys or disseminations spread on social networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc., and then what they used to be private, limiting the group of acquaintances, or protected by the walls of the school or at home, all of a sudden they exposed to people's villages, or all of them know, then embarrassment is terrible, it's not the theme.
QD: So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we post with respect to ourselves.
That's not good or animal in itself. Well, if all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do? Also, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad, as we solve it, and well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues read, but it's a data.
Because if we keep thinking that it means that things changed in fact, then if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before, and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far away, in that's what he wanted to tell.
I received a few days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we would not forget about these days, and one of them told me.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
But a doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I'm thinking a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think that yes, we're learning some important things, and I'd like to share three of those ideas that I've been walking around these days and that hopefully, one of those are useful to keep thinking about education from here, in front.
The first is that for the first time, all teachers together have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Education innovation is something close to what's been talking about, but that up to now occur in isolation by separation.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance and in this process we are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that we didn't need to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available, but that we had never had the urgency in periods in need to use.
See tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box, and little by little, in the middle of the frustration they bring, have to adapt them so fast.
Why?
Even trying to have patience and do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
And we take the taste to try new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
(Video) Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, older people began to show how the compound is to make bank paperwork to people of their age.
And we are learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn, just like once and again.
(Laughter) And suddenly, today, for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own time.
(Laughter) Some study more at night, others start with the subjects that interest the most, others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to stop understanding something that doesn't happen to them, or to learn to the new ones who wanted to.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on, because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy, of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working to the parade.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them when we're very young.
organizing their time.
To manage tasks and all that requires to learn to learn.
And my last reflection is rather a question.
What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks, I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's that never the differences between home, it's not just the one with a computer and the one with the Internet, the one with no.
It may have a calm place to study and not.
It's the one here to ask and not.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home and those who don't.
The school, with all its difficulties, at least during only one leave, put those inequalities in parentsis and helps all boys and girls to be protected and with the opposite focus.
GB: And in the middle of time.
Well, as an educator I really care about how this will follow and I also ask myself what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is...
They put when they get bad marks and the naked beach is left.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes.
Well, also on the beach some treasures appeared hidden.
I hope that even though, as my son said, this historical moment isn't for any good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
Let's raise the use of time and ways to learn and also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
Today, physical works are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens.
It's the education we dream.
A: Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers from their house.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because mythomans and Chisms that motorbikehers learned to be cyberattacks, to study mass media, finally, engineers shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for dislivering and I dreamed that you could vote from home, opening yes or abortion, we appreciated a button, we all said what it looked like to us, and then I always won most of a day for others, without Senators, Nurses, or catalogical representatives, deciding instead of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also an online one, I dreamed that an algorithm supported to lawyers and judges, and that from one day to another, all those who ever had rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, and do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert and that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business, and we had a line in the street, automatically by taste, always keeping a meter and a half away with the next one.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the dunk and that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing we used to do before or we played in monogos, but in truth, we either gave loneliness.
And I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day in important things, and that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
And in a very short communicator, the president said to the people that it was possible to go out to the street, or that they had habits to something else, I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, they proliferated suddenly waving and lobos, or that they made habits to another thing, I dreamed that TED talks we had to see them from home, from home, and that they didn't last 18 minutes, but they would sleep from their houses.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9th of July and that we all went out as crazy in the street and rushed the avestruz.
And then, upon leaving, I woke up and the truck fell and stealed wine and shouting, and a truck without wanting to hold it, tons of wine cardboard and we killed it on the street and that more people came out of their house and I discovered that we followed in quarantine.
And I felt better.
It's not so that when you see a photo, sometimes there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly on the picture, or people who are a little nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced the challenge of seeing with detachment, of indaging the etymology of the gesture, the visual stimulation of what you are capturing, and of the idea that knowing helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go, on a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
(Laughter) And we use them as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
A little bit said to me!
And just like I did, I felt challenged and I decided to try it.
And if I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or unite with a cremma that remained in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram, I wrote a letter by chance and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
And behind there were a lot of people, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I assumed I was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "This is it, until a girl likes art."
Something that later I confirmed with some photos in which she seemed to paint.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
PK: What is a trans girl you're at school last year and who's currently studying graphic design?
And among all that I could also see what a healthy person is, who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so he is very respectful with the environment.
(Laughter) But when these ten things had happened 28 seconds, my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could meet someone like that from social networks, it's true that in social media everyone chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
AC: To go from a general idea of that person, to get to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first meet the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person, understanding this way what I see in my first impression.
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
Well, an example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier to want to know it, I didn't play it for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier to ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like when I talked about taking care of the environment, and there I started to ask myself what I am saying to take care of the planet, if I really want to take care of it, and if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and eating my very deserved me, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't search for a label to fit it, I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask your user in social networks, thank you very much.
And I would like you to pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
And what parts of the face do you think you are looking?
And they can be aware of how their eyes move in this image, what they see first that they see later.
You surely have all happened at some point.
With two eyes, in different parts of the face, they have stopped somewhere.
Effectively, some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait.
Also, the nazial ifices, the mouth commissions, the borders of their ears, received the pores and details, were fundamental elements to form what we would call the portrait's look.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew which parts of the face were looking for.
The elaboration of a portrait is to highlight an subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada, and at the same time it is looking for the other, which is the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a popular positioning team in a neuroscience lab we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
Like our eyes choose specific parts of that face, the portrait, and which ones not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
We built it, that's what I'm showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This brief trial for the journey of an eye is the search for childhood, in the intersection of art and neuroscience, is somehow a strict for some of the projects I take along with Mariano Sigman, a journey through different landscapes, customs and beautiful scenes, in which we travel with some maps of art and various leaves of science.
Audience: Yes.
SV: At the exact moment we were born.
We start to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
Do we invest so many resources in living more and more years?
And even so.
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
"Nobody wants to be good."
Why?
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me: "What are you so young?"
(Pre-recorded voice) It's my future that answered to her: Who are you living for many years and I'll go there?
What they didn't say at that time, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this topic.
And it's fear.
Fear to be old.
DB: No!
Meet to live in a society where the most important thing is.
To be or to look young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They keep losing value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted. Can we see them?
In publicities, in labor searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
When the data of the vetor of social debt tells us that 70 percent of the elderly people in Argentina are self-beatable, that is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
IDV: That the oldest stantists or depressed ones.
When 80 percent say being happy, and that's much more than what people in my age or even young.
Or this passive class label.
The passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact on people's lives because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
And if I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a 65-year-old person?
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
And in general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
From the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad media has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults, third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
DB: Great!
It's old.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everything.
Is it the only one that suggests to avoid?
No, is your grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
Why affection some of them justify?
But it's because of affection.
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
The elderly have a name like everything.
What do you do with stereotypes?
And they hurt.
Listen.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example, in this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment.
Or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
But, however.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Well, many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people?
To really understand what their new needs are?
And their new possibilities?
They make desires and tastes.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
I was clear to myself if I wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people, and I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
