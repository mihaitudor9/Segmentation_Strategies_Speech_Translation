We do their profile at the end of the fourth research.
Cinema?
From the retirement of the Partiosa.
We had a vision.
"It does the violent of the tools we play."
Bruto Bonista.
Our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play it, so it sounds like a folklore.
And it can be oralized.
And the beginning we had to learn to work on vegetal, is called by video, each one recorded their part.
That's how the other can play on it.
And that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this kitchen.
Perfect.
(Applause) So we don't even have those of Mar Sophen.
BB: That's really it.
So I get sick.
(Video ends) And relatives are those who didn't recover.
What this time?
It rains it, right?
They wake up to see a stance.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the content of social networks and fighting them with information.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there was already in Twitter, risk and October, but its consumption, global supertraction, was much lower.
The pandemic, at 99, is the first pandemic that lives with infodebies.
What is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
(Pre-recorded voice) It called me with the material.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
(Sigh) misinformation is always dangerous.
We don't know, but when it comes to health issues it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can put in danger, is our lives directly.
(Sigh) You don't know a thing.
One of the amount of waste.
That they circulate on Instagram every day.
And you, on Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they may not agree with a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
(Laughter) For four weeks, with my team.
A: We work.
without rest.
I have fake news.
Players, truths at midst.
that circulate over this new disease.
(Laughter) They know what, we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this balance of information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they're frustrated.
(Video ends) That's why I think it's useful and I tell you what we discovered, something we found.
All the contents.
In COVID-19.
You can fit.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that counting cells until then will be more prepared.
In their category they're simple: The first one has to do?
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Three congressive theories say that...
A pioneering action of two Chinese scientists stole them in Canada until a English lab created this virus in 2014.
None of this is true, if you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus.
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus contagiates and spreads.
A wrong reading in a scientific study of a Pepper that proved that the virus lived a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there's no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Treatments and courts are the most dangerous, it's the one that has to pay more attention, the one that has to force them to be more careful.
That taking hot water with lemon, we kill albums, and making garbage with hot water and salt, or making vapor is virus to disappear from our body if we are infected, it's not true that the vaccine that will heal us.
That he was able to generate it and there was no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications, but at the moment it doesn't have a fully satisfying answer.
The fourth category of misinformation relates to false measures, or to get attached to different measures to the opposed to authorities, without the farther away in Argentina, the day the preventive and obligatory social isolation was expelled, like 15 days ago, a little further, a false of credit that said that the quarantine started the 3 of the afternoon.
And, obviously, it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you might cross with, who say you cow on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that not only we'll have to be locked in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation is in general.
They try to create panic.
And we are anxious, that's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that comes from one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health Organization or the Ministry of Salud distrust you.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
(Laughter)
We're not good.
No doubt.
We are not comfortable when we lack certainty.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
"I want to ask your favor."
And if you receive a content, isn't checking?
Let's replace comparison with doubts.
It's so common:
I don't share my doubts.
That is taking care of our ego.
(Sigh) If you receive a content.
Of someone.
And I discovered that they lack.
Take streets.
How did he turn around?
Enjoy me salt and with affection.
And if you share a content and then you realize that it's false.
Not having boxes.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Damic pandemic, infectologists, sanitarists, all the time workers, there are changes every day.
It requires time.
While there is a vacuum of evidence and information.
Ah, we have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
The answers were missing in.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those empty with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
We'll be much worse than if we tolerate them.
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today, I learned to work in the midst of other people's pain.
It doesn't make you a bitter, nor sad.
On the contrary, it teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
And I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle.
In an act of reconciliation.
of sorry, of love.
Or of transformation.
(Laughter) I learned that humor is a very powerful tool.
It allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness.
insecurity and fear generated by the presence close to death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more on our omnipotentia, to be more united.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
When despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more atterces than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
Finally, I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, is it about relating?
And to accompany.
In cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate.
Love and compassion.
You can lie down.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
So I carried on research on women's condition, so I took my pen and after several pages, I realized that this effort, as if for having several men, what I want to be aware of, what I want to do, therefore, in most women, they don't define themselves, and what I want is to be awareness, for their history, and women, whatever they are, for men, and for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for whatever they are, for men, for whatever they are, women, and for whatever they have, women, for men, women, for men, women, and women, in whatever they have, women, in men, women, and women, don't have to be defined, whatever they have, men, and women, and women.
(Applause) Good afternoon, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the taste, which is a hell in search of freedom, or a hell that talks about the thoughts that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And at the end, he says: "And these thoughts for them to give them?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
They are all ready, up too, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home.
(Laughter) Because I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Applause) A couple of years ago, a group of friends from my school went out to marry for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my other, and to be able with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them?
I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
He came with me to Congress.
And I still remember his face when we got there.
Let's look around and he told me with a smile and a big surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
Yes!
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
And I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, the Nárnica chronics.
And they are the stories of my generation.
In all there are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And there are teenagers in all.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
Yes!
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
(Laughter) Sometimes it seems they don't let us make any other option.
AC: Why did they educate us thinking that when we are living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like those books?
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change.
Where we, young people, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where you make a ball, of love?
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
(Laughter) For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
Even the bonds, even the bonds in the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is good or bad for me, have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
(Laughter) Meanwhile, many people prefer to avoid these topics to avoid fighting, their uncomfortable situations.
I guarantee that there are certain things worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
Well, I say "blind," although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us, because only talking can be built our future and regulate our present.
I hope that more and more we begin to see marchases and political spaces in general not as dangerous, not as it scares, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and I hope there is always, but always, there is always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without any surprise.
It's full of kids, thank you very much.
And you can imagine having to walk for hours every day.
Taking a cup like this one.
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
It was like that of contamination.
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN.
who attended the day by global action by water, a couple of days ago in more rocks.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings, we.
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
Despite that, every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, main lakes.
Through agriculture.
From the livestock of our big companies and even from our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
Five?
Children per day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world.
And this implies.
Why if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems?
To have access to water.
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
And since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular.
We'll realize, going to the country, which, for example, Peru, sorry, is the octave country with largest hydric reserves in the world, at least 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even further, to these two countries.
Almost 20 million people.
In other words, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
(Laughter) These are all these numbers that, looking back, made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth is in front of this situation.
(Laughter) As you can see, it represents a huge cost of huge resources and that we do the bags exactly as to Peru, starting from the basis that we were experts in the matter, and in this pinete, we found a filter that works practically like: "Let's go to the work, to the logistics of our project, but above all, to the needs of some range things, and we gathered again to search for the law and after the self-carabana."
(Laughter) By leaving only clean water, retaining in 99, contaminated water passes by the end, older than with a water molecule... (Laughter) contaminated water goes by the end.
The velar system, the most efficient to bring clean water immediately and immediately, is a completely revolutionary system if we consider that only the weight of water to make it work here, can you imagine in the lives of all these people, okay?
We want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story, Leo Cruz, a 21-year-old boy.
It belongs to October 15th colony in Trinity, in Guatemala, Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he, and all his populate, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by the epptic stages around him.
In our work, Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride that it was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well: We delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people in Mexico or Atemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, have access to drinking water for around 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatel Vancolera is an idea, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But in this dream, we were never alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign that was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
(Laughter) And it's not months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
Together?
We have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
(Laughter) But there's still a lot.
But there's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
It can be one of the risks of the biggest risks of the human being in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
(Laughter) We call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago. In this project we've seen it with our own eyes, we've created a lot of necessities that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what others suffer for us to fulfill all of them.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those large oil producers?
The big oilfield.
So that all of us can fill the deposit of our vehicles.
What they are doing here is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there.
And it's amazing, they're making the communities have to be displaced.
And in the future, this will probably cause is that it disappears until its culture.
Audience: Yes!
It's really incredible and living it hasn't left us.
What has left us open.
(Laughter) Actually, it's something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality that is not just one.
The world's world crisis affects underwhelmed countries, is a reality that, on November 12th 2016.
It's affecting us directly and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far.
In California?
With a world of technological development, people are changing because they consume too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffer from drought, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the houses of water in the future.
If it really is.
We want to make a change if we really want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is to raise awareness, what we have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
And with that, what are the solutions that will be really sustainable, what we have to do is support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption, to that small NGO?
They are trying to build powers in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
No, because we don't try, among all, to exercise a little pressure on governments.
Who are those who can really change?
These big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck we have.
To reach our homes.
In other words, opening the glass of water.
And always, there's always water.
Or it's not like that.
Please, let's stop mourning this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
No, we have to act, we have to raise awareness and act and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to change what we want to see in the world.
Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
A game, how nice it is for here.
I started the conference making an commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources, beautiful to see so many facets.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, you talk about the heart, the electromagnetic frequency that generates a thought is measured, and when we see the frequency that goes into our heart is a thousand times higher, that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than thinking.
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
If you open your heart, you will surely receive 1% of what I'm going to say to you, if we get stuck in your mind, we will surely receive only one part, so that's my commitment, to start the conference, ask a quick question.
No, it stopped.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
An accident from Cadent, well, in my talks I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answers, you saw the answers you just gave, and then to another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy.
There it is!
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
There are around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are?
What are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they've always talked about more or less questions, they'd have told us in that line: lost, decreased, faced, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we're accustomed to the media, information.
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the children's newspaper and we tell them: "Be good news, bad news, neutral, day's money." How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask a question, an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this: soccer, basket, rugby, not good, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
We complain about everything, the cold that 7th of July is 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something, something is wrong.
When they ask me how you're perfectly good, it's a joyful dish: "What happened to you?"
"You don't complain about anything."
In other words, we have become a society that is "joologists."
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, this is a disaster, this is this, and this has to change, it has to change the country, the society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into recramologists, and the maximum, or pinologists and all achievements.
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
And there's something more worrying, or, we've started to have our mind oriented to the crisis, we complain, we complain, I get to the shirt with him and I tell him, "Wow, sink without drums in that place, do you know why the soy was up?"
We are immersive in opinion, what makes it fall in a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we carried out a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy, we had it.
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
(Laughter) This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, above all our generations, that we have left, have associated with a moral crisis, that even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine, faced, risky, but also, we are making our children believe, why, if we're fine?
We don't just leave this, but we make it believe, how this phrase is represented: "Hey, how are the architects?"
And what do you want to be in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, be it, and what can we do?
We don't just leave this society as it is, but we make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time, I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that talent was important to have talent, I had to have experience, and I was getting more and more training in this, I saw that all of them add, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies.
The attitude multiplies and you know that every zero amount is zero, if you have the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimist guy, you are a heavimist guy, and if you have a merde attitude, that's a real type.
Sorry.
So I started to say, how or to get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed?
I started to decide to be a protagonist of my life, that would make you a decision to change the attitude and which was, to get out of that state of victim that had of everything that happened to me, and I started to decide who was looking for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justified, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the protagonist of an installation is a square meter, this square meter I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And of me, and you know what here in this square meter live in the energy I want to vibrate, this square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why I walk with a shirt that says " respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example, because I'm the leader of my square meter, I started to show you what I wanted to see, I started to decide to live a different world, because I lived hell.
I went through hell, I didn't remember once I was going to solve it and I told a man, "Tell me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad, I was in the interior of paradise, you see a happiness exploit every day in my life."
Besides, I live in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision, where it marks everything I lack, not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing, if we're always waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate, for me alone.
With the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, this is the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy first, protagonist attitude, I am the main character of my life.
I'm the one I want to change things. The main character is those people in change, they're not waiting for someone to take me to solve their lives, and from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because, do you know what, with a pessimist group or a pessimist, if you're failed?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo of side, one would give it, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "Startish Felices" and she tells me: "These people were born and I was the first to make myself happy and happy." And I tell her, "Hey, you bring 300 happy people, Páscoa."
"No, she says, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What are you up to?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, which is what you are emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you say, it's what you receive, this is like AMC, and if you're in AM and you go from a PM side to the other side, you're going to listen to Rademia, there's another melody.
And what's more, at FM, having the frequencies you want to hear, you can choose, but if you're in the DM, because it's not that you go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first game is against myself," "Hey, I wake up, I don't get up."
Well, I get up, I get up with humour or humour, humour, humour, or not with good humour, well predisposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence, mixing, this difference, the path you take is a church since you wake up, those victims or protagonists, you will show what you want to build for the generations that come or you'll make the interests that today are governing us and taking from domestic narrow, people driven it for fear.
My father told me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
There it is!
And I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this foundation of acts and borders that is the great blessing I invite you to see it, I invite you to see it.
To discover what we did last week we gathered veterans of Argentine and vital bottles, a role came to the British sea, a burk, and gathered Argentine competitions and together they gave a message of meeting that no one earned, and know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
It was forbidden, that a measuring unit is her.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a blind is born.
I invite you to see it, I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the Foundation Markuy without Borders. It was in 2012, I went to work as free of gas to a conflict between realities and prestines that had been 70 years old.
A place where I act was of lack, I thought I lacked a lot of things, and I understood that all the time I was worried about what I lacked, and one morning I see a Palestine woman was born from Belén, sees and embraces with other ladies and celebrations, no and celebrate, so I say, what are they celebrating?
So she says, "The water tank was filled with it."
What does cinema Antonke's water mean, that has drinking water at home all week?
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
And they celebrated it, right?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy, I asked her...
Do you know what the lamparad's genius is all through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
So I explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her, "I work with you, what do you ask me?"
The little boy looks at me emotionally and says: "Tell me the hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment.
I was connected all the time with what I lacked.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
If I could give me a bathroom, if I would have...
Where to sleep?
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
I was happy to be in the world of carency and I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
It will have three steps in the exercise: The first step I ask you to close your eyes.
To all of you, close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never give them.
Valor, we don't give him any importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to be able to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
Like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do.
So all the people in this room have it.
Now you feel, what have you been?
Being born or selected or chosen by all they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until now, who express that gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding it stronger, that can shout, with what we have, with what we get, very well up, by the things we don't realize, above, they can shout, they can join the chairs, they can do what they want, for what they've received in their lives, if they feel it right now, from this moment, and clap very strong.
The longest way to go?
There are four stadiums when we get rid of our heads.
And we connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we realize everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
This that we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in the world of a 10-year-old boy?
The genius of the radin lamp?
He asks what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
Now, to musicalize is to awaken the inner world and share it with others. Do you know why? Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin, in bones, in rhythms, and we don't need to be an instrumentist or be a musician to avoid music, do you know the Sun?
But music also lives in pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a player.
Until we grow up and bring music with us, and it also creates bridges, music creates alliances between institutions, families, schools to go together and grow in community, to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
(Laughter) Welcome.
(Applause) Believe me that it's not easy to face this in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be like, right?
bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they're also known as school harassment.
Take a point to someone to make fun, although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that's always happened, and in fact, beyond our age, we have some experience with this type of situations, that is, because we live it in our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, social problems, however, it's 5 or 10 years ago, I think a few or none of us have heard this word.
(Laughter) Well, but I think that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, you have similarities with what happens before, but it's not exactly the same, and this for various reasons, first, we didn't have a word to name the phenomenon or at least, it wasn't this bullying word.
(Laughter) I wasn't news, the media were not discussed, I didn't try to accumulate laws to claim it or to criminalize it, of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people and, in fact, it was, but I thought it was something more or less normal, some could even think that this contributed to the children's education.
But there's something important, and that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school dramas were considered much more serious than those fights, with no importance that occurred in recessions, even bad grades, both boys and teachers, parents and societies, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
(Laughter) Although now going round tends to do the opposite, which are the punishments applied by an authority, such as a teacher, or a direct, considered incorrect, something forbidden by regulations, or, on the one hand, these most traditional reasons of school humiliations, less serious, sorry, and on the other hand, they earn priority, new ones.
Teachers of school humiliation, which are these scenarios that the same students apply among themselves.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim: Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change, about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, supporters, bad grades, what operates there is fault.
Culp for having done something wrong, the guilt is an internal, private emotion refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one itself, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be because it's incorrect, but that everyone thinks that it's bad, even me.
No, I feel guilty because I did something bad, now in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion, shame, which is not exactly the same, embarrassment is public emotion.
The others, the gaze of others, that judge me in an incorrect and unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond having fault or not, of having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, are the others that practice on my cruel look, so it's a transformation.
Because it seems to me that the alien look, the look of the other, which obviously was always important, lately won a demeasurable weight, maybe uncomfortable, especially when judging who each one is, and how much it is worth.
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, which isn't from now, that's been managing for decades, and that it's finishing to consume now, it's crystallizing now, and I think one of the most important ingredients of this transformation is the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us, and made it 90, the conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes, it was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and true way that appearances.
These appearances are not only considered vine, but also fake, so-called.
As something lower, something without importance compared to the entertainment of the personal image of the physical appearance, gymnasians,esthetic treatments, all of this are values and beliefs that are still within us, but that we are abandoning them.
(Laughter) It also matters a lot, and more and more emphasis you see and you lose that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that are not the guts, not that they are inside each of them, but that they are not the tripaions something immaterial like the soul or the spirit, and according to these transformations, it seems that we increasingly believe less in that, and more in what others can see, what we show, what we do, it seems that we increasingly believe in that, and more in that, and more in what other people can see in what others can see.
Together with this, we seem a series of indices of transformations, and one of them would be the self-management, tactics or self-production techniques, that are everywhere, and that are even recently considered a bad taste.
But let's think of an example: conquest, an obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "me like" This also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and who deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries.
And because of bullying, but thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that today bullying has become something so serious, so serious, when intonestations and bad grades are increasingly serious, it has lost a good part of its moralizing efficiency.
That is, fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a gesture, an administration of two sides that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to do what we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and spread our image, but on the other hand, it's always the risk that this full look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for that same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying, when these donkeys or disseminations spread on social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what we used to be privately was to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the school walls or at home, all of a sudden, it is exposed to people's villages, or everybody knows, and we don't have where to take refugees.
So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens, and with this dependence we develop in relation to ourselves.
(Laughter) Well, if all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do?
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues read, it seems that both fault, as embarrassment, are social control mechanisms and the fact that fault is losing a good part of their future now and that embarrassment is magnificating, that's not good or animal in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind, it's a fact, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
That's what he wanted to say, thank you.
(Applause) So we talked with my kids at home and I told them that we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
He joined us to choose.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
(Laughter) I dedicate myself to researching its education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of educational and global experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
Today I'm thinking a lot about this: Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think so.
What are we learning some important things?
And I would like to share three of those ideas that are spinning around these days and that hopefully, one of those are useful to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
KA: The first time that, for the first time, all the teachers together, have the urgency to encourage us to try new ways of teaching.
(Laughter) Innovation and education is something we're talking about closed, but until now they're happening isolately by separate.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency.
Those who dedicate us to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at a distance, and in this process we are encouraging us to rehearsing new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
To reinvent the wheel, there were many things already available, but we had never had the urgency in difficult periods of use.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings, we have to adapt them so fast.
Even trying to have patience, do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
We are catching her a taste.
Take new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons to tissue workshops, even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know how to use the compound to make bank tricks to people of their age.
And we are learning the community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
Last year we took into groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
And just like it appeared once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed was...
A space, at least in part, to choose what to learn.
When and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
In these days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, some study more at night, others connect with their colleagues to do the task, or a change on the web, to finish to understand something that doesn't happen to them, or to learn something new, that they wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working the parade.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them from very young.
organizing their time.
We manage tasks and everything that needs to learn to learn.
And my last reflection.
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
That is to say, the value of school and the huge task that teachers are doing every day.
Well, when boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
So, when we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how hard it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
They have a calm place to study and not.
The one here has to ask and not.
The one who has to be all the tasks of care in the house.
And they don't.
A: The school.
With all their difficulties, at least once they go out, they put those inequalities in parentsis and help all the boys and girls.
They are protected and opposite focus.
And what about learning?
As an educator I'm very worried about how all this will follow and I also wonder what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is these days.
I ask you when you climb the tide and stay the naked beach.
Among everything that devastates that tide.
What brings down what is carried.
Also on the beach, some treasures seemed hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
This historical moment isn't for the good ones.
It helps us be own.
Those treasures we are finding.
And the desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relieve the use of time and ways to learn and also realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
Yes!
Physics are closed, but one of those is opening a door to keep building, among all of us, when all this happens.
The education we dream.
Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers from their house.
that doctors operated by télemedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
To the distance education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up by 7 toM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand the Google Drail functioning.
That motorbikehers learned how to cyberattack, that mythomans and chisms turned into the spreadion of conspirantic news through social media.
And that those who used to buy your dreams before, traffic, earners shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for smoking and I dreamed.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, marigon to free yes, or marigon to the book no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us, and then I earned most of the day to the other, without North Senators, North Americans, or Catalogical deputies, decided instead of the people, I dreamed that the Church was also online.
Money was given by YouTube and, of course, it was forbidden in my websites by Youtube Kirds.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported to the lawyers and the judges and that, from one day to the other, all those who had ever had rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
Through Google EAT.
And that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they did before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected each other, because we realized they thought about important things all day, and that seemed very good to us.
No, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
(Laughter) I heard TED talks we had to do from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one to buy imported products, I dreamed that, at night, in the big cities, the stars would meet again, were dots like in the field and that in the field.
But all of a sudden, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very short communicator, the president said to the people that it was possible to go out to the street, that normal life could be done, leave being the president, occupy their jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the cloud of July.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked towards the defeat.
To make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We suffocated it and killed it.
And that a sintriculing truck shocks against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out from home to the street.
Getting selfies with the dead avestruz and stealing wine, and screaming, and soon someone pointed to the other, and the journalists that got regretted, and then, over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause) It's not something like when you see a picture.
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
(Applause)
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't display it, take the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing.
No, and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or one with a cream that remained in the drawer, imagine my illusion when he accepted.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, singing the happy birthday, so I assumed it was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "That's it, until a girl likes art." Something that later can confirm with some photos in which she seemed painting.
So this was going down and I discovered that who is currently an object was his best friend, a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design.
And among all that I could also see that it's a healthy person, who has to rent him and drink him, so he is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
And my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could know a person like that through social media.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show, not because they're there, it means that I leave 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken months to pass from a general idea that person to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
And, thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern, and this is much more powered on social media.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram, I didn't judge her for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to choose to show us their reality.
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like the one I spoke about, to take care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself what am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like this, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and I was eating very deserved, invites with a cream.
And we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask him everything and without playing, and obviously I ask his user in social networks, thank you very much.
(Applause)
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
Can you be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what do you see first after that?
You surely have all happened at some point.
For two eyes.
In different parts of the face.
Have you stopped somewhere?
Equally.
Some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait.
Also, the nazial buildings, the mouth's cracks, the limits of their ears.
Even the pores and details were fundamental elements to form what we would call the portrait's look.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
Which were the faces parts that the spectators searched?
And developing a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she's looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a popular positioning team in a neuroscience lab, we placed several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face?
To extract information, since the rest of the brain forms it.
If we placed all the images, all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when we put together.
The portrait, and what is it not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
What we built was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This tremendous rehearsal for the journey of an eye.
It's somehow a stranger.
Some of the projects I take with Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Bostudes, languages.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The search of this kindness.
Two questions and exploration, thank you very much.
Well, at the exact moment we were born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me, "What are you so young?"
It's my future, I answered, "I want to live for many years and that's how I'm going."
What they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
Fear?
Let's live in a society?
Where the most important thing is to be or to be young.
So, fear.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They keep losing value.
What's my word?
It hasn't taken into account.
Miedo.
Let's go to the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities, in labor searchs.
In the jokes, what do we do?
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
Let's see some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the male dive of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-beatable.
That is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
that the elderly are sad or depressed.
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people in my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label.
Casi passive Class, who seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact on people's lives because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial purposes.
That includes it.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
It's the majority of public universities in our country.
There's no matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
That of the older person in a park, giving them food to their dove, do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images, words are missing.
older adults, third age.
Really.
Feelings are the pieces.
Gerant.
Ansians.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everyone.
The only one I suggest to avoid is a grandfather or a grandmother.
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But it's because of affection.
You could say "my" because you're a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond.
The elderly people.
They have a name.
Like all of us.
Stereotypes stimulate them.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today, in Argentina, there are 6 million people older than 60 years, in 2050 there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And don't we want to see ourselves?
Neither accept ourselves.
If we collapse, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, to create jobs.
To design new products and services.
This new longevity.
It opens endless doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively for children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people to really understand their new needs?
Its new possibilities, desires, and tastes.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Thank you very much.
