I have a message for your children and grandchildren and I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
We need to learn to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lumbi Street, in Indonesia, 30 meters below the water, with that feeling of non-gravit√©s, turtles, molamous fish, fish from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a small fish of black and yellow folks, left from a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We had to look at each other and I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
I know what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he speaks to fish, right?
It's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them about it.
They look at each other and say:
The teacher is crazy.
But I'm not crazy.
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
The work of 24 hours during a week to draw that artwork we're going to see.
On the contrary, the maritime stream would take it.
It's a sentence we see, it proves that nature has awareness.
And that I'm not crazy.
And if I am able to talk to fish, would it be true that indigenous peoples from origins can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
And in fact, I bring you more scientific proves.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of 3/4 between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
According to Claiver's law, an elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse, but three quarters.
If you think about it, the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right?
So I ask myself: Is it a simple coincidence?
Or nature has an inherent awareness after thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unite the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of human beings.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should mimic and perfect to achieve a sustainable development.
And here you bring a summary.
(Laughter) And I remember with scientific consensus, with the explosion of Big Bang, the universe emerged 13,700 million years ago.
The planet Earth was formed between 4,500 and 5,000 million years old.
And the miracle of life between 3800 and 3500 million years.
During the first half of this period, the forms of going to Earth primogenites stayed in very simple levels.
And with the appearance of free oxygen and the atmosphere the first complex cells originated.
When the exclusion changes from the measures, the biological variety has increased at a great speed, creating a wide range of multisellular organisms that have developed survival strategies, with very specific energy flows, like, for example, the tropical chain.
The accident seems to indicate that life followed and the depths of the oceans, couldn't reach the Earth until 450 million years ago.
We're talking about the appearance of the dinosaurs of theoretical period, 66 million years ago, the hegemonic period of mammals started, where the first or puppy minds appeared later.
Thanks to fossil remains found up to echox, it is known that autolopites have about 4 million years.
The or Morectus are the two million.
Dentalise and homo sapis, two symptoms.
Currently, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that cohabits and co-evolves around the planet Earth, pointing to the rest of its rich biodiversity.
Since the agricultural revolution, since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a significant way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed, as something unbearable.
(Music ends) Specially between species.
A parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, one single species, one more unitian, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species.
And that is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
Human beings are still trying to destroy everything around them.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
Although it seems that we have forgotten of irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, to equate the thermal fusion of the stars, that can reach 65 million integrated degrees, and, if that were not the future generations, they are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we left in Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020, we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Forum of nature, if all of us, the whole citizen of the world, would imitate the models and life styles given in the US, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming.
And what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater and we fire the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources.
And they will be able to develop it in a dignified way.
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and pregnancy and excess of all forms in life, in nature, what defines, it's not competence, but cooperation.
Let me give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not the competition, but the symbolic union of having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life.
Cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the thermal body behind it.
Our body is a pluricellular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradogically, nature is the best way of imitating it and perfecting to reach sustainable societies.
After 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time.
It has suffered catastrophs of glaciation, meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
But human beings continue to create linear thinking ideologies, political doctrines, like anarchism, that failed communism, which also failed socialism, and capitalism has failed as well.
A study by Oxford last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than 99 percent.
That is to be crazy.
And that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick patologically and if cobalanced, because nature leads to economic benefit.
We have sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
bioimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
From my life, my great imitation.
The imitation of life.
But this is not new.
This is already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside all of us.
How do we do that college?
I invite you to play a game of imagination.
What happens to this wire?
How could engineers, architects, economists be inspired?
Well, they thought of making a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
The Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites, we could build bioclimatic buildings.
With this sun revolves, a plant of solar panels.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Therefore, bio-spiration is practically infinite.
Thinking that nature, but we are still there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP.
What does the country mean?
Many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb up a lot by economy levels every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw material for the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Imagine a future for dialogue with your children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me, "Dad, at least you tried it, you fought."
And you, what would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
And what I don't want to say is that the quarantine is our opportunity and gives it less an opportunity.
There are horrible things.
We talked about the quartery doing everything we lack, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, and economically, we went bad, socially as well.
Let's dream with friends.
It's all.
There's nothing to do with this.
And not because thinking that it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of and that we are not leaving something, but we take advantage of it and that it's a great moment to learn it.
I was very early.
It's not a horrible love.
In fact, life is not about anything else, it's horrible moments and learning about them.
We learn the pain of illness, we come from war, we sell from death.
We've always done it and we'll keep doing it.
So that's what we're going to do now.
What I had to think about entering is an idea in which I was meditating from a book called "Modern nature," so the cinema is right to the world.
There are two journals that have already taken me in the USA when they diagnosed with HIV and then he decides to return to his passion to childhood.
But that's not a filmmaker, in fact, later I'm going to diagnose, and it's a lot of very important movies.
It's more important for his career.
The linear decision is that they will buy a land instead of a horrible hospital and they will take care of a garden.
But what struck you, as a person writes you, is that for him, taking care of a garden was not time.
Well, spend the time, not like now that we spend the time cooking to San Pan or whatever.
Sharing.
The only thing we do is having a plate.
These are only tasks that are allowed to us.
Think about the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that opens maximum from Fredy Gengers, basically.
And that later I took particularly the feminist master to talk about reproductive work.
The productive work, the one that put new things in the world, can we say?
It's a first patio, a slap, it doesn't matter.
And it's a reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that: cleaning, cooking, taking care.
Basically, cooking the workers so the next day they'd put the factory.
Back for all the worst.
And feminist for a long time, since reproductive work is also work.
What we keep is that reproductive work has economic value, why is it useful to make productive work?
Because if workers don't eat, not in the factory.
Now, why can the humour of preserving in that relative value first of all we don't think of an absolute value?
It's even more, because we don't do it as Dinzuderex Hermann and think that this difference is contrasted between productive and reproductive work is a difference given by one side, of course, the gender, for the idea of eternalities that are important, these are the producers, for the important women.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that the original makes, the world in which the subject is.
If you care, care is something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you original, it makes you an artist, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't matter you.
These are values know, we don't have to accumulate.
I thought about looking for the other way around, even say it.
The care tasks are the most important.
Nowadays we are living without wrists and writers, a lot of taboo things.
I'm not seeing without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
The world hadn't been spinning without food.
And without care.
And without nurses.
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today is to eat and cure and clean.
What is the world of magic?
So, those tasks have a value that is not relative, they have absolute values.
Not only that, but cooking not only something mechanical that we have to go above, that hopefully didn't exist, if we could do this, clean almost.
You can't think like that, we've thought them for a long time, but what I thought when I read Germans is that I can also live them differently.
We can live them as tasks with wisdom.
These are tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical.
And that also has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modernity.
Society doesn't like the human being separated from the natural world that only does something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature is also something interesting.
Because it's taken care of our bodies, right?
In general, we think we have to take care of the body, the origin, we have to cook, only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
But that is also a very strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body.
To leave our mind is what we are and the body will do something that we have to overcome.
It seems that ... it's an opportunity.
And, in fact, at its point, I want to go back to my life.
In the world you don't need more soap operas and I want to write soap operas.
That's life.
We all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now, I thought, "Well, why not? Because the world needs more soap operas to connect with the world, with the body, with the care, with the others, and with doing all the school, and with all that, why not think instead of being obsessed with keeping being productive in these days, in a different way from that?
That's why, in fact, when I was invited to do this, I almost say no, because I thought I didn't have an intention of an original idea.
I haven't decided to see that the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought, in fact, we're going to write.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what was already there.
Be careful that I had with my books and that maybe it's useful to other people.
More than writing, reading.
Besides, what to do, be careful?
Thank you very much.
And when people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
Only bread, the sweetest, the most sterile.
It's enough every 15 days.
Hasado, an end of a half.
These foods don't get fat.
What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them.
That's why I want to name you three key aspects to have a good food: The first is consciousness.
Once a teacher told me, "Take awareness is high to brain activity."
With cerebral activity, experts lose on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take secondary awareness to our desires, we would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one who doesn't like the most.
And after that, we are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating and what amount.
A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, it's not hungry, it's hungry, it's hunger, and the most caloric.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
Forbidden has always been the most attempt.
And that diet and restricts, fast foods, are constantly thinking of pizzas.
What is it, dreaming, hug, a burrow with a double queso?
So, going back to the subject.
Are we really able to say pizza?
No, thank you.
They prefer a hole.
Impossible, right?
The second aspect is practice.
Coming, like all processes in life, you learn.
And in this case, and in many cases, my inclusion learns.
First, we're going to learn to eat in this station.
What does this mean?
First, the foods that were costed at that time.
This is going to guarantee us.
control and balance to our weight.
And that's why it waves our health.
Why?
Because the wealthy foods of their time are the most natural foods, they are the richest food in nutrients and they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
That is, they are not addressed with unnecessary calories for our body.
It was normal to see frutils all year long.
It's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism, led to practice, will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony of eating always the same.
And the last aspect that for me is not a small one, but it is one of the most important in moderation.
Those who don't have breakfast, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, they also give us auses to repeat the match plate with fruits.
To think, right?
So, what do I mean with this?
hunger gets accumulated.
That hunger isn't affordable if they restricted food, if they eat.
And what wasn't consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night, and in double split.
To make it more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top, increasingly its size, increasingly its volume and its strength.
So, if we don't stop every three or four hours to take a swing, that snowball will get out of a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat and we will unleash all the food that we have around us.
To finish, together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief, that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the slightest, I'll be, the more weight I'll lose and not.
The most expert body becomes a reserve, store, and when I mean reserve, I mean this, I mean this, to everything we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat, we get out of that ignorance.
The community can hurt you or can cure you.
It depends on us, about taking awareness, what are we feeding and in what amount?
But, the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation, such food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure, I propose you to eat rich, eat everything you like, eat variable, but always take care of the portion.
And there's no reason the phrase of "Sayuna como Ray", "Almourza como prince and dinner as mendigo."
I think many people know it.
health doesn't have excuses.
There I can't, there I don't have it, the hunger or worse happened.
She died of helplessness.
We have four opportunities every day to choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
A while ago I've been obsessed with stories of female scientists.
I love it.
The first one that was obvious to me was Marie Curie.
But they were awarded a Nobel Prize and they were given two.
So that deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things.
Recently, I learned about Eugenia's story to be a dote.
In Ogenia it was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
They made great contributions.
Among them, the most important thing was that the vaccine went against polio in the 50s.
And thanks to her, thousands of lives were saved.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
In Eugenia I work actively until 2004 and they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And you know what?
In 2011, I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
How did I lose it?
They gave me an idea to the rhythm that gave me.
And having found out of them recently.
A very brunk.
That's why I tell stories of female scientists.
To honor those who went, but above all, to not lose those who are there.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
We learned a lot of time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep going through a long time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
What does a new ortography need?
I think yes, what does it need or better?
Please, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They've been rooting from the century in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our orthography a very clear and simple principle, so we have to write how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound had to correspond to one letter, each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because the Spanish, unlike other languages like English or French, has always had a strong resistance to write too different than how we pronounce.
But it's not there, because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing there was another criteria that guided a lot of the decisions.
That other criteria was etymological, the one who says we have to write according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek.
And that's how we stayed with Hesmudas, whom we wrote, but we didn't say it.
That's how we stayed with velargas and decorations that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the forecastation of the Spanish.
And that's how we created Jes, who are sometimes aspers as people, and sometimes they replace their birds as a cat.
And that's how we stay with them, heces, filets, three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in two of them, but in none of three.
I'm here to tell you nothing that you don't know about your own experience.
All of us went to school, we all inversed large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that plastic, child-sized brain time, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules, full, however, exceptions.
They brought in many implicit forms and explained the idea that in ortography there was something fundamental to our training.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important.
They even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
Antography is used to uniform writing, so that we all write the same.
Therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example, in ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved.
In puntuation, yes.
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase.
With puntuation I can print a particular rhythm of what I'm writing, not with ortography.
Photography or is it good or bad depending on adjust or not the current standards?
So, wouldn't it be easier to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the right standards so that all that time we dedicate to ortography teaching can be dedicated to other issues of language whose complexity if they deserve time and effort?
What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that everyone writes whatever they want.
Longue is a common tool, and therefore I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
I also think it's fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest thing we can, above all, because if we simplify our orthography, we're not leveling downward, when ortography is simplified, we don't feel the quality of language at all.
I work every day with the literature of the 21st century of gold to the garbage, to servant, to gongora, I see, that sometimes they write men, without H, sometimes they write "mome" or "convention" or "de lack of convention" still at the time of them.
Not a good quality.
Let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story.
A while ago that insistence was mentioned a bit irreflexic with the teachers who hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the blame of raw, the educated of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is being written.
You can manage or stop getting a job by a H, who put it or stopped putting it.
It can't become an object of public mock for once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget that throughout our history, in our language, there were always teachers or individuals related to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reform, sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andr√©s Bello, promoted the highest ortographic reform that had indeed been place in Spanish language, which was the one in Chile, in the middle of the 19th century.
Because then not take the bet of those teachers and start advancing in our ortography.
Here, in our intimacy of the 10,000, I would like to put some modifications on the table that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's design Hemula.
That's where we wrote a H, but we don't say anything, we don't write.
Nothing, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone all the troubles that HMUDA cause us.
Velarga and Becort, we said before, they've never been distinguished in Spanish language, we choose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one has their preferences, each one can argue.
We want not with one, let's eliminate the other.
What a child, let's divide the functions, that people burn sound soft, cats, thin, thin, thin, and that the towel retain the sound "Aspero," "Pabe, giraffe, people, Argentinians."
This thesis is an interesting case because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle.
In some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended.
Now I said before, I know that Iceta, in some places corresponds to a sound in two to two, and of three letters, we lower two, we are all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic.
They are not that much.
The Spanish Academy Real, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified, and that sometimes the attachment to history, to traditions and customs, becomes an obstacle for today's use.
This explains it in fact that our language was much more than those we know, geographically close, it was modifying historically about us. For example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we were of quantity, we were from symbol to symbol, and little by little, now they start to remove, glue, some moved branches, in the dictionary of the Real to the academic, flour, harmony, they can write, or without H, and we are all fine.
And it also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
Men say that language spontaneously changes from below to top, which are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications and that the authority in some places is an academic in other places is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts and incorporates them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to below.
It was always the institutions that fixed the rules and suggested modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks, but at our time, the time of social networks, that is suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now, never so many wrote in the view of so many.
These social networks, for the first time, are looking at a large scale used by novelous orthography, where even people with impecable and perish orthography who write social networks behave quite similar to how most users behave in social networks.
That is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
Now there are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention, because they are probably telling us that a time that is assigned to writing, new criteria.
I think we would do bad to reject them, to disconnect them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decades of our time, no.
And I think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a more affairment standard with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we are going to lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic.
A simplified ortography, we will recover the etymology at the same place where we are now, the etymological dictatorships.
Second objection from those who say if we simplify ortography, we are going to stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter.
That's true, but it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring.
It was a huge majority of situations, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection, for me, the most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, which is the one who says, "I don't want to change."
I get hurt like this, I got used to this way when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "The eyes hurt me."
This objection is part of each one of us.
What do I think we have to do?
Making as it's always done in these cases, changes are carried forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're accustomed and wait for time to feel the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits is in the prudence of consensus, high level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive.
I think we have to agree that academies have to agree and clean our orthography all those habits we use because we receive them even though they don't serve us.
All of this is convinced that if we do that in the modest field, but important of language, we'll be leaving the next generations a better future.
(Applause)
Before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes, I had coffee eyes with an accomplishment around light and say to me, "Yes, don't hide your eyes."
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and death.
Maybe because of my training as a filmphotography, instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Surprisingly, all the scientists I approached andaugurated monocratic images, the discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
The whole universe inside my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became peace.
This image, do you see it?
This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
It doesn't make sense of disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence, there is perhaps in this reflection, we are caressed by the cosmos and that when we look at the mirror infinitely more than we believe.
The matter is not believed or destroyed, it becomes an adivine action than a thermodynamic principle.
Thank you!
(Applause)
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic and spatial technology.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
Why should we create an INBAP of education?
Imagine a public agency that designs and contents and strategies to transform learning, that works with schools, that develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence at a large scale.
A agency with teachers, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you. Why should this be blind of short-term logics?
They wanted to reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step is to think of the state as a possibility, not as the variable of all the others.
Just like that, education changes won't benefit the most advanced.
(Applause)
I'm not the scientist, and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
extraterrestrial inventions, from great shapes, even pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking more questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition, even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior, which seems and ridiculous, has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than with relevance, the answer.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
Why does failure live with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy?
It's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government in only 10 days had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
This gave a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology, called "the optimist section."
If we've just made many of us manage or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that nothing will happen to us in reality.
And it made the great politicians of Europe and many tropicators in the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but more moral or social.
Why does this happen to us now?
Unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmas.
For example, at the bobonia he went to the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States, when, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a series of rats, which were those who were really spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, in Japan we have to say that everyone uses more chairs.
The first thing makes people sick don't know it, don't count.
It's very important.
Maybe there's another reason, maybe more important, which is that if you use more stages we get sick, then this would be a sort of acusatory crossing.
To know who's sick and who's not because they use the most messed names.
That they use it all over the world is a way to avoid stigma and take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've found the most in these days is our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them.
The truth is that what we need is motivation to do something.
This is the Cubierta right now.
For years we thought education couldn't change and those things that were extremely difficult to change them.
However, in three days, all children are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the premature need.
And the world does revolve.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confin people at home.
What then seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
A dilemma, a caricature so we can think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization, but also governments and other public sectors, has the capacity through some technology to know where we are, where we move, to whom we find and also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our fold load, and can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of infecting and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this agreement can use this information to restore people's movement in a specific way.
The one in your son, if you stay home, the one that's not at risk can come out.
And we keep on this mental experiment imagining that with this we really increase the effect of the epidemic.
It disappears completely, but it dies in many fewer people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to give up our data, the risk they were a bad use of them is still true.
There's nothing free.
The question is: if you had the beginning of the pandemic and could choose if you feel good or bad to do this, what would you do?
And I chose this dilemma because I think it's a voice to the inevitable attention that there is, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe we give our data in a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact, to take care of us and everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, a luck lets freedom.
In this case, sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment: sex-computative sex.
When all this happens, what is the balance we want to get to feel at the same time free and care?
In the case, there will be fewer environments in a sky.
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we also realize that taking part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want anybody to be the conservative sex of coronaves.
My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old, on a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagone, Argentina.
I've been in museums many times, with salas full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
This was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nowhere, an animal I've lived millions of years ago and probably no one had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples."
Parents of the sea wounds and were very common in the seas invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment, I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
Nowadays, something about fossils I didn't know, are extremely fragile.
It began the sea dollar, it fell into the sand, and I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
I'm interested in fossils, my fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past, kept captivating me.
They went to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
And approximately 100 million years ago, our planet was very different than what it is today.
That it was so different that not only human beings existed, but the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
I told you about 100 million years of action, which is a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
For 10,000, these are 100 million, it's a number that doesn't enter into the head.
That's why, multiplying for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, it's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to have in our heads.
Well, life has led me to study how the world was like 100 million years ago, I've traveled some of them and I've studied fossils from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions.
Like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa, I saw fantastic fossils.
But it has also led me to a very special place, Patagonia.
And when we say Patagonia, we naturally think about these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountains.
But for us, pentologists, Patagonia is this: it's a wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
We don't have many dinosaurs in Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs.
Most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth, what we call the creature period.
Then approximately 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South Hemisphere, dominant carnivores, the most common cannels belong to a family called Velis√°urios, while for that time, in the northern hemisphere, other families of carnivores founded, like the tyrannosis of where the famous Tyrannosaurus belongs to.
This difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well?
What we call "the legal period", about 100 million years earlier.
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
It's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Claves, especially 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs for the first time completely dominated the planet.
The first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivorous carnivores of omnivorous worldwide.
We've been dedicating the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagonia's Law.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found four years in hills like these, walking.
One afternoon of much heat, after walking all day, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
I approached myself as I approached, it became more clearly what it was: it was the path of a dinosaur.
Because, to go somewhere, I shooled, I was really held.
I asked her what it was and at the same time I knew what it was.
We can study years of bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the tracker of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
I couldn't believe it really.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
He began to tell him the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task to protect the rest to extract it.
In several days we could cover it with bones caps, as we do to transport it to the museum, and we started to take it price below.
After the expedition was over, we didn't talk with the team, nor the time needed to seem a big excavation, and we had to go back to the museum until the next season the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition.
We needed to open the excavation and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day of the stadium, we realized that the complete skeleton was in this dinosaur.
It's very rare in the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
During the animal was dead, at the rings of a lake and had been covered by fine clay layers, preserving in an intact way its beskeleton.
The excavation begins, really: to throw it away, layer, those sediments that were burning where it opened to us.
It's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time that it's returning to the surface a animal that lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Llenemal had to have died, he had to have covered by sedentary layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers.
This food was transformed into food rocks and in that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Afterwards, all that buried rocket had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a warming of this whole block.
In the rain and the wind had to erosion these layers, layer, layer, until we started discovering the layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those mistakes searching for those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting to discover the judges of a new species completely unknown until then.
It's a long work that lasts for hours and hours under the sun, the patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we could carry all this rest protected by bones to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another extremely long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain all the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
When the anatomy of these remains we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizardia, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before what we thought.
Much before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate being due to a big ocean.
The moment of mess, when all the continents were united in a big supercontinent.
But not all discoveries follow this trajectory.
In some discoveries we really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transported to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside us and after nine months of work in the lab we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was contained in those rock blogs.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
The teeth in the form of hand and that's why it opens up and we call them "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very special, in addition, because of something very special, one of the smaller dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
The very, very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton.
The project wouldn't bring more than 50 feelings from the end of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur minis didn't look at all the forms we contracted or knew of the northern hemisphere.
Studying their remains we could see that their closest relatives had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean is still not formed that separates these two continents today.
But once again, we had a case of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the North Hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern, and this led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived in this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region.
And also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time.
Ridering the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment in Pangea, where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic.
I was observing the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It's a great guy what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere.
That is, the lack of water, what had isolated these vaccines.
It's a desert full of water.
Actually, when we think about dinosaurs and we find fascinating things that have their anatomy, we realize that they are really fantastic, fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of the body size, the history of life, have diversified and achieved those of all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing is that they take us to understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
We, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in rocks, that were formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written over 4.5 billion years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
Millions of pages still to read about this book.
And if we really want to know our planet, its poems, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays, it's crucial to know its history.
To know the past, it's key to understand the present and it's also key to project a future.
Great!
(Applause)
And many of us, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers.
Dissiping what would later read so many books and see so many movies, I dreamed of healing and having magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
After a while, it gives us a reality bathroom.
Sometimes you get the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Larry Potter.
It's empires to invad small villages and you don't have the position of pass√°mics to defend them.
But something of that childhood vocation remained in me and almost without realizing my whole life, I dedicated myself to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work, are not my imagination but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers.
And perhaps, the most important thing in this situation that you have to live, what is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better.
Today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas.
I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main one of all ideas.
Just like the zero idea of this that I'm going to tell you.
We are able to learn.
Our ability to think is not given nor fixed, but it can be developed, but it can be developed, powerful and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look at those on the floor, parents of these brickets, fixed bikes.
If you turn around half, you go to the bar, you have a coffee with milk with 3 months of student from Manteque and they eat them.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't improve it.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What I want is to think.
We have to practice, think.
But take us the habit of thinking.
Let's make time to think.
Intelligence is not something you have or you don't have.
Is it something used or not?
The second one: the saying that the one who only sees a milelet sees in all the problems as a clou.
But if we have to pull a ring, a random is useless, or take into account of its bowl.
We have a ring, we need a defeat.
If we need to cut something, we need a greet.
A box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
The mental tools are called mental models.
If we only have a mental model, we'll think about all the problems with this model, as if we were trying to get 2,000 with a lot of being.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where are those mental models?
We take off and take them out.
We find ourselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the ancient Egypt three thousand years ago before Christ, in the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
No, all the problems will show us a slap.
Third: Recently, he was at the club and at the side table, a man told his friends, after his son and his classmates, who told him about the entire soccer teacher for a mistake the teacher had committed.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told the teacher.
He didn't realize that by saying this he was generating a much bigger evil in his son.
I was leaving him like a bone in front of his friends and he was detegitiming the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn from him.
Many times, we don't realize that being focused on winning on a scale, we don't have success on that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another more important scale.
It was a discussion and losing friendship, for example.
Making money, trying freedom.
It's freedom and losing love.
With the ratio, let's think about the most important scale we're going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act.
We just had to learn that the essentials were invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
Feelings make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
Those acts generated impression, generated emotions, and made us act.
They began to come images of Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China, those expressions generated emotion, fear.
In fears it generates action, that we are all now affected preventively what is very good.
That's why we were lucky that fear gave us time because it happened to someone like us before.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
azar is one thing.
In hunger, at home, you have an immediate reward, you eat what you married.
But very different farms do the effort now for something you'll take advantage of within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
Prevention creates applause because it is avoiding something that no one is delicious, but saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel, that is, develop our ability to anticipate, is one of the main skills of thinking well.
How do we make a minute?
We don't have to anticipate now that we still feel, we live.
In the fifth, we all evaluate things according to our expectations.
Something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last six months, we're happy.
Something bad, it lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, they're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
We programmed to run 10 km, for example, at 9 km, we are exhausted.
We programmed to run 20 to 9 km, we are unthinkable.
We have a point of resilience.
The key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
So, it's and last, has it ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a trouble place?
Walking through a little town in the middle of the ship!
A high school classmate that would not be 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
But the truth is that finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But, as we know so many people, it's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
So, with the rest of life it's the same.
There are so many unbelievable things that happen to us.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the unlikely is impossible.
Hello everyone.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future.
We don't know what will happen.
But now, not even in the most normal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
Or the intelligent way of coexisting when uncertainty is always leaving many open doors.
Not to think just about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible to serious things, even if it's very likely.
If someone ever asks you why you always have a car with the Nastalleno tank, answering, that why once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world with a high school classmate you didn't see 15 years ago.
That is to say, the principle I designed at zero of this talk, most importantly is to develop our ability to learn.
But learning has to do with being at risk.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking and people with whom we cultivate these ideas.
We could be people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's the attempt to change our own ideas.
An interview Borges 40 years ago, the interview asked a question.
And when Borges replied, the interview said to me:
So he answered that same question four years ago.
Borges kept quiet, looked at him and said: "I'm sorry, I haven't had much time to think about this subject for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limited moment of living to be accepted of new ideas, of the new ideas that are emerging and always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to emotional disorder, that's why they need the cost of a man, which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father.
And if you learn well, you will get a good husband you'll have to take care of.
(Laughter) This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about the marriage that circulates throughout the whole planet in different translations in the 19:30s.
But the idea itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize.
It's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Applause) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979.
36 years ago.
Many of you here had already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school that just in 1965, 50 years ago, is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The Princeton university just in 1974.
And we could continue and continue.
This was this idea that women only use to create children and help their husband, who is an irraational being, a cisteric being, was a truth in fact a century ago.
The same women believed it.
There were 1800 million people in the world, at that moment, and almost all of them, taking 5,000 perhaps, believed this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century?
Moreover, in the last 50 years, it's when it changed.
Because we are living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture.
We are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm.
It's a revolution that all political revolutions we've experienced in economics, if letters are nothing beside this one.
We are putting aside the idea that truth is true to the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this.
We can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not everyone, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that it doesn't exist in facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium, that interpretation is subjective.
interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretive framework?
What day am I?
September 4th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
Well, we're convinced it's September 24th, because all of us here agrees with the Greek calendar.
But if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the calendar 500 or more that exists, on September 24 wouldn't make any sense.
Every thing we say, every thing we think, every aspect we put is part of a very hard social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
Cats live without calendaries.
My dog, yap, an archator, and the one who is very alone at home, causing some misfortune, I didn't know the time, I didn't know when I had to come back.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world that would be maybe and little more stimulation, but surely the world we would live in wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind.
They taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at an apple falling, and wrote the law of gravity.
Genium.
But it's not how ideas arise.
Ideas appeared at that time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
And the trips had passed, to know the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
In addition to discussing the investigations that were accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and the press.
In the 13th century there was not even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The wisdom, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, or has never been born, but if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the task of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we're thinking now.
No, what we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation, that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field, change is revolutionary.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
And yet, in less than 100 years, half of the scientists have gone to govern countries today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women.
Look at all creative energy that humanity was lost to think of the way women were not useful for anything but for cleaning kidneys.
How much was humanity lost?
How many medicines?
How much intelligence?
How much creativity?
Because the wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can follow it because it was created a century and a half ago and that model to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say: "But how?
They arrive, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things.
And there yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both peers and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you today, have always existed in all culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But it had never thought that the sexuality of an abyss, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally.
Sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent.
It was the moment of the generation of the victorian moral, one of the greatest forms of social control over a century and the strongest ones that existed.
The same thing to turn into the empeced sex of the Catholic Church, when it proibdes to something we want to do, there are no turbines.
You'll do it with guilt, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to be guilty.
(Laughter) It's not true, fault is yours.
It's a huge social control.
(Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it.
This is a terrible social control form because it dominates us doublely.
On the one hand, do you know we can't leave, it's as if they deprived us of eating?
We can't stop eating.
That's why we're all agree.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong, the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Sexs during a century were terribly harassed all over the world, they didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, right?
Or that the Jews, or that the blacks, without leaving the slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of sexual friends, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews.
None of the situations today is ideal, but we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago, 50 years ago, that 20 years ago.
Ten years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood, this was just getting up now.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be fusilated.
But in many parts of the world today are completely legal.
This was possible for the change of paradigm and why this paradigm change allowed the fight of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed, assumed their identity, to be respected, and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have a full right.
But there's a drama of social fights and you have to get into jail that discriminated me.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman.
Look for me to respect me as black, just black and the same thing as gay.
And the gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people.
Maybe I don't want to cost as a guy, what do I know?
However, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, jail, and jail.
(Applause) Five years ago, look how old I am, I was a homosexual child.
I didn't know what it was to be a homosexual child.
What's more, I didn't know the word homosexual and they didn't say me that way either.
My schoolmates told me, "Sure, we're going to hit you."
(Laughter) "OK, don't look at me."
(Laughter) And I didn't even know what it was to be a troop, nor Jordopusto, or homosexual, or anything.
At the same time I knew that this caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was.
I went back home, from school, and I saw my father, who loved me, looked at me and made me feel what I would have done wrong so that I could go out like this.
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Assuming the identity that is, had the positive side, I learned to make myself respect.
I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black people too, they would have learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got into a terrible prison, which was to make 24 hours out there.
I stopped being a person, and I am a person, like any other person in the world, I'm against dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn that I am also a good person.
That is to say that I am complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
In 20 or 30 years this idea that had been having, that comes from understanding that facts don't exist, that exist ... (Applause) interpretations, there are no contradictions and it's going to say.
Because that's really what we are contradictory.
There are no facts, contradictions exist.
And contributions are also interpretations.
There are no facts, interpretations exist, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume staying there to defend myself.
And now I want to leave, I said, and when I faced it, because when an idea is incarcerated, it doesn't move, while we have it on our heads, it's not useful, I made it body, I left prison, and I left prison.
Was it so wonderful?
Did you think what prison are you in?
(Applause)
After that, or they told me, there's a list of things we need to survive, called the basic canasta.
What is the idea?
Living constantly with this rough.
Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to survive.
What if it had the things we need to explore?
But exploring is something difficult, landing.
Every moment, person and place, are completely different.
The constant movement leads us extraordinary situations.
Adapting is a long or small moment full of confusion, where a storm is created and everything you know how to disappear.
When everything I did, I erased by someone else's voices, you, I'm not even in a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas and besides all those ghosts that blame it.
But once you say it, once you get to get rid of your words, an avalanche and ideas that live towards you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain and you are about choosing, seeing your paraguas and covering them, or doing a side and your dad has each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy, of following, of returning, jumping, or running.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated.
Learn to damage your own movement.
A class is not bad.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, the movements.
Designs that take us to moments.
Moments in which you don't stop laughing.
These are moments that keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
Remember that maybe you won't be an artwork, but you will allow you to review the way you saw that face when I spoke about what I loved the most, the speed was what was going to your heart, or how you broke when you spoke.
That forest that knows you so much, that knows that I'm probably looking for something.
That voice, your best friend, is enough to be there forever.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little pile to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that ready shore to jump for you when you need it.
That person is a best friend, a microphone, a couple ofaguas, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend.
Without it is a mechanism, I cannot survive.
(Applause)
Because we created in girls cities, I'm sure that we ever choose, there's no chance to get out.
Who is not pleasure?
A little like this, an published suit.
I can't progress in the way I would like to.
Let's see!
(Laughter) But well, we remember that all the past was better.
Is this really what happens?
Maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
Think about this inevitably, I remember my friends of all life and Juancho, ranch and Manuel.
This photo you're seeing here is from 2009 when I see high school thing.
What can I say to my friends?
But I really want that, as they didn't count on the necessary resources such as being able to stay like to be able to study what they liked, and be surprised, until today, they can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
Meanwhile, I am the port in this photo, the mark of the absence of opportunities was also present.
My parents, who are workers, made an effort on human beings so that I could study what I liked, because I knew that if I stayed here in the city, I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be short of opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
Children in the middle of the 20th century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, where successes and progress are as a speed that surprise us all and collapse the borders and the barriers that exist among people.
In this context, cities are becoming increasingly more important.
We are going to be honest, they are our home.
And we created them and recreated them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that, in 2050, 68% of the world population will live in a city.
If that number doesn't sound, it should be almost feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven out of every ten.
If more and more people choose to live in cities it means there are places where we have more chances to progress.
What is the reason why, while weapons cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everybody wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them?
Here I'm going to tell you a key word I wanted you to go to Gab√° when you come out of that door to get home.
Strange!
If we want globalization to help us in the city to find more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
Part of my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships happens precisely by this, by connecting cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminate way, but assenting our strengths, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you may ask: How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through the concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population and avoid migration towards other places in search of a better future.
Once again, inevitably, I remember them, my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, so you can see a couple of things.
First, we joined a fifth friend Philae in the group.
Do you know what it is?
There was not something in the case.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of investment relationship is given.
The idea that improves the quality of the photos of the phones, what was moving and washing of improving.
(Laughter) Some of them have a couple of kilos more, we have to keep them in half waiting, but do you know what we share until today, beyond the deep hacker we have each one for us?
The mark of the missing opportunities.
I work, for example, which is right right in this picture, was a national champion of geography loneliness in 2012.
A national champion.
Nowadays, although you want to detect a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday working, simply to be able to live.
After these lettuces they grow up that I'm the strongest left.
He can't go to his place.
I wanted to study something related to the defense field to be able to enter one of the security forces in the best country.
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, since then, changing my career without being able to find what he really was patient.
And I can't even get a job that allows the seven economic independences.
Finally, it's Manuel, a computer genius.
But the geniuses don't know.
He sees it anything.
But in account, every day working in his place that built from nothing itself, he goes to university to study programming, because he can't develop his potentials and continue learning what he likes, and he cannot develop his potential for the lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
What we see about all this I'm telling you is that we, as young, have nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
Do you know, recently I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a selected group of 8 young units worldwide to participate in a weekend in New Delhi, the capital of India?
In representation of Argentina I was the only Argentinian in that event and besides saying it was an incredible experience.
I mean, my head fell away.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I'd like to share with you, there are millions that I will never be able to say this with sufficient emphasis for you to have millions of opportunities outside for all tastes and colors.
But you have to be willing to find them, they don't come alone.
In 1o 2, but not less important, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I don't have the ability to come young, the US, nor the children, nor anyone.
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
They have a state present to come out to the world and bring opportunities to them so they can develop them.
Once again we found better cities.
We act strategically to the world.
I remember, when I arrived at Rosario for the first time I found myself to go to study, with three days to turn 18.
They were me, it has no results, with a lot of fear.
This can never be said in public because it's very difficult, but all those around me know for all that I had to happen.
It was hard to leave your city, which is to play.
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
For this to happen to you and your friends, not to anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
In the end, the lovely one stays lying to the city that will come to you.
And with a strategy we can do.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been if it had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or how much if today they were in one of the security things in our country?
Or to not go so far away, in Manuel, if you had the necessary programs to keep on going to what you like.
Yes?
Yes!
That's how we see the lack of opportunities.
And yes, all that I desperate telling you doesn't seem enough argument and they want another example, look.
And I didn't see him.
This is the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I was able to overcome the deep mental depression in which I cried a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop happening, we have to go out strategically.
On the other hand, we don't eat a final point to our cities.
Thank you very much.
It's a surgeon.
We have always thought that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In the last 10 years, my research, in my case in the sofa, was based on searching for reasons to operate less and less for patients.
That can be done in several ways.
What we do, for example, looking for genes to detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair by themselves by using their own ability to regenerate.
We do this with biological platforms, which are like maps we give to the tissue to use their own ability to restore themselves after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies, we can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before we had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks.
What seemed like science fiction previously, today is almost daily, it's amazing.
Undoing my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate gave me a lot of satisfaction.
And there are a lot of patients that prevented having to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized that developing less and less invasive methods, I have more and more work.
(Applause)
I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese.
And in my work for many years I've had contact with literary, sociological and anthropological questions of Japanese culture.
I believe that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
What is making us a first question?
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium if it was in January the first case?
Being in Japan, so close to China and identified, having almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space, with almost 130 million inhabitants until now.
We know this new virus runs a very contagious virus.
In these demographic data, Japan introduced us a cocktail that would enable a great propagation of disease.
Basically, many people in little place and a quarter of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in a way that responds organically and united to any event that compromises it.
It went through wars, tifons, tsunami.
The lake receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 earthquake per day.
Generation, after generation, has had to overlleve natural disasters contained by humans.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
A soccer team will have better performance in a critical moment.
A team that training every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained, who has no infrastructure, who has to go out to improvise.
The directives are associated with their own house, the Japanese population has established it with social and hygiene and individual behavior for hundreds of years.
You don't need to say no to embrace yourself, not to give up because you don't do it.
that waves with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
We don't have to indicate not to stubborn or stubborn on someone else, because this is a habitual protocol between the Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use noise when they feel rolled, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message in a collective culture.
The good of all is more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that two Western teachers did in a Japanese school.
You'll surely know the sillas' game.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get one out of each round.
Has this experience been done in Japan?
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, were all sedating the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
All the Japanese word expresses this way of being.
It's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me.
In resonance, allow us to perform when we take care of others.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works.
It helps itself, because every Invism contributes to the good of everyone.
