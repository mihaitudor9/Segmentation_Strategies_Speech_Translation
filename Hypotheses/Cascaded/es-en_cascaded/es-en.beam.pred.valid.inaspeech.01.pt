Let's look for them again.
Do we generate it?
From the retirement of the Partiosa.
We had a vision.
Let's do it!
The cell phone, the instrument we make.
Protagonist.
Our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play it.
So that you sound.
And it's power there.
What did we have to sell to work in reality?
It's called by video, each one records their part.
That's how the other can play by themselves.
And that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this material.
Perfect.
(Applause) Therefore, we don't even have what Mar Sophen is.
It's really that.
So, I get sick.
A: And relatives are those who don't recover.
What this time?
They cry it.
They wake up to see a stance.
But there's another thing that this pandemic comes to me.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the content of social networks and fighting them with information.
But during the pandemic, the Olympic.
In 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
A: But its consumption, its global penetration.
It's a good guy besides.
The pandemic, COVI-19 is the first pandemic that lives with infodebies.
What is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called me with Materda.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
(Sigh) misinformation is always dangerous.
We don't know, but when it comes to health issues it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can put in danger, is our lives directly.
(Sigh) I don't know anything about an idea.
Of the amount of waste.
that circulate these days on Facebook, on Instagram.
And you on Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they may not agree with a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
Four weeks ago with my team.
We lower it.
without rest.
I have fake news.
Diggers.
Do you see measures?
that circulate over this new disease.
I know what, we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this balance of information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they're frustrated.
(Video ends) That's why I think it's useful and I tell you what we discovered, something we found.
All the contents.
Impulated to COVID-19.
Let's encourage.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that by telling them it will be more prepared.
The other categories are simple: The first one has to do?
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Competative theories they say.
What?
A pioneering action of two Chinese scientists stole them in Canada until a English lab created this virus in 2014.
If you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus.
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category relates to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading in a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate only to open the window, that's not like that.
There is no sound evidence.
The third category is related to fake news.
Treatments and courts are the most dangerous, it's the one that has to pay more attention, the one that has to force them to be more careful.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making us drinks with hot water and salt or making vapor is drunk to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
That he was able to generate it and there was no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications, but at the moment it doesn't have a fully satisfying answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, or to the reach of different measures to the disposits of authorities, without the farther in Argentina, the day it was expelled.
The preventive and obligatory social isolation, 15 days ago, or a little more, a failure of credit circulated that said that Whitentena started the 3 of the afternoon.
And it obviously generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And so?
It makes us fear, that not only we'll have to be.
Together in our homes, but in communications.
But disinformation is generally.
They try to create panic.
And it scares us.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health organization or the Ministry of Salud, unfies.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate ourselves.
To bite, cheat, and label.
(Sigh) Why?
We're not good.
No doubt.
We're not comfortable.
When we lack certainty.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
And if you receive a content, isn't checking?
Let's replace it...
I begin with doubts.
It's so common.
I don't share my doubts.
That is taking care of our ego.
(Laughter) If you receive a content.
Of someone.
And discover what they do?
Take streets.
How did he turn around?
Confirmation.
And with smell.
And if you share a content and then you realize.
What fake?
Not having boxes.
Excuse me.
And when you act.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day, science works intensely to get the cure.
But that's it!
And it needs time.
Hundreds.
There are evidence and information vaccines.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
That if we fill those empty with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
Let's be.
Much worse.
What if we tolerate them?
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I learned that...
Working is a means of pain.
Of other people.
It doesn't make you an amerged person, nor sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle.
In an act of reconciliation.
Sorry.
of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool.
It allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness.
insecurity.
And fear.
that generate the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty, to be more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
And when despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more adverse than ours.
And that allows you to put it on.
Your own problem as perspective.
Finally.
I learned and I continue to learn.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, is it about relating?
And to accompany.
Cultivate love and compassion.
They help confront suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate.
Love and compassion.
You can lie down.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Good afternoon, (Applause) I turned 40 years ago.
After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more personal topics.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why when a man is introduced?
It's enough for her to decide, "Hi, I'm Mr. Durant, I'm a writer.
For a woman, like me, I have to decide goodwar, I'm a writer.
And I'm a woman.
But why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
(English) I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
AC: It was a very written topic in many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
We can remember approximately that half of humanity is men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity is masculinity, so why are we asked to be more women and the other half is feminity?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry.
At 40.
I am really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations to a man.
It's enough to walk in the street, to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
who walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist on women in our society.
(Laughter) But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
(Video) I studied biological, physiological issues.
Technology.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, man is everything, in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Women?
It's the other, the other.
Women.
The second sex.
It's the second sex.
Women are not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity.
That it's all.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Excrued as blacks, excluded as projectmen, or Jews.
DB: But among them there is a community.
They say "us" they identify themselves.
However, women.
They don't identify themselves easily.
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name?
What about a black woman?
A funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
What about a projectory?
And women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live dispersed inside a group of men.
Anything.
Aren?
It is quite satisfying to believe and feel the king of creation.
BB: Until anti-feminists.
Did they work?
Teories in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
(Laughter) In philosophical discussions.
Many men usually ask me.
A: Do you wish that because you're a woman?
(Laughter) Of course, as if for having ovaries and uterus, the rule and hormones would take me any objectivity.
AC: As if they wrote their theories, they didn't have their hormones and their teronous texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
(Laughter) And inside everything I told you, I studied biology and physiology, etc.
And I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Audience: Great!
Nature is that?
Society doesn't dictate, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
A woman is not born.
It gets to be done.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds, it was a complete, integral individual.
And many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
Don't you think about it?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Possau.
To have children, to dedicate them to creating them.
Men explains that everything is natural to them, therefore.
(Video) Your feminity resembles that.
(Laughter) I don't want to change the female condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
Well, what I do intend.
Are we aware of that?
Let's see, raise awareness of these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
AD: With the pre-companied ones.
What I want to share.
And every man is that every woman and every man.
He can and must decide what he wants for his sexuality.
A: Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to conscientize.
That this is effort.
AC: You have to do it together, among men.
And women.
What I want is to conscientize.
AD: That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
Well, then.
A: We will live in a society.
Complete.
It's powerful.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
Thank you!
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Anastares, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the taste, which is a hell in search of freedom, or a hell that talks about the thoughts that thoughts are like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And at the end, he says: "And these thoughts for them to give them?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote, supreted in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as his own.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home.
(Laughter) Because I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Applause) A couple of years ago, a group of friends from my school went out to marry for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my other, and to be able with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them?
I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
He came with me to Congress.
And I still remember his face when we got there.
I look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
And I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of books and movies on teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter's work, the games of hunger, divergent, the genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all of them?
There are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And in all of them?
There are teenagers.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a distopy.
It's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change.
Where we, young people, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where you do a death bag.
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
In the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
AC: Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobos comments.
Or by discussing political things.
And as long as many people prefer to avoid these topics to not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
I guarantee that there are certain things worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why a relative of mine makes a macho comment.
I'll discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or the legalization of abortion.
I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion and I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
I think of these things.
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that, opinion, is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
And to resguard our present.
I hope that more and more we start to see markets and political spaces in general, not as dangerous as it scares.
but as a space of personal growth and social growth of union and inspiration, and I hope there's always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly.
And to say, without any surprise.
It's full of kids, thank you very much.
Can you imagine having to walk for hours a day?
Taking a cup like this one.
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
It was like that of contamination.
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes.
And we will all have to face the future.
This is how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN.
who attended the day by global action by water, a couple of days ago in more rocks.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings, we.
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the manantial lakes.
Through agriculture.
of our big companies.
Even our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
Five?
Children per day.
According to the World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people in 2016.
They live without access to drinking water in the world.
And this implies.
Why if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth at least two?
Are there serious problems?
To have access to water.
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
Because this continent has 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular.
We'll realize, going to the country, for example Peru, sorry.
What is octavo country with largest hydroe reserves in the world?
They have at least 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico.
Fronether with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump now wants to build a wall, that is even closer to these two countries.
Almost 20 million people.
In other words, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth?
They meet in front of this situation.
In this pinete, it's a filter that works almost like in Peru, which, as you can see, represents a expense of enormous resources, that we make the bags, to return to the world, we put our hands to the work, starting from the base that we weren't experts in matter, water, and in this pinete, but always, to take it or buy it directly.
(Laughter) By leaving only clean water, retaining in 99, contaminated water passes by the end, older than with a water molecule... (Laughter) contaminated water goes by the end.
It's the oldest system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately, and in addition, it's a completely revolutionary system, if we consider that only the weight of water to make it work here, can you imagine the empire of these painters in the lives of all these people, okay?
We want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story, Leo Cruz, a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Yes!
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he and all his Puebla.
It was already in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the candy of which was supported, was very polluted by stakeptical stages around it.
To our move.
Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine it.
The illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on.
More than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua.
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
You will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatherban Project Tanzolera was an idea.
Well, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But in this dream, we were never alone, before leaving?
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign, which was destined to 100% of exclusive purchasing.
Of the water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
Together?
We have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
It can be one of the risks, of the greater risks.
To the one facing the human being.
In the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
So?
We asked ourselves the question of...
How is it possible to have reached this situation?
And the reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We have created a lot of necessities that we all know are unnecessary.
That sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
So, what do you think they are doing?
For those land, the great oil producers.
The big oilfield.
So that all of us can fill our vehicles' deposit.
What they are doing here is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there.
And it's amazing.
And they are making the communities have to be displaced.
And in the future this is what will probably cause.
It's that it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible.
And living it hasn't left us.
What has left us out of what is open.
I mean, it's really something that...
And we really think it seems.
That it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality that isn't only.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality that, November 12, 2016.
It's affecting us directly and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far.
In California?
With a world of technological development.
And they are mutating people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
A Spain.
In Spain we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
The more water houses will suffer in the future.
If it really is.
We want to make a change if we really want.
We want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is to all be aware of ourselves.
What we all have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
And with that, what are the solutions?
That they will really be sustainable.
What we have to do.
It is to support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption, that small NGO.
They are trying to build powers in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try to exercise a bit of pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really be?
Making change.
The life these big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value.
The amazing luck we have.
To reach our homes.
To take water pride.
And always, there's always water.
Or it's not like that.
Please, let's stop mourning this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
But we have to act, we have to raise awareness and act.
And we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Well, luckily.
There are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
A game, how nice it is for here.
The Nobel Prize, so many expensive, attentive.
Why?
I started the conference making a commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
That emotion has a power a thousand times higher than the thought, the electromagnetic frequency that generates a thought is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, speak from the heart."
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
If you open your heart, you will surely receive 1000% of what I'm going to say.
So we got stuck in our minds.
We certainly received only one part, so that's my commitment. To start the conference, ask a quick question, above all the front lines, to put ourselves in context. How is society today? Raise your hand and tell me three or four answers, quickly?
It stopped.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
A car accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you gave me the answers.
You just asked, and then there's another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy.
And no!
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
There are around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are?
What are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they'd always told us more or less questions, they would have told us in that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we're accustomed to the media, information.
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids' diary and we tell them, "Be good news, bad and neutral news, day money," right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Now, that's it.
This is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes on fashion, when I ask this once football is said, basket, rugby, not well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, which are in fashion today, the first, national sports.
The complaint.
We complain absolutely everything.
They saw it, that is, first we leave the weather: heat that's 3rd of January 3 pm. Oh, how crazy!
What cold is that 7th of July 7 am, cousin we leave the weather, then we leave the traffic, then we leave the country, with whom we call my wife, and if we don't complain about something, something is wrong?
When they ask me, "How are you perfectly good? It's a joy dish? What happened to you?
"You don't complain about anything."
In other words, we have become a society that is "joologists."
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change this, it's a disaster, or this has to change.
We have to change the country, society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into claims, psychologists, claims, and the maximum, or pinologists and all achievements.
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
Some of you have heard someone who says: "I don't feel the ability to operate this."
When we get rid of everything, it's already produced with my friends. There's a friend Fernando who goes up to the t-shirt with him and I say to him, "You see, without drums in that place, do you know why you stay without drums because he got up the soup?"
You understand that pain is going down there, because we know everything, we choose economy, politics, and...
And there's something even more worrying: we've started to have our mind oriented to the crisis.
We complain, complain.
We are immersive in opinion, what does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You have to leave our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also have a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy there was.
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
We need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was a little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and watch with the rhythm, which wonderful day, and the ring says to me: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced rain."
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society, especially in our generation, that we have left, our society in the moral crisis, which wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents, could imagine, faced, breathed, but of bad, are we making our children believe?
I think we're left for nothing, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
We don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how this quote "I" as we are the architects,
And what do you want?
We're in Argentina.
We hear this and if it were worldwide, be it, and what can we do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived complaining, which was hell.
That talent...
It was important, I had to have talent, I had to experience and I became more and more engaged in this, I saw that all of them add together, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude ...
Multiplicates.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimist guy, you are a heavimist guy, and if you have a merde attempt, he does a sort of merd.
Sorry.
So I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude?
How to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I would do.
Who searches for the changes I wanted to see?
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justifying, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the protagonist of an installation is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And me, and do you know what here, in this square meter, I vibrate in the energy I want to vibrate?
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why I go with one.
Aisa that says "free."
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to live in a different world, because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I was going to solve it and I told him, "Dear, give me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was hell and I was in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
If we'll always be waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's just one.
With the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So you're already in the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things, and the protagonist of those people in change, is not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because you know that with the people you gather, you contagiate, and you're with a pessimistic group, it's a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, you're failed, if you're in a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy, if you start with your square meter to contagiate solidarity or yourself, you start to emit that energy, why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco was to buy a kilo of side, one would say it, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Felices" and she tells me: "These people were born and I the first one I did is happy and it's nightcuting."
And I tell him, "Hey, you told 300 happy people, Pacoa."
"No, she says, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What are you up to?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, what is emitting, what is it that does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you get, this is like MMS, if you are in AM and you go from one AM point to the other side, you will listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody.
And what's more, at FM, having the frequencies you want to hear, you can choose, but if you're in ADM, even if you leave from one end to the other, you're going to listen to it.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first game is against me."
"Oh, I'm up, I don't get up."
Well, I wake up, you sing with humour, or with good humor.
With bad humour or not, with good humour, well-disposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence or media creates, this difference, the path that you take is a blind as you get up, those victims or protagonists.
You're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come or you're going to make the interests that today are governing us and taking us from domesticated noses, people are lead by fear.
My father told me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Great!
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to share two life experiences with this foundation of acts and borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To discover what we did last week, we gathered veterans of Argentine and Vietnam war, a british marin, a burk, and gathered Argentine competitions and they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
It was forbidden, that a measuring unit is her.
If they taught me that they were the bad guys and now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a blind is born.
I invite you to see it and I'm going to tell you two life stories.
I had the blessing of living with the Markuy Foundation without Borders, it was, in 2012, I went to work soja of gas to a conflict between realities and prestigations that had been 70 years old.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
And I understood that all the time I was worried about what I was missing, and one morning I saw a Palestine woman was the city of Belén, sees and embraces with other ladies and celebrations, no and celebrates, so I said, "What are you celebrating?
So the translator tells me they filled the water tank.
What does the scenario before water, that has drinking water at home to take the whole week?
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
They celebrated it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
Do you know what the lamparad's genius is all through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
So I'm going to explain to you what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her, "I work with you, what do you ask me?"
The little boy looks at me all emotional and says:
To have my hot water bathrooms.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment.
I was connected all the time with what I lacked.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
She would be able to give a bathroom, she would have...
Where to sleep?
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
It stopped me from being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state, that we are now.
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step.
I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
If you close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never give them.
Valor, we don't give them importance, in fact, having a place to sleep, to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
It's like our senses, our friends.
A lot of things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do.
So all the people in this room have it.
Now you feel, what have you been?
And...
Being born or selected or chosen by all they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until now, who express that gratitude.
(Applause) Well, what's up there, well, very well, for what we have, clapping standing up, applauding it stronger, that can shout, for the love of our dear loved ones, for what we get, what we get, what we get, very upwards, they can shout, they can join the chairs, they can do what you want, for the things you've received in your life, if you feel it right now, from this moment, and clapping strong.
The longest way to go?
There are four stadiums when we get rid of our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
This that we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Remember that...
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
The genius of the radin lamp?
He asks what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
To musicalize is to awaken the inner world and share it with others, and you don't need to be an instrumentist or be a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why because music is already in us since we are born in beats, in poths, in rhythms?
(Sigh) Do you know the sound?
But music also lives in pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a player.
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, so that we can all go together and grow in community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
(Laughter) Welcome.
(Applause) Believe me that it's not easy to face this in front of a sea of people.
Can you imagine then what bullying must be?
Isn't it?
bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they're also known as school harassment.
Well, one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems. However, 5 or 10 years ago, I think a few or none of us had heard this word bullying.
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that's always happened, and, in fact, beyond our age, we have an experience with this kind of situations, that is, because we live it on our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, then, in childhood, we say bullying.
Well, but I think this happens right now, and this for many reasons, first, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least, it wasn't this word bullying.
I wasn't news, the media were not discussed, I didn't try to promise laws to cure it or to criminalize it, of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people and, in fact, it was, but I thought it was something more or less normal.
Besides, an unwanted consequence, an lateral effect, with the unwanted task of school coexistence, but not that serious, some may even think that it contributed to children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school drames were considered much more serious than those fights, with no importance that occurred in recessions in hallways, I mean amounts, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now going out, they tend to do the opposite, which are castings applied by an authority, as a teacher, or a direct, something considered incorrect, something forbidden by regulations, or, on the one hand, these most traditional ones of school humiliations, less serious, sorry, and on the other, they earn new priorities.
Teachers of school humiliation, which are these scenarios that the same students apply among themselves.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change, about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, supporters, bad grades, what operates there is fault.
Culp for having done something wrong, the guilt is an internal, private emotion refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one itself, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be because it's incorrect, but that everyone thinks that it's bad, even me.
No, I feel guilty because I did something bad.
(Laughter) Now, in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion.
embarrassment.
Because it's not exactly the same, it's quite different, embarrassment is a public emotion.
It refers to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something bad, in the case of shame, the problem is not me, but the others, the look of others, that judges me in an incorrect way, sometimes cruel, beyond being guilty or not having done something bad because they are changing our priorities.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of others.
And obviously it was always important, lately, it won a restless weight, dismissing, perhaps, at the moment of playing who each one is, and how much it is.
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, that's not from now, that's been managing for decades, and that's finishing of consuming, now it's crystallizing now, and it seems to me one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief.
During 200 years that previous us, and made it 9, 20, the conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes.
That creates that defined each one in a much deeper and true way that the vanish appearances.
These appearances are not only considered wine, but also false, fruitful.
As something lower, something without importance compared to the entertainment of that -- Well, I think that all this is values and beliefs that remain within us, but that we're abandoning them, that are no longer that vine, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body, that was developed in the last decades, the importance of personal image, of physical aspect, of gymnastics, ofesthetic treatments, all that.
It also matters a lot and it's called "sense" every time, it's what you see and the notion that the most important thing in each one is something you don't see.
But that are not the trips, not that they are inside each one, but that they are not the trips but something immaterial, like the soul or the spirit.
It seemed that we are less believed in that.
And more and more, in what others can see, what we show, what we do.
And according to these transformations, others judge us from what they say, and less from that notion that there is something inside, eternal, half Victoria, an Ancientic anake, that would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this.
We have a series of indices of transformations and one of them would be the car for emotion.
No, the tactics or the self-production techniques that are everywhere and that were recently considered a bad taste.
But let's think of an example: conquest, an obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "me like" This also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and who deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries.
By going through the shows and bullying, but thinking about this broader context doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
When intonestations and bad grades are increasingly less serious, because it seems like guilt.
And he lost a good part of his moralizing effect.
That is, fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a manage, an administration of two sales that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to do what we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and spread our image, but on the other hand, it's always the risk that this full look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for that same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying, when these mocking or disseminations spread on social networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what they used to be privately was to limit the group of acquaintances or...
It has been protected by the walls of the school or house. Suddenly, it exposes to millions of people, everybody knows it, so embarrassment becomes terrible, not much serious, and we don't have to take refugees.
Not inside yourself.
In intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping to an island somehow, that there are fewer and no more, at least not without wifi, which is that system, so it seems that this idea that hell are always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we may poster with respect to ourselves.
Well, if all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do? Also, this is better or worse than before, it's good, bad, how do we solve it?
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues before.
Or it seems that both guilt and shame are mechanisms of social control.
And the fact that guilt is losing most of its work now and that embarrassment is magnifying, that's not good or animal itself.
But it's something we have to take into account, it's a fact.
(Laughter) Because if we keep thinking that things changed in fact, so if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we don't try to solve as if it were the same, we'll probably not go very far.
That's what he wanted to say, thank you.
(Applause) So we talked with my kids at home and I told them that we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
He joined us to choose.
Mamm, I want to live a historical moment.
But for the good ones.
Well, I dedicate myself to researching its education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength, in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us, without wanting.
To explore what happens in a hyperconnected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I've come to think a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think so.
What are we learning some important things?
And I would like to share three of those ideas that I walked around in these days and that I hope there's one of those ideas.
They serve us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first time that, for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency to dare test new ways of teaching.
In innovation and education is something close to what we're talking about.
But until now, it was happening isolately by separate.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and an obligation for emergency.
Those of us who dedicate ourselves to teaching are having to rediscover our classes at a distance.
And in that process?
As if we are encouraging to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
I wanted to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available, but that we had never had before.
urgency in difficult periods of need to use.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms.
Social, media, video games.
Which means that it gives us a result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with the students, with the families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do.
From our box of tools.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings, we have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to have patience, do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
What are we holding our taste?
Take new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know from yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging healthy, as they don't know if well in these days they are even greater than they started to show how to use the compound.
For that, bankers, people of their age.
We're learning in community.
The second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
Just like it appeared once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed.
Do I have it?
A space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn.
When and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially just teenagers.
Learn better when they can organize their own times.
Some study more at night.
Others start with the subjects that interest you the most.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task, or changes on the web, to stop understanding something that doesn't come out to them, or to learn to the new ones who wanted.
This also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working the parade.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
For a thousand youngsters.
organizing their time.
We manage tasks and everything that needs to learn to learn.
And my last reflection.
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as happens?
Nowadays we don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
That is, the value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school.
It disappears stronger than ever is a need like space that guarantees that everyone can learn.
That is, when we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if these days are happening.
We realize it.
The difficult thing is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's never the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
They have a calm place to study and not.
And they have here to ask and not.
The one who has to be all the tasks of care in the house.
And they don't.
The school.
With all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
They are protected.
And focused on that.
And it's called NEF.
As an educator, it worries a lot about how this will follow.
And I also wonder what will remain of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is these days.
Did you see when it gets bad and falls on the naked beach?
Among everything that devastates that tide.
What breaks.
What is taken.
Also on the beach there were some treasures hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
This historical moment isn't for the good ones.
It helps us be own.
Those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not ways to teach.
We replaced the use of time and ways of learning and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
Yes!
Physics are closed, but...
In one of those I'm opening a door to keep building.
Between all of us, when all this happens.
The education we dream.
Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers in calcillators.
From his home.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up 7 toM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand the work of Bubble Drail.
That motorcycles could learn to cyber-attack.
that mythomans and chisms gathered in the spread of conspirantolid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions before, peanphiles, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for smoking and I dreamed.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, we appreciated a button.
Marigón at the free, yes, or Marjuana Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then he always earned most of a day for the other quickly.
(Laughter) Without Northern Sir, nor theoretical deputies, deciding instead of people, I dreamed that the Church was also an online one.
The mothers gave them the curves on YouTube, and of course it was forbidden in my websites on YouTube Kirds.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported to the lawyers and the judges and that, from one day to the other, all those who had ever had rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
Through Google EAT.
And what about in the end?
We got used to buying in the neighborhood's businesses.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they had before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that united who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
No, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
I dreamed that we had to see TED talks from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, they were dots like in the field, and that in the field, I dreamed that at night in the big cities, the stars would come back, they were dots like in the field.
But all of a sudden, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very short communicator, the president said to the people that it was possible to go out to the street, that normal life could be done, leave being the president, occupy their jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed July 9th.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked to the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We suffocated it and killed it.
And that a sintriculing truck shocks against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out of their house.
To the coconut.
To get selfies with the dead avestruz and to steal wine, and there were screams, and soon someone pointed to the other, and the journalists showed up.
To transmit the live massacre and then over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause) It's not something like when you see a picture.
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
(Applause)
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
In other words, to rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw.
What you think is that you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing.
No, and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
We have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds.
I'd eat the last or uncle with a cream that was left in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went to Instagram director.
I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
(Laughter) So I supposed to be a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "It's already, this girl likes art."
Something that later I confirmed with some photos in which she seemed to paint.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
FR: This is a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design.
And among all that, I could also see that it's a healthy person, that touches him and suffers from him, that is very respectful with the environment.
But when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
My mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could know a person like that from social media.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show.
Why not because it's there that means that it's something 100% real?
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To go from a general idea of that person, to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant.
Multicultural and it has a great social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to choose to show us their reality.
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like in which I spoke about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself: What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and I was eating very deserved, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
My behavior in the real world, so to say it, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing.
And, obviously, I ask her dream on social networks, thank you very much.
(Applause)
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
Can you be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what do you see first after that?
You surely have all happened at some point.
For two eyes.
In different parts of the face.
Have you stopped somewhere?
Effectively.
Some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci.
They knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build.
The look of a portrait.
Also, the nazial buildings, the mouth's cracks, the limits of their ears.
The pores and details were fundamental elements to form what we would call.
The look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
Which were the faces parts that the spectators searched?
And developing a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she's looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a team of positioning in a neuroscience laboratory, we put several portraits and registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face?
To extract information, since the rest constitutes the brain.
If we put all the images, all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when we put together.
The portrait, and what is it not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of us.
What we built was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This tremendous rehearsal for the journey of an eye.
It's somehow a stranger.
Some of the projects I take with Mariano Sigman.
an intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Bostudes, languages.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The search of this kindness.
Two questions: the expectation.
Thank you very much.
Well, at the exact moment we were born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me.
What are you so young taking care of old people?
It's my future that I answered it.
I want to live for many years and that's how I go.
What they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
No!
Fear?
Let's live in a society?
Where is the most important thing to be?
Or seem young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They are going to lose value.
What's my word?
It hasn't taken into account.
Miedo.
Let's go to the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities, in labor searchs.
In the jokes, what do we do?
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
Let's see some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the male dive of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-beatable.
That is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
that the elderly are sad or depressed.
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people in my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label.
Class passive: Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact on people's lives because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know?
How difficult it is for a person of 65 more to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found it.
Not a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial purposes.
That includes it.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
It's the majority of public universities in our country.
There's no matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit?
You can teach this to the 69s.
And in the 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
That of the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove, do they place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
The bad media has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults, third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
Gerant.
Ansians.
I still don't find a word.
That identify the conformity to everyone.
The only one that would suggest to avoid?
Is it grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But it's because of affection.
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
The elderly people.
They have a name.
Like all of us.
The stereotypes?
They stimulate them.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050 they will see older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And don't we want to see ourselves?
Neither accept ourselves.
If we collapse, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs.
To design new products and services.
This new longevity.
It opens endless doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment, they are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively for children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people to really understand their new needs?
Its new possibilities.
Deceive.
And you like it.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
To me, one would be clear if they wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Thank you very much.
