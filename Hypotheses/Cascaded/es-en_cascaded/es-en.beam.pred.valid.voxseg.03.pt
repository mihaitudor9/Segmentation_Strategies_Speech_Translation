We are cheerers, we do it by Claudio Rentino with cellos, through instrument trajects of distant rocks and orchestra music, we filled them with the one that avoids the game.
Well, we had a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we go, the main character of our popular music, in order to change the way we play it, so it sounds like Joy Claude, look at the radio!
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires, and the beginning we had to learn to work in detail, it's called by video, each one mouths its part, to the other point above, and so we build the repertoire, we go with this little boy.
Can it be?
So you don't even have what Marseau Pleine did in the workshops.
(Pre-recorded voice) So it hurts me.
And relatives are those who haven't recovered.
That this time they cry.
(Pre-recorded voice) They wake up to see a stance.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic, something that we dedicate to checking the contents of social networks and fighting misinformation, they were already seeing and not worrying about this new era.
During the pandemic of the Olympics, in 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global level, was much lower.
The pandemic, the COVII 19, is the first pandemic that lives with my heart approach, what is infodemia?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
Well, he called it dirt, because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous, we know it, but when it comes to health issues is much more dangerous, what can put in danger is our lives directly.
You don't have an idea, and of course a WhatsApp, or maybe it has been an idea, because regardless of a virus they suffer daily one of these days on Facebook, Instagram, that circulates the viralization of contents to verify.
For four weeks, with my team, we have worked.
Without resting, checking, tricks, truths that circulate over this new disease, false contents.
But you know that we know and we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible, and sometimes they're frustrated.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents related to COVID-19 can fit and are more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this information balance that's on us.
The four categories are simple: The first has to do with contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Compleative theories say that nothing is true, if you see content, a pioneering action of two Chinese scientists stepped from Canada, until an English lab created this virus, don't take it seriously, discard it, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus is contagiated and some media published that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there are no evidence of that.
The third category is related to false treatments and jury, is the most dangerous, it has to be more attentive, the one that has to force us to be more careful.
It's not true that there is already a vaccine that is going to heal, there is no Cuban sugar that managed to generate it. There is no Argentinian who has already discovered the savior vaccine, it's not true that there is already a vaccine, or making vapor, it's a vamp to disappear from our body if we are infected, but at the moment it doesn't have a completely satisfied response.
The fourth category of this information is related to false measures, not the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and obligatory social isolation was expelled, 15 days ago, a little more, a false of credit that said that quarantine started at three in the afternoon of that day, and obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
Not only in Argentina but in the whole world, and that's how it scares us, there are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context, or others with whom maybe you crossed, who will have to be locked in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation in general try to generate panic and anxiety, that's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that comes from one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, like the World Health organization or the South Ministry.
Before finishing, I want to tell you something else we learned, those we dedicate ourselves, checking, checking.
Why?
Why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
We are not comfortable when certainties are missing.
And then we move forward, we move forward to find that certainty without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor, if you receive a content, it's not checking, don't share it, let's replace comparison with doubts, so common.
I don't share my doubts, that doesn't take care of you.
If you receive a content.
And I discovered that fake, that you confirm something, that, you shared a content, disculpate and correct, it's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time, there are changes every day, science works intensely to get the cure and it needs time, while there is a void of evidence and information.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era, with blue content, that if we fill those empty, where the answers to tolerate our ignorance, we'll be much worse than if we tolerate them.
Thank you!
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working in the middle of the pain of other people doesn't make you a bitter person or sad, or the opposite, teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence and be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, not as we wanted them to be, but to see a filagon in an act of reconciliation.
of sorry, of love or transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generates the close presence of death.
When despite having done everything possible, doctors have to work much more on our omnipotentia, to be more humble and not to feel frustrated, or we failed, the result is not what they expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times, it's good to see that there are many people.
That they are suffering, and in much more adverse conditions than ours, and that allows you to put your own perspective on your own problem.
Finally, I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, it's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivate love and compassion help face suffering and be a legacy for family.
Cultivating love and compassion can leave a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Why?
I turned 40 years ago.
(Laughter) After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more own, more personal topics.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why when a man is introduced to himself is enough for him to say?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman like me, I have to decide good evening, I'm a writer and a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
QD: It was already written on many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately that half of humanity is manliness and the other half is feminity, so why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry, at 40.
I am enjoying it a lot, it's such an obvious topic, but at the same time so ignored.
AC: And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations different to a man.
You just have to walk in the street to see that humanity is divided into two groups that walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist on women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
So, did I study biological issues?
Physiological, technological.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
That it doesn't happen, man is everything, in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
That is, man is the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women are the other, they are the other.
Women.
The second sex, the second sex: women are not essential.
And it wasn't defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Exluded like blacks, excluded as planners or Jews, but among them there is a community, they say, "We identify each other."
However, women don't identify themselves easily among them, they don't say us.
In fact, a white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white man than with a black woman.
A bourgean woman will identify themselves more easily with a burgh man than with a projectionary?
Women aren't a community, women don't say us.
Because they live disperse within the group of men.
Why?
Men are quite satisfied to believe and feel the king of creation, they sought theories in religion, biology, even antifeminists, to explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions, of course, as if there were ovaries and a uterus and the rule and hormones would take me any objectivity.
Well, as if they wrote their theories.
AC: They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
And within everything I told you that I studied biology and physiology, I realized something.
That women's behavior isn't dictated by their nature, but by their culture.
Thank you very much.
Nature is that?
Society does not dictate, it's the culture that explains how we are interacting in our society.
Well, in other terms.
QD: You're not born a woman.
It gets to be done.
And I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately recognized as a writer, and at the same time I was recognized as a woman, so I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds, it was a complete, integral, and integral individual.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her to get married, become a slave of her husband.
To have children, devote yourself to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
His feminity resembles to that.
AC: I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
Are we aware of it?
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
(Pre-recorded voice) With free will.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman and every man can and must decide what they want for their sexuality.
AC: On what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what you want to do at work if you want or not to work.
With free choice, free will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together between men and women what I want is to be aware of.
That when it's the second sex.
These questions will have answered and are living them.
So, we will live in a whole, powerful society.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Good afternoon, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the steamer, which is an hypno in search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts come as painted on mountains and colors.
(Video ends) And at the end, she says: "This bread of thoughts so that they give them value to their suffering."
Now, think about it, surely you've been breathing from home, which is something Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years, and we can take it as my own, so many loads up there too, right?
(Laughter) Because I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
Let's go!
Audience: Good morning!
Audience: Oh!
Very good!
Wow!
Wow!
(Laughter) (Music) How strong!
Wow!
A couple of years ago, a group of friends from my school went out to marry for the abortion legalization, I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
He came with me to Congress, I still remember his face when we arrived, looked around him and said to me with a smile and a huge surprise: "Wow, it's full of kids!"
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, the same thing was understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that today is super natural to me: talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
There are villains who oppress, who discriminated the rest in which they say they are more.
And there are teenagers, children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like the one of those books.
And we have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in a terrifying distopy like that of climate change in which we, the youths, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there is one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, anywhere where there is a death bag, there must be aarry, and, of course, also a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it's present in all the bonds, in the culture we consume, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think it's good or bad, even the bonds, for me, have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
(Laughter) Meanwhile, many people prefer to avoid these topics to avoid fighting, their uncomfortable situations.
(Laughter) I guarantee that there are certain things worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone in their political position is not the same as fighting for me because I am in mouth and a kid's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people, if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
Because he can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say: "Well, more and more we start to see marks and political spaces in general, not as dangerous, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and hope there is always, but there is always a place for teenagers, it's full of children, thank you very much.
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a cup like this to take water home?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted?
But was this color?
But the world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life, and without it we wouldn't exist, in fact, human beings, we, every day, contaminate our waters, our rivers, the main lakes, through the farming of our big companies' farming, and even our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not only about the appearance of diseases around the world, but also the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world, this means that if we selected 10 people randomly from anywhere on Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is somehow paradoxical, since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we rise a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries, almost 20 million people, that is, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
Well, these are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth is in front of this situation.
And we do the bags and gather together again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, from Mexico to Peru, founded this in Guatemala of the project.
(Laughter) Let's make the luck that we did have, for being born as a self-caravan, so that we call the Blanca wound and, above all, we carry out some tremendous willing to return to it.
During the way we were going to find them with rural communities and rural camps that rarely have water at home.
All of them I could go rounds or marantials to be able to see, but always, with a common problem: water and this pinea.
It's polluted.
(Laughter) All these communities usually have three ways to purify spending, money resources to buy these subsidies or time resources to go and look for the lenses and then we can do, to help increase this problem.
"Yes."
Through the basis that we were experts in the matter, we put them humans to the work, and after many weeks of research we found a system.
Understanding by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
And I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works almost like a color.
(Laughter) Stop spending only clean water, retaining in 99% of all these damaging substances about the health of love, contaminated water passes by the end.
It's health.
Thank you very much.
It's a velar system that is a completely revolutionary system and we consider that it's only the weight of the water to make the team work.
Can you imagine the impact of these filters in the lives of all these people?
(Laughter) Well, and now?
We want to tell you a story: Leocruz is a 21-year-old boy.
It belongs to October 15th colony in Trinity, in Guatemala, Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, so much he, as all his populate, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the handbook of which was supported, was very polluted by ethical stages around us, in our parade.
And Leo signed up in an English course.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) You can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride it was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
To fulfill, among other things, your dreams.
In total, we delivered 78 community filters, destined to schools, Mexico or Atemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatel Vancroy came up with an idea, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
Now, we've never been alone, before leaving, they brought their goal through a crowdfunding campaign, which was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
And nine months later.
But fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together we have created a social movement that has made from the trip of these four friends an unstoppable caravan against the world's crisis.
But there's still a lot, there's still a lot to do, millions of people still have no drinking water and need our help.
And besides, the world's crisis can be one of the risks of the biggest risks in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
(Laughter) We call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident, we have created many needs that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago, where we've seen how large embotellers were taking advantage of the local suppliers that supported communities, so they were taking them completely the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those land, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil oil?
so that we can all fill the deposit of our vehicles.
They are making the communities have to get there, what they are doing is to pollutate, to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or or the Amazon rivers, we've been there, and it's amazing, and in the future, this will probably disappear to their culture.
But it's really incredible and living it hasn't left us something that has opened.
It's really something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
It's a reality that is not just one.
It's a reality that, on November 12, 2016, is directly affecting all of us and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far away in California.
That a technological development world is powering people for consuming too much water, they are cutting their minister.
VB: For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffer from drought, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the houses of water in the future.
But if we really want to make a change, if we really want to impact on this planet.
This small NGO that is trying to build powers in Guatemala to distreal, what we have to do is to support local projects, in our city, that are trying to reduce water consumption, in our cities, about the problems and necessities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the life that these big companies say, that, of course, they are not doing things right now.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck that we have to reach our homes.
Opening water shifts and always water goes out, or it's not like that.
JP: Let's stop worrying this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
And we have to act, we have to raise awareness and act and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
And so we won't be able to achieve the change we want to see in the world.
(Laughter) Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
Who has played, how beautiful it is for here?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making an commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources, and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency that generates our heart, our emotion.
So I'm going to ask a quick question, especially all the front lines in front to put ourselves in context, how society is today, raise your hand and tell me, three or four answers, I compress myself with you, and when we see the frequency that gets into our heart, it's a thousand times higher than the thought, fast, right?
An accident from Cadent, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you saw the answers that you just gave, and then to another question, is it OK?
(Laughter) Those of you who cry happy, raise your hand.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy, that we are, where is society?
When we talk about society that we refer to, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy, and if they've always spoken about us, more or less questions, they would have told us: "In that line, one, the answers that sometimes take, we go to schools, we take the day diary, to the children, and we tell them, look for good news, how many good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby, not good, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
When they ask me how you're perfectly fine, it's plate that 7th of July 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something is wrong, we complain about everything. What is the heat 3 of black 3 in the afternoon? What happened to you?
Sometimes they heard someone who says: "This cannot be this has to change, this is a disaster, what this has to change, my wife of work we are complaining all the time, so we transform ourselves into claims, we have a second national sport that has to do with claim. This cannot be that climbed the soy, do you know why the soy was up?
(Laughter) You understand that the dollar is going down there, under and you know, we leave everything, we opens the economy, the politics of... And there's something more worrying today, we've started to have our mind oriented to the crisis, we complain, we claim, and we're immersive in the opinion, what makes it fall in a sort of vital distancing.
WWat, you've seen that we leave our house with a cell phone charged 100 percent, and besides, we have a charger for the doubts that it's not too expensive, but with our energy we start the day with a vital stancing, with a kind of fatigue.
In addition, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the ring, that wonderful day, and the ring says to me, "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, especially in our generation, that we have left, in front of society in moral crisis, that even in the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine, faced, breathed, but besides, we are making our children believe, and we don't make them believe this, how is this quote that we are the architects?
We need to want, we are in Argentina, listen to this, and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
We don't just leave this society as it is, but we also make ourselves believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher, right now.
For a long time, I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that talent was important, I had to have talent, I had to have experience, and every time I became more engaged in this, I saw that all of them add, but the multiplying attitude, that is a zero type, that all these things add up, but the multiplying attitude.
So I started to say, well, as to get out of this position and the first thing I saw is that here in this square meter, I saw in a respectful world, that's why it was really bad, I started to say that I was going to leave the victim's attitude of all the time being justified, criticizing, crying, and at the time, and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing, if we're always waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but also, we are what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started educating, I thought there's a lot of way to educate, for me alone, with the example, every time we do something, someone is watching us, starting from our square meter, to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
And if you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare, if you're with a group of failures, that's an unhappy group, if you start with a square meter to contagiate solidarity, optimism, you start emitting that energy, because what energy it produces your square meter is the important, what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo on his side, he would give it, it doesn't matter what to be advertising, and I tell the girl: "Pelices Pascuas" and she says to me, "There were 300 people, and I the first one that made me happy is Pascua, he doesn't tell me, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain, what do you fit?
In respect, I respect, committing myself, gratefully committed, my father left me huge heritage, always told me: "Plata and fear I've never had, with bad humour, all the decisions, all small differences, the path you get, this is what you take on one side to the other, you'll listen to that, or I don't see everything I have, or I see everything that I lack."
We work, no, let's be safer each time, and I'm going to share two life experiences with this Dalbis Foundation, Borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we were doing, last week we gathered veterans from war of Argentinians and British, a british board came, a burk, and gathered with Argentine veterans and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won, and they know who to close the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
A place where I act was of lack, I thought there were a lot of things missing, and I understood that all the time I was worried about what I lacked, and one morning I see a Palestine woman being the city of Belén, and she huggs with other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration, so I say, what are they celebrating?
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, with drinking water at home every week.
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water and celebrate it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
I ask: "Do you know what the genius is in lamparadine, all through the translator, they told me, I have no idea?"
So I'm going to explain to you what that genius is in the lamparadine.
And I tell her: "I bring you a desire, what do you ask me? Chevista looks at me all excited and says to me.
"Oh, give me my hot water bathroom."
As its great desire, and at that moment I was connected with what I was missing all the time, I realized that, since I was born, I had to think if I would have water to drink, if I would be able to give a bathroom, I would have to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude, I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
The first step will have three steps and the exercise: I ask you to close your eyes to all, to close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never realize and we thank health, like the possibilities we have, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to bathe, have water, like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do, that at this moment you feel, welcome or selected, or chosen by everything you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now, that express this gratitude.
Stop standing up, claping it stronger, that can shout at doing what they want, the gratitude they feel for the protagonists we don't realize -- (Applause) Well up, they can shout, they can shout, they can do what we receive, very well there, for what we have, for what we have, for the love of our loved ones, for the love of our loved ones.
(Applause) Barba, Barba, loist... Yes!
(Applause) And what did I quit?
(Applause) See for a moment.
The longest way to go?
There are four pads, when we manage to move from our heads, we connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we realize, everything we have and not everything we need, but a decision.
We managed to turn off the turbo for a moment, and that every day of your life, when you are going to give a shower.
Do you remember that there is a place in a world of a 10-year-old boy in the genius of the gradual lamp?
So he asks him what you will start doing.
Audience: Yes!
And from there you realize that we can choose the path where we're going to travel if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Why?
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others, and you don't need to be an instrumentist or be a musician to avoid music. Do you know why? Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin, in pulse, in rhythms, salt, sal, sal, salt, salt, in the moon, one of life ...
But also music dressed in pauses, in silence, and it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive: "Music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy, for clothes!
Until we grow up and bring music with us, and it also creates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools to be able to go together and grow in community, so that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Welcome.
To the cell, yes!
Believe me that it's not easy to face this in front of a couple of people, imagine then what must be suffering bullying, bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as school harassment.
Well, but I think this is happening now is called bullying, so there are simultaneous and complementary humiliations of school humiliations, but not that serious, some may even think that they are the punishments applied by an authority, like a teacher, or a director, or at least it wasn't this word, but it's not exactly the same, now it's called bullying, or because it's also said "what good" or "mulher" or "mulher" or "mulher" or "l" or "fem" or "fem" or "fem" or "fem" or "fem" or "fem" or "fem" or "mell" or "fem" or "fem" or "mell"
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
A school humiliation moves, which are these castings that the same students apply among themselves for the most diverse reasons, but almost always for something related to physical and personality of the victim.
Well, if this is happening, the question is why, because this transformation in our values, and I think it's a big historical change, a huge historical change in which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, supporters, bad grades, what operates there is fault.
I'm sorry for having done something bad, even me, I feel guilty because I've done something bad: fault is an internal, private emotion refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each of us himself, for having done something that not only regulations, say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect, but that everyone think that this is wrong.
Now, in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion: shame.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different, embarrassment is a public emotion, it doesn't refer to a private drama of each one by himself, for having done something bad, something bad.
So, in the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others, the others.
The look of others, that judges me in an incorrect way, unfair, sometimes cruel, beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that exercise my cruel look.
Because it seems to me that the alien look, the look of the other, which obviously was always important.
Lately, they won a demeasurable weight, perhaps, at the moment of judging who each one is, and how much it is.
And this hasn't always been like that, and of course, it's very complicated because it requires a management, an administration that the most important thing about these transformations, that is, fault, it's not, that's why I say it's a great historical change, but let's think, as an example, the conquest, the absence, the absence, the absence, the absence, but it seems that each of us, in this most important context, not only consider something so serious, but something so serious, but something so serious, and what has to do, what has to do, what has to do, what has to do, and what is important, what is the most important, and what is the most important, and what is the rest, and what is the most important, what is, what is, and what is the most important, what is, and what is, what is, what is, and what is the most important, what is, and what is, what is, what is, and what is, what is, what is the most important, what is, what is, and what is, what is, what is, what is
But on the other hand, there's always the risk that this alien look, we don't have where to take refuge, not inside oneself, nor intimacy, nor even dreaming of escaping to a certain island, that increasingly exist, or that's no longer, at least "wi-fi," that's the theme, and so what we used to be privately, to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the walls of the school or the house, of the house, of a sudden, profiles, always visible, thousands of screens.
That's not good, an animal in itself, but it's something we have to keep in mind, that is a fact, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before, and that embarrassment is magnifying, it's losing a good part of its future, now, and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we'll probably not go far away, in that case what he wanted to tell, or a data.
I received a few days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we were not going to forget about these days, and some of them told me, "Mom, I want to live a historical moment, but of the good thing."
But a doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
Today I'm thinking a lot about this: Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think that yes, that we are learning some important things, nowadays and that hopefully, one of those are useful to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency to encourage us to find new ways of teaching.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help give a huge step of innovation and education is something that is being talked closed, but that, until now, were happening isolately by separate.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes backwards, and in this process we are encouraging us to test new ways to do things, and for that we realized that there was no, but that we had never had before, the emergency in difficult periods of use.
You see tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families, which are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this, I think, is that once we tried them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box, and little by little, and in the middle of the frustration they bring, we'll take the taste, to test new ways to teach and learn.
And this isn't only happening in the formal system, even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as it's not good, nowadays they are remarkable that they started to show how the compound to the workshop of tissue, today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching the line, what they know, from yoga lessons, we're learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn, just like once and again.
(Laughter) And suddenly today, from one day to another, that's happening.
In these days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with teenagers, some study more at night, learn better when they manage to organize their own times, others start by the subjects that are more interested, others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to finish to understand something that doesn't happen to them, or to learn something new, that they wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on, from very young age, that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them that for all boys and girls to take advantage of those moments of autonomy of the children we need to learn.
And my last reflection is rather a question: What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physics school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
When boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks, I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
The one here to ask and the one who doesn't, the one here to ask and the one who doesn't, the one who has to do all the care work at home, is not just the one who has a computer and the one who doesn't, the one who has the Internet and the one who doesn't.
The school, with all its difficulties, at least during only one leave, put those inequalities in parentsis and helps all boys and girls to be protected and with the opposite focus.
(Pre-recorded voice) And in full mother.
Well, as an educator I really care about how this will follow, and I also ask myself what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine, my sensations these days is that.
When they get bad marks and they're on the naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes, also on the beach, seem to be some treasures hidden.
I hope that even though, as my son said, this historical moment isn't for any good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding, the desire to explore in community is not a way to teach, to replicate the use of time and learning, and also to realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
Today, physical works are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens, the education we dream of.
A: Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the Corentena lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this, that the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the remote control route, driven by trucks in calcillles, that the benches improved in their X-rays to the cheese and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because Chorese myths learned to be cyberattack, to study sleeping environments, that mythmans and Chinese, that those who used to buy poths, pangphiles, naïve people, shared those lies with their friends.
That all the merchants worked for Rivery Soñé, and that in the end we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business, I dreamed that when we saw a neighbour, we would help them from far away with the chest, and that the sunny people searched quickly, without dinner, nurses, or catalogical deputies, they decided to learn to play a monkamo, but in fact, and that seemed very good.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered, addicted it, I dreamed that at night in the big cities the stars would meet again, they were dots like in the field, they would proliferate all of a sudden waving hair and so on the way out, I woke up, and that they fell off the truck, and we killed it, or that they made addicts to something else, and that they no longer lasted 18 minutes later.
And I felt better.
It's not so that when you see a photo, sometimes there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly on the picture, or people who are a little nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think the photogeneration is there, I embraced that challenge to do with detachment, to indicate the etymology of the gesture, and we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
Yes!
And just like I did, I felt challenged and I decided to try it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or unite with a cremma that remained in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted, I put the cranometer and went straight to Instagram, I wrote a letter by chance, and I entered the first profile that appeared, I pulled up to the kar, I started to see everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the old women in number 18: A lot of people back, family, friend, Gachippachi, singing the happy birthday.
Well, so I seemed like a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "That's it, until a girl likes art." Something that later I could confirm with some photos in which she seemed painting.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
So, that's a trans girl who inherited the school last year and who is now studying graphic design, and among all that I also could see that it's a healthy person, who needs to rent him and to cope with him, so he is very respectful with the environment.
(Laughter) But when these ten things had happened 28 seconds, my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could meet someone like that from social networks, it's true that in social media everyone chooses what they want to show.
And not because it's there that means that I leave 100% real.
(Laughter) But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken months to pass from a general idea of that person to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first meet the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person, understanding this way what I see in my first impression.
My generation is tolerant, multicultural, and it has a lot of social and environmental concern. This increases a lot more on social networks. An example is like the girl I found on Instagram, I didn't judge her to be trans, on the contrary, to find myself with what I see on the other person helped me to question myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making this kind of challenge with my mother, I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like when I talked about taking care of the environment, and there I started to ask myself what I am saying to take care of the planet, if I really want to take care of it, and if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and my comedy very deserved, invited with a cream, we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds move to our day-to-day meetings.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, that's why it changed completely, when I met a person I don't know, I don't search for a label to enchance it, I try to know it more in that first instance, I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
So, I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask your user in social networks, thank you very much.
And I would like you to pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
And what parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You probably have all experienced at some point, in two eyes, in different parts of your face, you've had somewhere.
Effectively, some artists like Alberto Jacometi, or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that pores and details were fundamental elements to create what we would call the look of a portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew which parts of the face were that the spectators were trying to develop a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the constitution of a look, and at the same time they're looking for the other, which is the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be if we could see how a spectator came to, in a calculation team in a neuroscience laboratory, put several portraits in front of many people, and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the meeting of who already looked at the portrait, the portrait, and which not, what we obtained is how we build the image in time, to extract information, since the rest of the brain is composed, how our eyes select certain specific parts of that face, the portrait, which we speak just and the look of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others, we grow it, that's what I am showing laws and that I want to share with you.
This brief prejudice I tested for the journey of an eye is the search for childhood, customs, languages, in which we travel with some maps of art and various leaves of the field of science, but that, fundamentally, we like to think in a way as a journey, questions, expectation, thank you very much.
SV: At the exact moment we were born.
We start to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life, the most natural process of human beings.
(Video ends) However.
It's the most resistant.
Do we invest so many resources in living more and more years?
And even so.
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
"Nobody wants to be old."
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me, "What are you so young?"
It's my future, I answered, "I want to live for many years, and I go there, what they didn't say that moment, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this issue."
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
DB: No!
Meet to live in a society where the most important thing is.
To be or to look young.
I keep my knowledge and my experience losing value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination for age is the most widespread in the world, and the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides, stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted, can we see them?
In publicities, in labor searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them, or we let them happen.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that the elderly are sick or depend on others, when the data of the varomer of social debt tells us that 70 percent of the elderly people, today in Argentina, are self-based, that is to say, that they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief that the elderly are sad or depressed.
When 80 percent say being happy, and that's much more than what people in my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label.
It's passive.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
They are doing sports, taking part in volunteers, taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact on people's lives because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
And if I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is proved that the projects involving elderly people have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults, not elderly.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
It's in general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time it was about older people, they used the same photo.
That of the older person in a park, giving them food to their dove.
(Laughter) Do you see it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images, words are missing.
older adults, third age.
Levely, elderly are the suits.
DB: Great!
It's old.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everyone.
(Pre-recorded voice) The only thing I suggest is to avoid a grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection they justify some.
But it's because of affection.
I could say "my friend" because she's a woman in reproductive age and doesn't correspond.
The elderly have a name like everything.
And stereotypes?
And they hurt.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old, in 2050 they will see older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
(Video ends) If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, create employment, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example, in this country.
One out of three elderly people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively for children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Well, many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why, my proposal is to listen and learn from older people to really understand what their new needs are, their new possibilities, desires and desires are.
A while ago, when I interviewed an older person, one was clear to me if they wanted to be activities with people of their age or with younger people, and I asked them, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Why?
