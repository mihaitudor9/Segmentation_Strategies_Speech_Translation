(Applause)
I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
So I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
We need to learn to feel.
Think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water, with that feeling of ungravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, turtles, molamous fish.
Sometimes, from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Do you have gangs?
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
I know what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he speaks to fish, right?
It's the same thing my students think at university, every time I tell you about it, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
(Laughter) Yes!
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
The work of 24 hours during a week to draw that artwork we're going to see, or on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that sentence we see.
And it proves that nature has awareness.
And that I'm not crazy.
And if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
And in fact, I bring you more scientific proves.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems were analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
(Applause)
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
Do you remember the Cliver's law?
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
The planet we live in is made of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I ask myself: Is it a simple coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of human beings. That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here they give you a summary.
And I remember with scientific consensus, with the explosion of Big Bang, the universe came up 13.700 million years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.5 billion years ago.
During the first half of this period, the forms of going to Earth primogenites stayed in very simple levels.
With the appearance of free oxygen and the atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated, the newspapers, with the cosmic exclusion of the pregnant.
Thanks to the possible remains found until the date, it's known that the autropitects have about 4 million years and I moved a little later, the first or less of the mammals, where Bergirio, the period, biological variety has increased high speed, like, for example, the tricophic chain, that have developed survival strategies.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed.
It's like something unsustainable.
What is it that does between species?
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species?
A single species, another unitian?
It is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of species.
And that is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
So, from the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
Although it seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees integrated.
And if that was not enough, future generations are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we leave in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020, we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Do I follow the world's forum of nature?
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the mutaches in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, because it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of cronic shortage of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignity.
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
Let me give you an example: imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Moving forward, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not the competition, but the symbolic union of having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the technical body behind them.
Our body is a pluricellular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradoxically, nature is the best immune model and perfecting to achieve sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time.
It has suffered catastrophs of glaciation, meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
But human beings continue to create a linear thinking ideology.
Doctrina is political, like drugs who failed communism, who failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has failed as well.
A study from Oxford last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet -
It has more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick patologically and that if it's charged, because nature advances to obtain economic benefit, we've sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
Life, my great imitation, life imitation.
But this is not new, it's already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
And it's something inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you.
Make a game.
I have an imagination, what happens to this turtle?
How could engineers, architects, economists be inspired?
Well, they thought of making a plane.
What would happen to the peak of the birds Martín Bolador?
The Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
With this blue turtle.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature ...
It will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP.
What does PIB mean, many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build?
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in.
It's not a gift of our parents, but a president of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
A future to dialogue with their children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me, "Daddy."
At least you tried it, you fought.
And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) What I have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity, and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's horrible things, which we spoke about doing everything missing before.
But it has many with complicated proposals, politically.
Economically, huh?
We feel bad, socially with good, we engage with our friends.
It's asleep, there's nothing to do with this, and not about why thinking that it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of and we're not losing it if we don't take advantage of it and that it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, a horrible moment.
Do I say that?
Life is not about something else, that goes through horrible moments and learning from them, we learn the pain of the disease.
We see them from war, we see them from death, if we cry and we will continue doing it.
So.
We're going to do that now.
And what I didn't have, I just have to enter.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, so cinema is right to the world.
These are the newspapers that have already led me in the 80s to return to their passion from childhood to kindergarten, three men from a film until, in fact, after their diagnosis...
They are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the important spaces of their career.
But what he decides a girl is that he will buy a land instead of a horrible hospital.
And I was going to take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
Like the person: "Are you writing?"
For him, taking care of a garden wasn't meant to be time.
It wasn't, well.
The time went by.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking towards bread or whatever.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing is, what do we do if we look at it plate?"
They are forbidden.
And I thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From Figengers, basically.
And that later I took particularly the feminist mark.
To talk about reproductive work, not even productive work, which is the one that put new things in the world, we can say, always my father or a slap, it doesn't matter.
And it's a reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that: cleaning, cooking, taking care, right?
Do you see?
So he cooks the workers so that the next day he would put the factory, his own productive work.
And feminists have spent a long time now.
Suming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
Now, why the edge of zero in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
And even more, why don't we do as insuberry and think that this difference is contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more inflictive difference given by one side.
Of course, gender, for the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are traditional productive, performed by the aurorae.
And reproductive ones.
(Laughter) It brings it if you don't interview me because the best are important.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject of the original, this can be monolars in the world in which the subject that sets.
No, take care of?
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it doesn't make you an artist.
They don't make you adversary, they don't make you an important person, right?
These are well-known values, we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We're living without wrists and writers.
In a lot of things, I was moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food.
And without care.
And without nurses.
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
Is it eating?
Be careful.
What clean?
And without that the world of magic?
So?
Is it your tasks?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
Not just a mechanical thing that we need to go up, that I hope there would not exist, that I hope you could do this, clean it almost, cook it, it's not just seeing food.
It can't, we can think like that, we have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans is that...
I also start living them differently.
Can we live them?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title wasn't modern nature, modernity, not like...
Human beings separated from the natural world that...
Just to do what is interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
The care relationship with our bodies, we think there's someone to take care of the body.
No, here the stage has to...
Coffinada.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
She looked at me.
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
I think...
Is this not an opportunity?
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
No, we all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now!
Is there another world that needs more soap operas?
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
Instead of being obsessed with being productive these days.
And knowing all the holes and all that, why not think?
to connect with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in a different way from that.
That's why, when I was invited to do this, I almost said no, because I thought I didn't want to have an intention of an original idea, the world didn't have decided another novel and the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what was already there.
I had my books and that might help other people, right?
More than writing it down.
What else to do?
Fourth.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
No more bread.
You don't have puerters.
It's enough every 15 days.
Hmm ...
An end of a half.
These foods don't get fat.
What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them.
That's why I want to name you today.
Three key aspects.
To have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
Audience: Yes.
Once a teacher told me, "Take awareness is high to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject.
I'm talking about our subconscious.
Our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take awareness is high to our desires...
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one who doesn't like the most.
And after that?
Are we aware of what we are feeding with, what are we eating?
And in which amount?
A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, it's not hungry.
That blood of all, it's hungry, it's the warmer.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
He's always forbid it.
It has been the most tempting, right?
The one who diets, restricts, fast foods, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
"Be, dream, hug, a burrow with twice?"
Great!
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
That is, pizza.
Thank you very much.
I'm talking about a hole.
Impossible, right?
So, the second aspect is practice: to eat.
Like every process in life, you learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
That my include represents itself.
That is, we must learn to eat in this station.
What does this mean?
To eat the food that was costed at that time.
This is going to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and put a god in our health.
A: Because foods surrounded by their own times.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
necessary for our body.
Or it's normal to see fruit all year long, or it's normal to see tomatoes.
In winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee a quality consumption.
And a variety.
Where we are not going to fall in the monotony of eating always the same.
The last aspect?
That for me it's not less, but it's one of the most important.
In the moderation.
To those who don't break.
Because they are not hungry, because they don't have time, because many times they go to use them.
And I have a question.
They also give them Ausias.
Repeting the mattress dish with cold?
To think, right?
Audience: Yes.
So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
That hunger is not variable.
Yes, they restring food, if they eat.
Well, what wasn't consumed in the day is going to consume in the afternoon or night and double portion.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volume.
And increasingly with more strength.
So, if we don't stop.
Each three.
Four hours.
To take a swing.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace way.
In the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash all the food that we have around us.
Audience: Yes.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unfold the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating.
The more flaws I'll be, the more weight I'll lose.
And no.
The most experienced body becomes in reserve.
Sguarding.
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, I mean this, to all we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave for favor of ignorance.
Food can hurt you or can cure you.
It depends on us, about taking awareness, what are we feeding and in what amount?
I'll go back.
It's the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation.
Would one should exist?
It starts with moderation.
This food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure.
I propose you to eat rich.
To eat everything you like.
To eat various, but always take care of the portion.
Nothing, there is the phrase of "Sayuna como rey."
Along as a prince and dinner as a begging.
I think many people know it.
Audience: Yes.
health doesn't have excuses, "Oh, I can't, there I don't have one, there."
I was hungry or worse.
Sometimes she died of hunger.
We have four opportunities every day.
To choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthily.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A while ago I was obsessed with telling stories of female scientists: "I love it, the first one that happened obvious Marie Curie."
They didn't give a Nobel Prize, they were given two, so they deserved their pedestal, but there are many others who didn't get a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things, I recently found out the story of Ogenia to be a dote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
He made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one who brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s, thanks to her, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less since 2011 I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
And that's what I want to do.
How I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that that made me find out of them very recently, very much anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were.
(Applause) But, above all, to not lose those who are, thank you very much.
(Music) (Applause)
We lost a long time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They are bouncing from the century to the century for a long time.
Since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography a very clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond to one letter, each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French.
He always had a strong resistance to write too different than how we pronounce.
But it's not there, because when in the 18th century we decided how we would uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological.
The one who says that we have to write according to words was written in its original language, in Latin, in Greek, and that's how we stay with Hesmudas, whom we write, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with velargas and decorations that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the forecastation of the Spanish.
That's how we stay with ges, which are sometimes aspers as people, and sometimes they rise their aves as a cat, so we stay with ces, feces and zets.
Other letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
All of us invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that plastic brain time, childly, indicated.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full of exceptions.
We were transmitted in many forms with implications and explained the idea that in ortography something was key to our training.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that complied ortography?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
Antography is used to uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example.
In ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved.
In puntuation, yes.
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing, with ortography, no.
With ortography or is it good or bad?
Does it just or doesn't add to the current norms?
But then, wouldn't it make sense to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
Why do we dedicate all that time to teaching ortography?
We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that everyone writes whatever they want.
Longue is a common tool, and therefore I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest possible.
Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling below.
When ortography is simplified, the quality of language does not feel at all.
I work every day with literature to say it of gold, frightening, servant, gongora, what do I see?
The time they write: "With no House," sometimes they write "rescribing with a scholarship."
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention still at the time.
But it's not a quality.
But let me go back to the teachers because they're key characters in this story. I mentioned that insistence a bit irreflexive with the teachers who hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the blame of raw, the educated of the ignorant, regardless of the content.
From what you're writing, you can be able or stop achieving a job by a H, who put or stopped putting on.
You can become an object of public mockery for once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout history of our language, there were always teachers or individuals linked to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reforms, sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the highest ortographic reform that had indeed occurred in Spanish language, which was the one in Chile.
It's half-time.
In the 19th century.
Because then, not taking the bet of those teachers and start moving forward in our orthography, I'm here, in the intimacy of us the 10,000, I'd like to put some modifications on the table that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Audience: Yes!
There, where we write an H, we choose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one can argue, we want not with one, we eliminate the other: "Ge, son, let's divide his functions, that from Swiss sound, let's eliminate HEMUDA.
Gato, magician, thread, and the towelry turns the sound "open."
Jalabe, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that phonetic criteria should be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, prediction differences should be attended, now I said before, that Iceta in some places correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit tragic: they are not so much, the real Spanish Academy, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified.
That language is linked to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool for everyday use and that sometimes the attachment to history, traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
For today's use.
This explains, in fact, that our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically close, were modifying ourselves historically, for example.
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater, to theater, we were of quantity, we were of symbol, of symbol.
And little by little, now, some seeds start to be removed in the dictionary of the Real Academia.
Arpa.
Armony can write with H or H.
And we're all fine.
Does it sound like me anyway?
This is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
Audience: Yes!
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
That are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is an academic, in other places a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
A lot of time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
(Laughter) This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the level of words, it's less true.
For the gramatic level, and almost I would say it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to down, it was always the institutions that fixed the norms.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment, until now, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use?
But at our time, the time of social networks.
That's suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now, never so many wrote in the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale wild ortographic shapes.
Even people with impecable ortography, hyper-educated, when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
That's it.
There are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention, because they're probably telling us that once they assign to writing, a new place, they're asking for that writing, new criteria.
I think we would do bad to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, no, I think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
Audience: Yes.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic.
With simplified orthography we will recover the etymology at the same place where we are now, the etymological dictatorships.
A second served objection of those who say if we simplify ortography, we are going to stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true.
But it's not a problem: our language has homony, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit from the bank where we depositate.
In the vast majority of situations, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one who says: "I don't want to change."
I get hurt like this, I got used to this way when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "The eyes hurt me."
(Laughter)
(Laughter) This objection, in part, is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules?
Those who don't want, let us write how we are used to it.
And it is expected that time feels the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits.
The consensus is in favor, the level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us.
I'm convinced that if we do that in the modest field, but important of language, we'll be leaving the next generations a future.
Better ... (Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Thanks before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around the delirium.
And say to myself, don't hang your eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense, he had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my training as a photographic film.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
The whole universe inside my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy.
It became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And there's another one.
It's the brother of another and that's how I could teach you infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than an end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life.
And now I'm going to tell you a project.
For me, this teaches me.
That our pureest material essence.
We are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror there is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is spatial.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
Shouldn't we create a "imbap" of education?
Imagine a public agency that designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
So, an agency with pedagogies.
Digners, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should come to the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step is to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, education changes won't benefit the most advanced. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) I'm a scientist and I've been doing experiments for years to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From great disasters.
extraterrestrial inventions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home, we stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners, human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Who is an unconscious logic?
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than the answer.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy it.
It's also very unique to human beings trying to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology, called "the optimist blind."
The same here makes many of us handle or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages.
thinking that in reality nothing will happen to us.
It made the major politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen to us now?
Unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmas.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, Japan has been proposed that everyone uses more chairs.
The first thing makes people sick and don't realize this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you use more stairs we get sick.
So this would be a kind of accusatoryuse to know who's sick and who's not because of whether they wear or not cards.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the estimation and this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that we really need motivation to do it.
We've discovered this now for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change them.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the premature need.
And the world keeps moving.
But also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to limit individual liberties.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority.
And if on this idea, how we can change our principles and how we can adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment.
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also to govern ourselves and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we were, where we moved them.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, perhaps our viral charge.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this council can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
The one in your child and not at home, the one who is not at risk can go out.
And we keep on this mental experiment imagining that with this we really increase the effect of the epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but there are fewer people die and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk or bad use of them.
It's still true.
There's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
That you could choose if you feel good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
A triple, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom.
That are fundamental values, pillars in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe.
To see our data is a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When I spent all this.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free?
And care.
Are they going to fly less avions in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we also realize that we can also take part of our data as a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever.
What do we want it to be the comprervative sex of the coronavid?
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagone, in Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
(Sigh)
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples," are part of the sea's wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment ...
I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea's dollar broke, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
But?
I'm interested in fossils, my fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me and taking me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
It's a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000 for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity ...
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
It's a quantity of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well, life has led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I have traveled some and studied fossils from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa.
Studying fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagonia?
And when we say "patagonia."
We naturally think of these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists ...
Patagonia is this: it's a wonderful and full of fossils.
What are left to be discovered?
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world.
to look for dinosaurs.
And most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the creptic period.
This is already about 70 million years ago.
(Laughter) We know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The most common carnivores belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While for that time, in the northern hemisphere there were other families of carnivores, like, for example, hot shotans.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the South hemisphere of the northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, what we call the legal period about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her key meat, especially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time.
They completely denied the planet.
For the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivorous carnivores of omnivorous worldwide.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagone Law.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon?
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
You see, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the path where it hurt us.
I approached, stood next to me, shooled, I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and at the same time I knew it was, after studying years of bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the trash part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really?
I couldn't believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
After warning the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given from winter.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
And to see if there was something else, it was only the skate we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day of the stadium.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
In the dinosaurs' findings, it's a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way its skeleton.
And that's where the excavation really begins: to throw it away, layer, those sediments that were burning.
A dinosaur is a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time going back to the surface.
An animal?
I was living in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Llenemal had to have died, it had to be covered by sedentary layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sedentary layers, and that food was transformed into sedentary rocks.
In that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Then, all that buried rocket had to rise up to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a raise.
From all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
In the same summer we were walking away from those hills, the layers that contained this dinosaur.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience.
They are removing grain to the grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizáurus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizures, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
From what we thought: long before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate being divided by a big ocean, at the time of panaga, when all continents were united in a big supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transport to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We went to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those rock blogs.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very special, also because of something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, wouldn't take more than 50 feelings from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this meth of a dinosaur didn't look like any other way.
That we against what we knew about the northern hemisphere, studying its remains, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, rocks in the same ancient times.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean still hasn't been formed yet to these two continents today.
No, but once again we had a case.
That is to say, of restricted animals, the only ones of the South hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work with other animals who lived in this time in fossil plants that have been found in this region.
And also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us.
Of the environments of this time.
Ridering the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment in Pangea, where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic, that was possibly present the existence of a big is true.
In the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy who had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these faines, it wasn't a full of water.
That's what I want to say.
And when do we really think about dinosaurs?
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are going to tell us that they are really fantastic, fansifascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is, the history of life.
They have been diversified and conquered those of all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing -
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in rocks, that are formulated for millions of years in our planet, trapped each time.
The animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
And life occupies a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
There were millions of pages still to read this book, and if we really want to know our planet, its poems, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays.
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past...
It's key to understand the present.
Yes!
It's also key.
(Applause) To project a future ... (Music)
(Applause)
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid ...
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dreamed of healing.
And contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
Well, time...
It gives us a real bathroom.
You lost the subway and you don't have the magic bag of puppets.
They saw empires invading small villages.
And you don't have the choice of standards to defend them.
But something like a child's vocation...
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation that we have to live.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are not my own ideas, or I learned them from others.
And this is it.
The main part of all ideas, something like the zero idea of this I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Pooling our mind with...
Ideas powerful.
and practicing.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
You turn around the hall parks, fixed bikes.
They go to the bar, ask for a coffee with milk, with three months from some of them and it will be common.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
They develop the referee.
We need to think and give time to think.
Intelligence is not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I seen the saying?
Who only has a bottle?
I see all the problems as a slap.
But if we have to pull a ring, a ring is not good for us.
Not taking into account of his slap.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a defeat.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the mind tools are called mental models.
If we only have a mental model...
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 off with a knife.
If we have many mental models.
Our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
Isn't it?
All the problems will be worried to us.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and a man's table told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
For a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
Well, me alone.
He didn't realize it.
Of what?
When I say this...
I was causing a much bigger evil.
Is it Swiss?
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was unlegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to learn from him.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example.
The less money and lose freedom, or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale it impacts.
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think how to act.
And the fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they didn't make us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those expressions generated emotion, fear.
And fear generates action.
That we are all stored preventively what is very good.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times...
It's important to act when we don't see or feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
Casar is one thing.
Do you feel hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward that eats what you married.
But cultivating is very different.
Do the effort now.
It's for something you're going to take advantage of within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
And preventing generates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But it saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, to develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now?
That we still feel, we don't see.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last six months?
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to residency is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and its attitude.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of nowhere.
A high school classmate that would not be 15 years ago.
You can't believe in a coincidence how unlikely it was found in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same. Are there so many unlikely things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was the best, the intelligent way of coexisting when the right man.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
Of serious things, even if they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
Why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I was zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And for people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
We could talk about people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
An interview Borques 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interview asked me, "That's what you answered to me."
This same question four years ago.
Borphes, I don't know what has fallen.
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be in account of new ideas.
From the new ideas that are emerging.
And to be always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the cost of a man, the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will get a good husband that you will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
A manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
While it was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, it was one of every 19:30.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 6 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910 (Applause)
In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize (Applause) But France's science academy said that she didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here had already finished elementary school.
The university, Harvard, has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, a woman is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was this idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
Help your husband.
which is a irrational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them, removing 5000, maybe, they believed in this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all revolutions...
Politics we have lived in economics, if you are nothing beside this, we are putting aside the idea that truth is true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world that exists out there is out there, we'll ever understand it.
When you say that it doesn't exist in facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we've convinced it's on September 24th, because all of us here agree with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreu, Jewish, or any of the calendar 500 or more that exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think: Happy!
We are part of a very strong social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
Cats live without calendaries.
My dog, Chiap, Alqueador, and who is this world alone at home?
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I didn't know what time had come back.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
A pomme fell, went, wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
If the trips had passed, met the animals he saw, all those that had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The wise, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born.
But if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with activity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing happens with what we are thinking now, and the same thing, what we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that there are no facts, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
The revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women, look at all the creative energy that humanity was lost by thinking how women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that copy was created to study this process.
which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, "But how, the Greeks, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between..."
People of the same sex, peppers, women or any other, transgenere, that can imagine today.
They always existed, in every culture, at every time.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But he had never thought about it.
That the sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally, was created sexual identity.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Víctoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You'll do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to blame you, it's not true, it's a great social control. (Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
No, that's it.
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it, and then that's a terrible social control form, because it dominates us, dobly, on the one hand, do you know we can't leave it, it's as if we were deprived of eating?
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals, during a century, were terribly persecuted throughout the world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women previously, or the Jews or the blacks, that neuroscience has been from slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some cases today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood, this has just been raised now, in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
to be exhausted.
But in many parts of the world today they are completely legal. This was possible for the paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed ones.
Spread your identity.
They respect each other and then make others understand that they're also human beings with a full right, but there's a drama of social struggles and that one has to get into jail that discriminated me.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
(Laughter) For them to respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, so they respect me as black, just black and the same homosexual.
And gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people, that I might not want to cost as a guy, what do I know, but however, we have to take that?
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
From prisons.
(Applause)
It's been 50 years old?
Look how old I am.
I was a homosexual boy.
I didn't know what a homosexual child was, but I didn't know the word homosexual, and they didn't even say to me like this: "My school friend told me, "Did you, dumb, we're going to pick you up." (Laughter) "Hi, don't look at me."
And I didn't even know what it was to be a trophy, nor dumb, or homosexual, or anything, and at the same time.
I knew that caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was.
I came back home, from school, and I saw my father, who loved me, looked at me.
And it made me feel what I would have done so bad for it to come out like this.
What was that?
I had to learn that it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To adjust the identity there is.
What was the positive side?
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got into a terrible prison, which was to make 24 hours out there.
I stopped being a person.
I am a person, like any other person in the world, I am against dictatorship, I am complete, I am complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual.
We are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also good to someone, say I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
20 or 30 years ago this idea had been having.
That it comes from understanding that there are no facts that exist ...
(Laughter) (Applause) There are contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it: we are contradictory, there are no facts, there are contradictions and contradictions are also interpretations.
There are no facts that interpretations exist, that means that I got into a jaula, they got me in a place, I had to assume staying there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said, and when I took charge of it.
Because when an idea is incarnated, it's that it doesn't move, while we have it only in our heads it's not useful.
I made her body, I left prison.
And leaving my prison was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause) Have you ever told me?
That there is a list of things we need to survive, called the basic canot.
What a weird idea, to live constantly with this rough, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
Does it achieve the things we need to survive and if it better had the things we need to explore?
But exploring is something difficult, scary, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement brings us extraordinary situations, to adapt is a moment.
It's long or small, full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
When everything I did, I've erased by someone else's voices.
Your voice, I'm not in a microphone.
To double the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstacle it.
But once you say it.
Once you can get rid of your words, you took a avalanche and ideas that come to you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain and you are about choosing, seeing your paraguas and covering them, or doing a side and your dad has each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy, of returning, jumping, or running.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not bad.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, the movements believed them.
Designs that take us to moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that will probably not be an artwork, but would allow you to revive the exact way in which those stars were seen.
The formula I saw that face when I spoke about what I liked the most, speed opened it to your heart.
Or how did you break when you spoke about that voice?
That forest knows you so much, that knows you're probably looking for something you've lost.
That voice.
You are your best friend, just always out there.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little pile to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend.
Without that, without that, it's a mechanism, I can't survive.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Music) (Applause)
(Video ends) Who taught you to swim?
(Applause) (Music)
What we created in girls cities, I'm sure that we once said.
I don't mean the opportunity to get out.
Great, no way to be!
So, a little bit like that, I went to the hospital there.
I can't progress in the way I would like to.
That's it!
There it is.
It always appears on the scene a person you'll see has already entered in years.
He leaves and with a belly, remember his experience, but finds America.
What come to remind us that all the past was better?
Great!
Is this really the case?
Or maybe?
We don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
When we think about this.
I inevitably remember my friends throughout my life.
Ten white, white and Emanuel.
These photos you're seeing there.
It's from 2009 when I live in high school.
What can I say to my friends?
I really want you.
They are like my brothers.
And they are three people super capable.
that as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to be able to study what they liked.
They stayed here in the city.
And be surprised, until today.
You can't get a job that allows you to fulfill your dreams.
While me, it would be the port in this picture.
The mark of the absence of opportunities was also present.
My parents, who are workers.
They made an effort on human beings that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that fears and I knew that if they stayed here in the city...
I could study something, but probably the future as a person would have short opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
Designs in the middle, I'm still among one.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress ...
It's because of a speed that surprise us all.
And it collapse the borders and the barriers that insist on people.
Does this context have?
Cities to make more and more important tales.
Let's go to the sincere, they are our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68 percent of the world's population will live in a city.
As if that number doesn't sound.
It should be almost aware of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more people choose to live in cities...
That is to say, where we have a greater chance to progress.
Great!
What does this guy explain then, while the weapons of cities seem to stay in time?
Others make progress, they're vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that you want you to be engraved here.
When you leave there with that door, you go back home.
What is this?
Strange.
If we want globalization to help us in the city to treat more opportunities for people.
We need to go out strategically to the world.
Part of my concern.
As a professional future in the field of international relationships.
That's exactly what happens.
To connect cities.
With the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminated manner.
If we don't pay our strengths, our potentialities, huh?
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you may ask: How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through the project "Concretos."
What is the quality of life of the population?
And they avoid migration to other places, they look for a better future.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, so you can see a couple of things.
Or start?
Suming a fifth, for me, the girlfriend is the group.
Do you know what it is?
It was drinking something from the castle.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of proportional investment relationship is given.
As they improve the quality of the photos of the phones.
(Laughter) Some have a couple of tips, what we were in it, we are going to improve.
And we'll have to be better fight.
Do you know what we share until today?
Beyond the deep time that we have students with us?
The folk marks the lack of opportunities.
Franco?
For example, which is also one of them in this photo.
Great!
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2002.
It was national.
But nowadays, even if you want to dedicate it, they had geography teachers.
It doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday.
working, simply, to be able to live.
Then it has to be polite.
I believe it's in my strongest left, that just then was his birthday.
How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces of our country?
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, since then we are changing career without being able to find what he was really passionate about.
And I can't even get a job that allows them to some economic independence.
Finally, it's Manuel.
It's a computer genius, but it's not the genius, you can see anything.
Do they tell them?
All day working in his place that built from nothing itself.
What a university, I studied programming.
And she can't develop her potential if she believes in what she likes.
Because they can't treat necessary tools.
For lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
What?
We, as young people.
Do we have it?
Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
Right?
Recently in English, I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 cohetes worldwide.
To participate in a weekend in New Delhi, the capital of India.
I traveled in Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
And...
Besides saying it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot.
But yes, two things I would like to share with you.
They are accidents.
In my one?
There are millions.
What?
I will never be able to say this with sufficient emphasis so you can understand, but there are millions of opportunities outside.
For all tastes and colors.
First of all.
You have to be willing to find them.
They don't come alone.
And in number two?
But not less important.
In our human resources, as Argentines.
They are brilliant.
We don't have one that belongs to young U.S.
Neither the Chinese nor anyone.
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
What do you have?
And a state that is there to come out to the world and bring the opportunities to them to act to develop themselves.
Once again.
We create better cities, go out strategically to the world.
I remember it?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, I found myself to go to study.
With three days to turn 18.
They were me, very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be told in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to have a city.
Why study?
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Why is this?
I became something again.
Who's from my friends?
And nobody you know?
It's necessary to give them tools to our youth.
so that they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
I said, "Look, calm!"
Who's more beautiful?
Taking wings to the city that comes to you.
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine how brilliant.
What would have been blank?
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Why?
And if today they were in one of the security forces in our country.
Or to laugh so far, Emanuel.
If I had the necessary programs to keep on accessing what they like.
Is it true?
Like that!
That's it?
You see the lack of opportunities.
Thank you!
Sound.
And I decided to tell it.
Don't you think it's enough argument?
Do you want another example?
That's fine.
Hey!
It's the tattoo.
And she says: "When finally?"
Or it is overwhelmed.
Deep depression limits.
In which I fell, I'll have to go to university.
Right?
Two intentions of suicide.
In countless, psychological sequences.
He told me.
Thank you very much.
If we want these things to stop going?
We have to go out strategically to the world.
For fire?
We don't eat a final point in our cities.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm a surgeon.
Since always the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work ...
We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years?
My research ...
In my case, in the sofa, it was based on searching for the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
Of course not alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
We do this with biological platforms.
They are like maps.
We give them to the tissue to use their own ability.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies ...
We can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What happened before -
It seemed like science fiction.
Today it's almost daily, it's amazing.
Undoing my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate gave me a lot of satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients that prevented having to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
I have more and more work.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
And I would like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Chorus: Here.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese, and in my work for many years I've had contact with literary, sociological and anthropological questions of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to ask us a first question.
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium?
If in January, the first case continued, being so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
(Laughter) To have the population of the third older people in the world.
Yes!
The second country has more smokers per number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
And the identified one, but a linear progress.
Until now.
We know that this new virus chron is very contagious.
In these theoretical data, Japan introduced us a cocoter that would enable a great propagation of the disease.
Basically.
Many people, not so much.
And a fourth of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society.
Education in such a way, that answers in an organic and united way.
In front of any event that compromises her.
It went through wars, tifons, tsunami.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
For day, 1,000 earthquake.
Generation, after generation, has had to support disasters.
Naturally.
It is generated by man.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performances in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
The directives, social distancing.
And hygiene and individual behavior.
Whether in society or in our own homes.
The Japanese population has not established for hundreds of years ago.
So, you don't need to say no to embrace yourself.
Don't give up because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most of the workers in public spaces use singers.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
We don't have to indicate not to sweat or stubborn on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use Barbius when they feel cold.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
(Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that two Western teachers did.
In a school, in Japan.
I mean, you'll surely know the sillas' game.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less.
In each round.
And this experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves E.
It chooses this way of being.
In other words, it's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
Audience: Yes.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works, it helps itself.
Because every enemy contributes to the good of everyone.
(Applause)
