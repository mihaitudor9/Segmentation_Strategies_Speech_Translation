Very surprising.
Right?
How much is it?
What moment did this bring?
Audience: Oh!
And we see?
And why?
Great!
We had a vision.
Oh, yes!
It's the script, the instrument we go, the protagonist.
From our music little by little.
To do this, we change.
To play it.
The way it might sound at the end.
And it can be achieved.
Audience: Great!
Fast.
And I live.
No, he lives in Buenos Aires.
A: And I tell her.
What is this?
That is, it's called by video, each one gives up their parents.
That's how the other can play on them and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this evil.
That's it.
So it's a patient.
And relatives of those who don't recover.
What are you seeing?
And the choices?
And they wake up to see them.
But there's another new thing in this bread of me.
Something that we dedicate to checking the content of social networks.
And we will fight with that information.
We had already seen it.
And not worrying about this new idea.
But during the pandemic, it releases it.
To Norway Moeve?
There were already Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
But their consumption goes beyond global level.
It gives me a lot of work.
to the pandemic, COVID-19.
And it's the first pandemic.
What does she live with my approach?
Who knows?
What is the disease?
The WHO, the World Health Organization.
It defended it as a practice of spreading fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called it like Aterda.
Because it creates foreign panic and anxiety.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
And we know it.
But when it comes to health issues, it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect.
What can put in danger is our life directly.
We don't have an idea at all.
Of the amount of waste.
That they circulate on Instagram every day.
And I said, "I am."
In Twitter, and of course a WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they bet without a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of uncertained content.
In fact, four weeks ago.
How here?
Of course!
without rest.
Checking.
I have fake news.
S: Designers.
Do you see measures?
That is, they circulate on this new disease.
And me, you know what?
But we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information.
And it's impossible.
And sometimes it's fruit.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
Pinculated to COVID-19.
Can you?
Great!
Or classify yourself in four categories.
Do I think I'm telling them?
You'll be more prepared.
And are they more prepared?
What do you remember helping us?
Aral was the information dance that take care of us.
The four categories are simple.
Well, the first one has to do.
With content related to the origin of the country.
Comparative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them from Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
I had no instruction.
If you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus, don't take it seriously, shock it, there is no sun evidence.
The second category is related to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper.
He proved that the virus lives a few hours in the air.
It made millions of people repeat and some media published that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related.
with fake news.
Girls and jury are the most dangerous, it is the one that has to pay more attention.
To those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making us drinks with hot water and salt or making vapor is drunk to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
There's no Cuban land.
Why did he create it?
There is no Argentinian that has already discovered.
I was with a savior.
Science works all machines.
To find adequate treatment and medicines.
But now it doesn't have an answer.
Well, it's totally satisfied.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures.
Oh!
To look at different measures to the opposites of authorities.
Oh, without the farther in Argentina, the day it was discourded.
The preventive and obligatory social warming, like 15 days ago, or a little more.
There was a failure of credit that said that quarantine started 3 pm. that day.
And, obviously, it made quite a result.
There are also content.
What do compares between countries to prevent what's going to happen, but they do it without context?
Or others you encountered with, who say you'll fall on the Internet.
Not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And that's how it scares us.
That we will not only have to be.
Encerrated at our homes.
Yes, not in communications.
Deinformation is in general.
Try to create panic.
And they are worried.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health organization or the Ministry of Salud, unfies.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned.
Those who dedicate us.
A Chicher, Chequeal, Tiki.
And why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
We're not comfortable.
Well, when are we missing to do?
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask your favor.
If you receive a content, it's not cheated.
I don't share it.
Let's replace comparison with doubts.
It's so common.
I don't share my doubts.
We take care of them.
If you receive a content.
A: From there.
And I discovered that they lack.
My Tecash.
How to act?
confirmation.
And with affection.
And if you did share a content.
And then you realize.
What fake?
But don't fall.
Disculpate and correct.
A: That.
GB: It's not dumb.
A: Yes, not from living.
The pandemic is dynamic, the infectologists tell us about it, the sanitarists.
Functionaries all the time.
There are changes every day, science works intensely.
To get the cure?
But it needs time.
In the meantime, there is a void of evidence and information.
We have to be capable.
Maybe like a before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
We filled those empty spaces.
With blue content.
Because we are not capable.
To tolerate our ignorance, we'll be.
Much worse.
What has the soul been like?
23 years ago.
The one I work to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working is a means of pain.
Well, from other people.
And it doesn't make you a person, bitter, or sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And to be thankful.
Or for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe?
And in a different way, no, as we wanted them to be.
And if we can't see a miracle.
Well, in an act.
reconciliation.
No, no, no.
Yes, of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a tool.
What empowering!
And that allows you to do a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
And insecurity.
And fear.
that generate the close presence of death.
And I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty, to be humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
When despite having done everything possible?
And the result is not what I expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
And they are suffering.
And in conditions much more adverse than ours.
And that allows you to put it on.
Your own problem as perspective.
And finally?
I learned and I continue to learn.
That it's not just about healing.
Well, above all.
It's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivate love and compassion.
Or they help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate.
Or love and compassion.
that they can't lie down.
It's a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Why?
I'm 40 years old.
So, after having written several novels.
I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
And I realized that it would be inevitable to talk.
One of female micro-comeditions.
From my condition as a woman.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for desire?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
Well, for a woman like me.
I don't have to decide good night.
Am I a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves to say?
I had a lot to start my research.
about women's condition.
It was a topic there.
It's quite written in many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
[A.DE.]
And in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Exactly, what?
Half of them?
Of humanity, its name.
And the other half are women.
FR: Half of humanity?
Is manliness?
AC: And the other friend.
Is feminity?
Anywhere?
So, does it ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
They would have told me I was going to write a book.
about women's condition.
And I would have surprised myself.
And maybe it's angry.
At 40.
Well, I am enjoying it a lot.
Is it a topic?
It's so evident.
But at the same time they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams.
Everything was disappointed.
It's frustration!
Different.
A: Oh, no.
We just have to go by, it's on the street.
To see that humanity is divided into two groups.
What do you walk differently?
That they dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I liked my research.
And by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If not, it's going to risk.
And the causes of these myths.
Studying is more.
Viologic?
Physiological.
Psychologists.
Technology?
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
And it doesn't matter, the sky is everything.
In most languages, man is so much the positive side.
Like the neutral pole, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
And women?
Is it the other?
I mean, the other one.
Women.
FR: Second sex.
The second sex.
Women.
CR: It's not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that it's in the history of civilization.
Many times, excluding groups are created.
Excripted like...
Black people excluded as projections, or Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They say "us" they identify themselves.
However, women.
That is, they don't identify themselves easily.
PK: They don't say us.
In fact.
Let's see, a white woman.
Or will they identify themselves more easily with a white name?
What about a black woman?
It's a funny woman.
What if you identified easily with a funny name?
What about a projectory?
Women are not a community.
And women?
Well, they don't say us.
Because they live dispersed.
Inside the group of men.
Why?
Al board?
And it's quite satisfying.
Creating and feeling the king of creation.
Until the anti-feminist bear.
A: Did they see it?
Teories in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In discussion, it's philosophical.
Many men usually ask me.
A: Do you hear that because you're a woman?
Of course!
As if it were for having ovaries and uterus and rule and hormones.
It will take me away.
So, any objectivity.
As if they were writing their children.
You look at you!
So they didn't have their hormones there.
And their texts "terone," showing them what to think.
Well, what I want.
In other words, it's conscious of these differences and understand them.
Sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
And within all that I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
And I'm going to tell you something.
What about women's behavior?
It's not dictated by its naturality.
but for culture.
Nature is that?
QD: It doesn't dictate society, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
CR: In other terminals.
QD: You're not born a woman.
Should I be blind?
What are they useful?
Bast and privilege.
QD: When I got closer to New York.
I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized.
How does it bother me?
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
Is it?
A complete, integrated individual.
It's integral.
A lot of women fall in suffering.
Because man explains that it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Go back to Sclava de Suez POceau.
To have children.
to dedicate them to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
Therefore.
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
It's conscious.
To recognize these differences.
And how do you feel?
What can you make decisions?
CR: With price.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman.
And each man?
(Laughter) And you have to decide.
But above all, what he wants, for his sexuality.
To talk about what he dreams.
Not seriously, in family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
What if you want or not to work?
With free choice.
FDB: Libre, will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together.
Well, between men.
Imoquery!
What do I want is that we feel?
That when the second sex...
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a society.
Complete.
Boom!
I said, "Of course."
And women, completely complete and free.
Audience: Yes.
Good afternoon, I guess you have studied for today.
You surely know the steamer, a hypno.
In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go on.
It was like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And in the end it says.
And this slope these thoughts for them to be told.
To suffering, it's worth it.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
Are all ready?
Also, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home.
DB: But now.
Because you know them, right?
(Laughter) Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
It was a group of mine in my school.
I was going to get married by the job legalization.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me no.
In any way, I was very young to be there alone.
that scared of what could happen.
So I told him, "That's OK."
PK: If you don't want you to go with that.
And I accompanied my voice.
And my mom?
And that he couldn't steal a parade from Alfonsea's time.
I come with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
I look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a lot of surprises.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls.
PK: But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
All of them.
And there are villains that oppress.
We have to discriminate against others.
What do they say to be more?
And there are teenagers in all.
And kids like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, then.
And the attitude I see many teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a distopy.
(Laughter) It's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change.
And then they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change.
Well, where are we the youths.
Those who are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal.
Isn't it?
And anywhere where they do a death bag.
There must be a garden.
(Laughter) And, of course.
Also in a pharmacy.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
(Laughter) On the contrary, I think it's present in all areas of our lives.
In the culture we consume.
Well, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
And then what?
Because sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me.
To pay attention to the people who make xenophobes comments.
Or by discussing political things.
While many people do it well.
Is there more?
To not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
And besides, it's worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting for me because I'm from the mouth and the river's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a difference.
It's totally artificial and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why a relative of mine makes a macho comment.
But, am I going to discuss him?
And if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or the legalization of abortion.
Well, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
Well, I talk to this person.
Well, I listen to your opinion.
And I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
I think of these things.
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
(Laughter) Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
And when many say: "Beautiful streets."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
and rejuvenate our present.
I hope that more and more we start to see markets and political spaces in general.
I mean, not as dangerous, something that scares.
That is, but as a space of personal and social growth.
From union and inspiration and I hope there is always, but there is always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without a little surprise.
PK: It's full of kids.
Thank you very much!
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a wall like this?
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
It was like that of contamination.
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
That's how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN, who attended every day by global action by water.
A couple of days ago.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings.
Well, do you?
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the manantial lakes.
Through agriculture.
From the livestock of our big companies and even from our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
Or, it is the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
It's according to the World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people to 2016 live without access to drinking water in the world.
And this implies.
That if we selected 10 people randomly, from any part of the Earth, at least two.
You won't have serious problems.
Or to have access to water.
Through that number of people.
At least 60 million of them are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
And since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
And we'll realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry.
That the country was lit.
with largest hydrical reserves in the world.
Do you have at least 30 percent of the population?
And without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even further, to these two countries.
Almost 20 million people, around 20 percent of the country's population.
She lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us think.
How is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth?
And they meet in front of this situation.
So, exactly this question.
A: The one that...
And he made four friends.
Great!
Let's leave it.
And what do we do with bags?
And we got together to bring drinking water.
thousands of people in Latin America.
From Mexico?
Funding like this from Guatemán.
Very good!
The car's plate.
We call it faith.
And above all.
We got rid of a tremendous gap.
We don't have to give it back to anyone.
Yes in you.
Where are we born?
During the way we were going to meet with rural and white communities.
PK: Sometimes they have thin water.
So, all of them, I could go to poths or supporters.
DB: To power.
Well, but always with a problem.
The water has this pinea.
Good afternoon.
These communities usually have three villages.
To purify?
M: Is the Bible?
Directly.
Excuse me?
Sure.
It assumes a huge cost of resources for people who practically don't have.
There's money resources to buy these subsidies.
With time resources, to go pick up the sign and then go.
That asked us.
What can we do to help increase this problem?
Parting from the basis that we weren't experts in the matter.
We put them hands to the play.
And after many weeks of research.
We found a system.
from filtration by members that were perfectly adapted.
The logistics of our project, but above all, the needs of this test.
I'm going to teach you my future.
It's a filter that works practically like this.
A goal.
DB: The water counts.
And this retains.
Many more than with a molecule.
Stop passing his crazy man, now!
(Laughter) Retening in 99% of all.
It's their substantial.
- No, not only health.
I'm systematic.
PK: The most efficient for me.
clean water of quality.
Well, immediately.
Let's see.
It's a completely revolutionary and considered system.
A: The same weight of water to make.
Can you imagine?
And the impact of these painters?
In the lives of all places.
Well, that's it.
We want to tell you a story, it's Leo's story.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community.
But it's funny, both him and all his poblado.
They used a lot of money and time.
to get drinking water.
As the abasteded manandial was very polluted by the skeptical stages of the king.
To our move.
And Leo signed up in an English course.
Can't you imagine?
So, the illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
And to fulfill among other things?
So choose.
And the truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on?
There are more than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua.
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
They will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now?
Thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago.
When it was Guateman, a project.
It was an idea because we realized a bit of the dream we had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
We had never been alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign, which was destined to 100% of exclusive purchasing.
More than water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together?
Have we created a social movement?
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
Well, but there's still a lot.
There's still a lot there.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
Can it be one of the risks of the greater risks?
The one facing the human being in the next 10 years.
According to the world's economic supply, what don't we hear?
Is it a stupidity?
We call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible?
And having reached this situation.
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
It was in the West.
We have created a lot of necessities.
That we all know they are unnecessary.
I mean, sometimes we don't think.
What do other people suffer?
So that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
Well, we in this project.
But we have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
Where have we seen?
As big embotellers, they were appropriating themselves.
from the local earthquakes that supported communities, therefore they were completely taking off the access to water they had.
What do you think you are doing?
For those land.
Well, the great oil producers.
The big oilfield.
Well, for us, all of us.
Or can we fill our cars' deposit?
What they are doing is to contaminate.
And it's destroying forests and rivers.
From communities or Auranis of the Amazon we've been there.
And it's amazing.
And they are making the communities have to be displaced.
And it has a future.
This will probably cause.
And it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible.
And living it hasn't left us.
It has left us something that has opened.
It's really something that...
It seems and we really think it seems.
That it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
That is, it's a reality.
That not only.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The world's world crisis.
And it's a reality that...
November 12th, 2016.
And it is directly affecting us.
Absolutely?
And each one, feel in this room.
But you don't need to go very far.
In California?
It was with a technological development world.
They are mutating people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
RB: For several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffered Equiel.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
The more water houses will suffer in the future.
What if it really was?
And we want to make a change.
No, really.
We want to impact on this planet.
Well, what we have to do is all of us.
To recognize ourselves.
Well, what we all have to do is to motivate ourselves.
And it's learning about these problems.
And what we have to do is also educate all our children, all our families.
Over what are the problems and the real needs.
And with that?
But what are the solutions?
Because they will really be sustainable.
Well, what we have to do.
It is to support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
This small NGO that is trying to build forces in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Why don't we try each other?
Farming a little pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really be?
Let's change.
These big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
Do we really have to?
Appreciate and value.
Is the incredible luck we have?
To reach our homes.
Opening the glass of water.
And what always?
It always leaves water.
Or isn't it like that?
And let's go, please, leave.
To harm this resource.
And we don't think so.
But...
Believe me.
That is to say, it's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
But we have to act, we have to raise awareness and act.
And we have to do it.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
Existen.
Many voices to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
That's it!
It's our way of doing.
What is your mind?
Wait for what?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I'm going to start the conference by making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
That emotion has a thousand times higher than thought, the electromagnetic frequency that generates a thought, is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what always said in my grandmother: NENEM.
And I've spoken from the heart.
I commit myself to you.
And that I'm going to talk about from the heart.
And open your heart, surely you can receive 1000% of what I'm going to say.
So we got stuck in our minds.
We certainly receive only one part, so that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines.
To put ourselves in context, how is society today, raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
Fast.
He stood up!
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
It's an accident of toothpaste, OK!
(Laughter) In my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you've seen the answer that...
They were old, right?
And then another question came.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy,
(Laughter) Those of you who cry happy, raise your hand.
There are around 500 or 600 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
What are you?
What are we?
So, society is not there.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they'd always told us more or less questions, they would have told us in that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Oriented to the crisis.
And when they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
DB: Everything that's wrong, everything we see, if we're tied to the media.
What information?
And the answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids and we tell them: look for good news.
How many good are bad and neutral, the money of the day, how many good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Now, that's it.
This is what happens to us when we naturally ask an impulse of how we see society.
Another big problem that has to do with athletes on fashion, when I ask this once, they say: " football, vasque, rugby," well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sports.
And why?
And we complain about everything, they saw this, that is, first we leave the weather, heat that's 3 in January 3 in the afternoon, or how crazy, how cold it's 7 in July at 7 am.
First we leave the weather, then we leave the traffic, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something, something is wrong, when they ask me, how are you perfectly fine, it's a happy dish, he tells me: "What happened to you?"
DB: You don't complain about anything.
So, we've become a society that's funny.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, so it's a disaster, you see what this is, and this has to change, it has to change the country, the society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into claims.
In other words, therapists, claims.
And the maximum: Opinologists and all logos.
Would we spire from all of you and you realized?
Have you ever heard of it?
That's why I don't feel able to opt.
And after we get everything, I provide it with my friends, there's a friend Ferrando.
And I go to the t-shirt with him and I tell him.
And I said, "You see drums without drums in that place." "Oh, do you know why you stay without batteries, because it's the place, you see you climbed the soy?"
Do you know why the soup was up?
(Laughter) You get that pain is going down there, because we know everything, we choose economy, politics, and...
And here is something even more worrying: we have started to have our mind oriented to the crisis.
And we complain, complain.
And we are immersive in opinion, what does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also took a MW.
It's a charger, for the doubts that it doesn't have much load, but with our energy.
So, oh!
And we started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
And we need everything to change.
That the country in good shape, that the weather is not the case, because recently I was overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the cure which was wonderful.
And the kidney says: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society above all in our generation.
What have we left our society in a moral crisis that wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine?
We are affected, risky, but we are badly believing our children.
I think we are for nothing, we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
And we don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how is this phrase represented there?
Do you see how architects are?
And what do you want to be in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
But if we believe in generations that well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived, leaving me, which was an hell.
So talent...
So I looked for more knowledge, more abilities, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude.
Multipli.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
And you?
And the attitude you have in front of life.
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimist guy, you are a heavimist guy, and if you have a merde attempt, he does a sort of merd.
PK: Sorry.
So I started to say, well, how do I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, my attitude changed, and everything changed, I had a decision to change the attitude and everything that happened to me and I started to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I would do.
Who searches for the changes I wanted to see?
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justifying, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the protagonist of an installation is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And for me, and you see what here in this square meter, I vibrate with the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world.
With a shirt that says "I respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see.
I started to decide to live in a different world because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I was going to solve it and I told him, "Tell me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was hell and I was in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
There was also mine, in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place.
And it's a decision, because I have hell there next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
And if all the time we'll be waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
And I started educating.
And think there are many ways to educate.
For me, only one with the example: every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So it's already in the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see.
Through our square meter we have to emit energy, first, the main altitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things. Being a protagonist is people for change, it's not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And if you are with a pessimistic group, it's a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, that's a failure, that makes you a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
And if you start a square meter, to contagiate solidarity, optimism, I started to emit that energy, why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
And from where you are, the important thing is not what we do.
For me, the important thing is that what we do is do it with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo of side a helplessness doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "Pequeas Pelices" and she tells me: "These people were born and I, in the first one that made me happy.
And I tell him, "Hey, you told the 300 happy people, Paqua, I'm not."
What are you waiting for?
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
A: What's up to you?
A respect?
I respect, emits encounter, emits gratitude.
(Laughter) Unconditional love, what is emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy and according to what you metaphere, is what you receive.
This is like AMCM, if you're in AM and you go from one coast of AM to the other side, you'll listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody, and it's more in FM, you have the LOM.
The frequency you want to hear, you can choose.
But if you are in the DM, even if you go from one end to the other, you'll listen to it.
In other words, the world is how we created it.
They live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get up in the morning and I begin to say, "The first game is playing against me," "Hey, I get up, I don't go."
Well, I wake up that a progress with bad humour or with good humor.
With bad humour or not, with good humour, well-disposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
(Video) They are all decisions, all small differences: excellence or media creates this difference, the path you take is a blind as you wake up.
Their victims or protagonists will show what you want to build for the generations that come or will be functional to the interests that today are governing us and taking us from domesticated noses.
People drive it for fear.
And my father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Why?
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences.
With this foundation, my borders, the great blessing I invite you to see it.
To know what we were doing, they were going to happen. We gathered veterans of war from Argentinians and British, a british board, a burk, and who gathered to compete with the Argentinians and together gave a meeting message that nobody, right?
And do you know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew, do you know what he said?
The Earth proves, what kind of unit of measurement is it?
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
(Laughter) Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a second is born.
I invite you to see it and I'm going to tell you two life stories.
I had the blessing of living with the Markuy Foundation without Borders, it was the year 2012, I went to work soja of gas to a conflict between realities and prestigies that had been 70 years old.
In one place?
So, when I became careful, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
And I understood what.
All the time I was worried about what was missing. One morning I see a Palestine woman in Belén's city embraces other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration, so I say.
What are they celebrating?
So she says, "The water tank was filled with it."
What does it mean that it has drinking water at home to drink every week?
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
And they celebrated it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
And do you know what the genius is in lamparadine through the translator?
And they told me, "I have no idea."
So I'm going to explain to you what that genius is in the hamparadine.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me all excited and says.
And they gave my hands of hot water.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment?
But if all the time I was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink, if I could give a bathroom, if I would have...
Where to sleep?
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
And it stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had.
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
It's going to take three steps, it's true.
The first step.
Well, I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
I wanted in my eyes.
Can you imagine if at this moment?
All the things we have to never give them value, we don't give them importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to bathe, to have water.
To start making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
It's like our senses, our friends.
Things like that!
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
And the second part of this exercise has to do.
Well, with all the people in this room.
Now you feel, what have you been?
And...
Were you born or selected or chosen by all you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things you've done until now?
That is, they express that gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding the strongest thing you can shout, doing what you want, express the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life if you feel it right now.
From this moment on, I start standing and applause to myself strongly.
How strong, I want you all!
Dreaming.
With what we have, with what we receive.
For the love of our loved ones.
The abundance is the one that sleep.
The things we don't realize were.
For the protagonists we can be in our lives.
They can shout, they can join the chairs, they can do what they want.
We are in a society at a bended moment, very well, very well up.
(Applause) Well upwards, this is the gratitude we have to express.
Everything we have?
(Applause) Barbano, Barbaloist.
Great!
Great!
What is full of?
Keep there for a moment.
The longest path to go.
And it's four pads.
When we managed to lower our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Not everything we have, but everything we do.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
And we managed to turn off the turn for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
This that we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Is it to the genius of Aradin's lamp?
So he asks him what you will start.
Thank you!
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we are going to travel.
If we go to hell, or if we go to paradise.
Thank you very much.
And to music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And it's not necessary.
Being an instrumentist or being a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin.
In pulsa.
Let's go.
Do you know the Sun?
Look at me!
But music also lives in the pauses.
In silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
And music is a language.
Since we are little and we play with the sound as if they were toys.
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go all together and grow in community.
Music?
What does ritual generate?
To accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Why?
Isn't it?
To face.
Where?
So I stayed.
"Bullying."
(English) bullying those physical or verbal aggressions.
That usually occur in schools, that's why they're also known as school support.
And it's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems.
And yet, 5 or 10 years ago.
What do I think?
Shorts or none of us had heard this word.
Very good.
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new.
(Laughter) What is it about?
It always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age we have, we have an experience with this type of situations, that is, because we live it in our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, our poor colleagues from then, in childhood.
Or because we simply press it, before it was called "Take a point to someone to mock."
Now I know if it's bullying.
Well, but I think that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, right?
No, you have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
And this for various reasons.
First, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
So it wasn't news, the media was not discussed.
We didn't try to promote laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Why?
I didn't know what could be a cause of suffering for many people and, in fact, it was, but it was thought it was more or less normal.
An unwanted consequence, an lateral effect.
Undesigned Colateral from school coexistence.
But not that serious, right?
And some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that, at that same time, or even, not so long ago.
Other screams were considered much more serious.
That those Telets without importance had occurred in recess and in hallways.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now going out, they tend to do the opposite, right?
The bad grades and the disciplinary repriments seem to be increasingly serious.
Well, less serious, sorry, and this new bullying phenomenon occupies a more and more central role.
There are simultaneous and complementary movements.
So, at the same time, not on one side.
These are more reasons.
Is there more traditional humiliation systems?
Finally, they are castings applied by an authority, as a teacher.
Or a directive.
Students did something considered incorrect.
Is there something forbidden by regulations or something considered that shouldn't be done?
Maybe how to behave bad or not?
On the one hand, that loses weight.
And, on the other hand, they earn priority.
Isn't it?
They are school humiliation reasons.
And that's it?
And that the same students apply to each other.
For the most different reasons.
But why?
It's always related to physical appearance.
Or with personality.
DB: That's it.
DB: Well, that's it.
But happening, the question would be: Why?
Why is it distort?
Aaction in our values.
Yes?
Why is it a big historical change?
No, a big historical change.
It's about what the pencil goes.
Because we think that on the one hand ...
In those reasons of school humiliation, those confused.
I don't know what it is.
Really?
Supporters, expulsions, bad things.
What operates.
It's the guilt.
Sorry for having done something the same.
Anyone?
Where?
An internal emotion, private emotion.
It refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each and himself.
(Laughter) For having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect.
I know everyone think that's it.
I am me.
I feel guilty.
Why did I do something?
What's your model?
And it's not the fault what's at stake.
but another kind of music.
It's embarrassing.
Basically the same, it was quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
And it doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong.
Or something wrong.
In the case of embarrassment.
The problem is not me.
Or, if not, the others.
The rest.
It's the look of others.
I said, "What a judge!"
In an incorrect and fair way.
Sometimes.
Beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty at all.
They are us who exercise my that cruel look.
So?
That's it?
Transformation, and I think...
With the transformation of balance.
embarrassment is important.
And I think this is a key to understand.
Because they are changing our priorities.
Why does it look like me?
Because the look generates, the look of others.
What was obviously always there?
It doesn't matter.
Effectively, he got a weight weight.
Perseated!
But, above all, when you get to play.
Now, who is each one?
And how much is it going?
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course it's a very good change.
A complex.
That it's not from now, it's been generating for decades.
And it's finishing of consuming now, it's crystallizing now.
(Laughter) I think one of the most important ingredients.
What information?
Is it like that?
It was abandonment.
From the idea of interiority.
How many times?
(Laughter) It was a very important idea, a belief.
It's fundamental.
That was the last 200 years.
And it did 9 out of 20.
And the conviction?
Of what did it exist?
Well, inner life.
Or something essential?
But invisible to the eyes.
And it was believed that it defined each one in a much better way.
Profound and true.
That is, the vanish appearances.
And those appearances?
In other words, not only they were considered wine.
but also fake, private.
As something lower, it doesn't matter.
Compared with all the dissemination of that inner truth or beauty.
Well, I think all of this...
These are values and beliefs that still remain among us, but that we are abandoning them, these days are transforming and we are abandoning those beliefs, for example, in the case of good appearances I find it pretty clear that they are no longer so low.
(Laughter) No, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in the last decades of importance of the personal image of the physical aspect, the theme of gyms, esthetic treatments, all of that.
Yes!
It also matters a lot and it's called meaning each time and it's what you see.
And this notion is lost that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that it's not the trips, not that it's inside each one, but that it's not the perips but an immaterial thing.
Like the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increasingly believe in this and more in what others can see, what we show what we do.
And according to these changes.
The others judge us from what they see.
And less from that notion that there's something inside, eternal, medium-sized internality, an anti-sized area, that would be more real than oxygen.
They are actions and appearances.
Together with this.
We find a series of indices of transformations.
And one of them would be self-promotion, right?
They are optical autoproduction practices that are everywhere and what?
Recently, it was considered a bad taste.
No, but let's think of an example: conquest, the obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "I like."
No, this also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos.
Until plastic surgeries.
Scattering through reality shows.
And for bullying.
But thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
When amonestations and bad grades?
They are increasingly less serious, because it seems that fault has lost a lot of their moralizing efficiency, that is, fault is no longer so effective.
Or like embarrassment.
That is, to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
(Laughter) Two.
Stories that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves.
The others have to do what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to grow and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk.
That this alien look doesn't turn you to admire, but rejection, mock.
It's also ignorance that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
But let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying when these moons are...
Or about famations?
They disseminate on social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc.
And then, what they used to be private before, to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the walls of the school or the house, suddenly.
It exposes to millions of people, everyone knows it.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, much more serious.
What is this?
And we don't have where to take refuge.
Honey inside yourself.
I didn't have intimacy.
I mean, not even dreaming of escaping an island somehow.
That is, there are increasingly less or no more, at least no wifi, which is the theme.
QD: So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection.
And the profiles are always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependence we developed.
I mean, regarding the button I like it.
No, that magical click we expect everyone to consider ourselves in front of any selfie or whatever we post with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) Well, if all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be...
Now, what do we do, too, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad?
How do we solve it?
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues.
Does it seem to me as much guilt or shame?
Well, they are mechanisms of social control.
Isn't it?
And the fact that it will cover it...
He is losing or purifying, that's not good or animal in himself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind.
That is, it's a fact.
Because if we continue, which means things changed in fact, so if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we don't try to solve as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far.
That's what he wanted.
I received her days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
We wouldn't forget these days.
One of the people told me.
Mamm, I want to live a historical moment.
DB: But of the good ones.
But the doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength, in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us, without wanting.
To explore, what happens?
In a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I'm thinking a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think so.
And we are learning some important things.
And I would like to share three of those ideas that I walked around in these days and that I hope there's one of those ideas.
They serve us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, all teachers together have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Innovation is something we're talking about to close.
But until now, they were happening isolately by separate.
And from one day to another, everyone simultaneously.
And we had to help to take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance.
And in that process?
We are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
To reinvent the wheel, there were many things already available, but we had never had the urgency in times in need to use.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social media, videos called.
Which means that it gives us the result to keep teaching.
And especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do.
It's the one of our tool box.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings.
We have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to have patience and do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
And we take the taste to try new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
(Video) Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't follow in these days, they show themselves bigger than...
He started to show how the compound to make bank tricks to people of his age.
We're learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
And just like it appeared once and again.
And the boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed was...
A space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn?
When and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially when only teenagers.
Learn better when they can organize their own times.
that some were more at night.
Others start with the subjects that are most interested in.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task, or changes in the web, to end up understanding something that doesn't happen to them.
Or to learn the new ones who wanted to.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working peace.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
And since I saw a little.
organizing their time.
To manage tasks and all that requires to learn to learn.
And my last reflection.
It's more of a question.
What happens when, what happens?
These days.
We don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school.
It disappears stronger than ever, as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if it's happening to our days.
We realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
It may have a calm place to study and not.
The one here has to ask and not.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home.
And they don't.
GV: The school.
Well, with all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
Well, they are protected.
And focused on that.
GB: And on the surname.
As an educator, I'm very concerned about how all this will follow and I also wonder what will be left of what we're learning in this fourth grade.
My feeling is...
When they get bad marks and they're on the naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes.
And also on the beach some treasures appeared hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
In this historical moment, it's not for the good ones.
It helps us be own.
And those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relate to the use of time and ways of learning and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
A: Yes.
But physical works are closed.
In one of those I'm opening a door to keep building, among all of us.
Well, when all this happens.
It's the education we dream.
I dreamed a lot about the rural quarantine.
Almost months and suddenly.
And we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control.
Conduced by trucks in short a ring.
From his home.
that doctors were operated by telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good no.
To the distance education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up by 7 to M.
We have to study a bit asleep.
I dreamed that the State workers understood.
Finally, Bubble Drail's work was rejected in the spread of conspiranóid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions before, peanphiles, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for smoking and I dreamed.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, we appreciated a button.
That is, free buthuana, yes, or Simhuana Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then we always earned most of a day for the other quickly.
(Laughter) Without Northern Senors, nor theoretical deputies, deciding the place of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also like that.
Money gave them the curves on YouTube, and of course it was forbidden to emigrate them to Youtube Kid.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported lawyers and judges.
And that from one day to another, all those who had ever been rights, had to learn how to play an instrument, how to sleep.
Making something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert.
And what about in the end?
We got used to buying in the neighborhood's businesses.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from far away with the chest, I dreamed that we would become monogets, but really, what about the single people?
They quickly looked for love in the neighborhood and started to coexist because the same thing they did before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that united who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
(Laughter) I dreamed that the TED talks we had to see them at home and do it at home and that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it was difficult to leave.
I dreamed that the State ...
And it would send us a 3D printer to each one.
To be able to buy imported products.
I dreamed that at night, in big cities, stars would meet again.
They were doors like in the field and in the field.
They were all of a sudden wild hair and lobo.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later, the government announced the end of the pandemic.
In a very short communicator, the president said to the town that it was possible to leave home.
That you could make a normal life, leave saying the president, occupy your jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed July 9th.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked to the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal and without wanting.
We suffocated it and killed it.
And that a sintriculing truck shocks against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out of their house.
In the box.
Take selfies out with the dead avestruz and steal wine and screams.
And soon someone joined another and the journalists showed up again.
To transmit the massacre live.
And then, over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
I think that when you see a photo ...
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
What does this mean?
That photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it.
So a few years ago I started actively.
I told him, "Great!
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So I gave up this challenge.
Let's do with detachment.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what you are there.
Capturing.
Isn't it?
And the idea of what to know.
It helps you see what you see in front of you.
In other words, as a walk, as a visite in a place with little friends on Facebook, that we draw.
AD: And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
You have to look closely.
A few days ago I asked my mom: "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks?"
They only try 30 seconds.
A resident!
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things.
A person.
In those 30 seconds.
In other words, I would eat the last one with a cream that was staying at the bottle.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until Kar.
I started to see everything that this person had published until the date.
A girl that's about a month ago.
I had uploaded a photo with the elderly number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I assumed I was a very friendly person.
In the publications there were some bench art pieces.
And I said, "That's it, this girl likes it."
Something that later I could confirm with some photos she looked like painting.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
PK: What is a trans girl you're at school last year and who's currently studying graphic design?
And among all that I could also see what a healthy person is, who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so he is very respectful with the environment.
But, when are these ten things already?
They had passed 28 seconds.
And my mom was very shocking.
I couldn't believe that I could know a person like that, through social networks.
Do you remember that in networks each one chooses what they want?
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is.
DB: And what he wants to be.
Today, I think there's a way fundamentally different from knowing another.
People, comparison and as we did a few years ago.
Right?
Everything I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
AC: To go from a general idea of that person, to get to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can know.
The first detail is the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then with all that, to make a general image of the person.
And understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
And my generation?
Is tolerant?
Multicultural and it has a great social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
Well, I didn't play it for him.
And that didn't work as a barrier for me to know it.
Or why does she choose to show us their reality?
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
So, after making these species of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like in which I spoke about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself: What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like that, how am I going to do?
While I was talking to my mom and eating my very deserved me, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized.
It's a format.
Is it so different from meeting other people on social networks?
He spent screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
But I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everyone and without playing.
And, obviously, I ask his user.
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
(Pre-recorded voice) Hello.
The eyes.
In different parts of the face.
They talk about having somewhere.
Effectively.
Some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build a backward look.
But it's also true.
Northificial gifts.
The kitchens of the mouth, the borders of the ears.
The pores and details are useless.
They were fundamental elements to form what we would call.
And it's the look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
What is it?
And it was the faces side that the spectators searched.
The elaboration of a portrait is to highlight an subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada, and at the same time it is looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought about it.
What would it be if we could see how I look at a spectrum?
In a team of positioning in a laboratory of neuroscience we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
That's what we get.
And how do we build the image on the chemo?
How?
Because our eyes choose specific parts of that face.
To extract information, since the rest of the brain forms it.
If we put all the images together.
And looking together in the image, we could see which relevant parts.
It's time to put together.
So, the portrait, and what is not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
So we thought about it.
How would it be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others?
We built it was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This brief message for the "no" journey.
What is this?
One, in some way, is Monday.
Some of the projects led together to Mariano Sigman.
an intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Sounds.
And me, mom?
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally, what encourages us.
It's the search of this kindness.
The questions.
And the exploration.
At the moment?
What do we do?
And we started to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life.
That's more natural for human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
How many resources in living more and more years?
And even so.
It seems it's a stage.
We don't want to get there.
Nobody?
It doesn't want to be good.
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues.
Many people asked me.
What are you so young taking care of old people?
And it's my future.
And I answered, "I want to live for many years and that's how I'll go."
And what they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
And it's fear.
Fear to be good.
Fear?
To live in a society?
Where is the most important thing?
Yes?
Or seem young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They keep losing value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
PK: Meet.
And let's go to the sea.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age.
But they continue being socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities.
In laborial searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
It's that many times.
And we don't notice them.
Or those of them.
These stereotypes.
And they embrace older people.
Let's see some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They get sick or depend on others.
When the data of the vessor of social debt.
"You see?", she said.
70 percent of the elderly people, today in Argentina.
PK: They are self-beatable.
Does it mean that they can take care of themselves?
Taking care of others.
Or this shared belief?
IDV: That the oldest stantists or depressed ones.
when it's 80 percent.
And it says to be happy.
And that's it.
And it's much more than what people in my age show.
Or even younger.
Audience: Oh!
And how much?
It's not like that.
The passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Why does it not represent?
To so many older people than today.
They are working, they are creating.
They are doing sports, participating in volunteer.
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful.
And they have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
You know?
And the difficult thing it is for someone.
5 more?
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
It has shown me.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However.
I've never found it.
I didn't have a scholarship.
Not a call.
I didn't have a funding opportunity.
That's what includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
It's the majority of public universities in our country.
There's the matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed backwards.
I was a young adult.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just one.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with college teachers in anybody.
It's cool!
They are invited to get rid of their ages.
Cinema is the chronological limit.
I studied in the 1969.
You can't teach class.
And at 71 no.
The media.
But they aren't helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them.
Every time.
It was about people's topic.
Do you know?
From the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove.
What locates?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
The press has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults.
And the third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
DB: Great!
Ansy!
I still don't find a word.
that identify the according to everything.
The only one that suggests to avoid.
His grandfather or grandmother?
Except they are their grandchildren.
Why affection some of them justify?
And if it's affection?
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
Men older.
They have a name.
Like everything.
Would it be like that?
Thank you!
Shouching?
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina.
Thank you very much.
In the two.
It will see older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group.
Great.
Who's there?
I remember the world.
We are now.
It was an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
It is born out of fear.
If we complain.
We would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate.
Create employment.
And to design new products and services.
A new longevity.
It opens endless doors so we can rethink the next years.
And what about the economic?
In social and cultural things.
And I'll give you an example.
And in this country.
One out of three older people?
And it says it's a need for recreation and entertainment.
Or not satisfied.
If they had the opportunity.
They would continue studying and training.
But, however.
Office and education.
Think about it.
Almost exclusively.
For children.
I said.
We can't detect intuitively.
Because the elderly.
Very different.
What does it answer to us?
They are traditional trones we still have in our heads.
Anyone?
Well, many of us still.
And let's go back to that time.
That's why.
Propost!
That we listen and learn from that.
Are you older?
To really understand what their new needs are.
They are their new possibilities.
Narrator: Deceive.
Igô.
A while ago.
Entrevisting an older person.
What about me?
One remained clear if they wanted to be activities with people of their age or with younger people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to go.
Think about life.
Ah, in life.
It has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes.
Let's face them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the ones.
Don't worry.
We are the ones who are going to do.
