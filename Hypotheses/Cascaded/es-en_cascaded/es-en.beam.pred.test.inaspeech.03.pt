(Laughter) I have a message for your children and grandchildren and I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
We need to learn to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water, with that feeling of ungravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, turtles, molamous fish.
And from fish from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature, it was a mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a little fishing fish.
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was an intense spiritual feeling, and you're thinking, "This teacher is crazy, spoke with fish," it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
And...
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
(Video) The work of 24 hours during a week to draw that work of art that we're going to see and that I'm not crazy, or on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that mandala we see, proves that nature has awareness and that I'm able to talk to fish.
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
Last year, Science magazine published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between pregnant and predators, that is, for every four smoke there were three lions.
Or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
So, paradoxically, as amazed to this same mathematical pattern, is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
(Sigh) Okay with the Cliver's law?
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
But the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I ask myself: Is it a simple coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
So, after thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unite the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of human beings, I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here they give you a summary.
And I remember with scientific consensus, with the explosion of primogenite life on Earth kept in very simple levels, during the first half of this period and the miracle of life, between 3800 and 500 million years, the planet Earth was formed between 4 billion years.
Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that Cocoa has about 4 million years, if it seems to indicate that the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed, and especially since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 million years ago, human beings have adapted the environment in a significant way, as something unsustainable.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, only one species, one more unitanean, is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy, and all of us are responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs, but the human being keeps trying to destroy everything around him.
A: This half of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And although it seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees integrated.
And if that was not enough, future generations are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we leave in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
So, since the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020 it's been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
In other words, according to the world's forum of nature.
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours, but we don't have four planets, right?
So that's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater and we fire the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources will be able to develop in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
(Laughter) While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in all forms.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running fighting, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not competence, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players together with all the technical body behind it.
Our body is a pluricellular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradoxically, but human beings continue to create linear thinking ideologies, but human beings continue to create linear thinking ideologies, suffered meteorite glacial disasters and constant processes of trial and error.
Doctrina is political, like anarchism that failed communism, which also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has failed, it has more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
In other words, they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that it takes care, because nature advises to obtain economic benefit, we have sent garbage to the outside and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
And it's something that's inside all of us, we all have that university, and I invite you to meditate, life imitation, but it's not new, the indigenous peoples have been doing this since thousands of years ago.
What happens to you with this window, of imagination, how engineers could, architects, economists, be inspired?
But well, they thought of making a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
But the Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites?
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
With this blue turtle.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
The worst inspiration is almost infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature ...
It will be there forever.
Many economists tell us we have to manufacture and build.
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Can you imagine it?
I'm going to tell you a future for dialogue with your children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me, "Daddy."
At least you tried it, you fought.
And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What we have to say is that the fourth of our opportunity and the pandemic isn't an opportunity, it's horrible things, the pollant we're not going to do everything we lack, but it has many complicated, polically, economically.
We feel bad, socially with good, we fool ourselves to our friends.
This horrible thing, there's nothing to do with this, and not about why thinking that it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of and that we are not going out of something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
We learned to move, to move death, we always did it, and we will keep doing it.
So.
We're going to do that now.
And what I didn't have, thinking about Andrart.
It's an idea in which I've been meditating, from a book, and there are a lot of movies, some of their movies, called "Modern nature," from the cinema it's from Derecho Hermón, it's the newspapers that call "The 80 traditions" from a book.
But what he decides online is that he will buy a land instead of a horrible hospital and he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
As a person writes.
And for him, taking care of a kindergarten was not having time.
It wasn't, well, to spend the time.
No, like now that we spend the time cooking to San Pan or whatever, or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing, we do if we see the dishes, not the only tasks they promise are those."
And I thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From the Fri of Gengers, basically, and who later took particularly the next feminist.
To talk about reproductive work, not even productive work, which is what puts new things in the world, we can say, always my father or a slap, it doesn't matter, and this reproductive work, which is what reproduces the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, workers so that the next day the factory puts its own pedagogies.
That reproductive work is also work, increasing, moving.
But in general, what we produce, what we carry on is that reproductive work has economic value, because the erase of being in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value.
Moreover, why don't we do as Boder Ejeerman and think that this difference is contrasted between productive and reproductive work is a rather fictional difference given by one side?
Of course, the gender, for the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are productive, reproductive, for women are important, and also due to modernity, and for the idea that the subject that is valuable is the subject that makes the original, that produces the new in the world that the subject that takes care, for taking care.
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it makes you an artist, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't make you an important person, right?
These are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, even if he says care tasks, the most important ones, short days?
We are living without publicists, without writers, without a lot of things, even moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps moving, but the world doesn't send themselves spinning without food and without care.
And without nurses and health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
Is it eating?
And heal, and clean.
And without that, the world revolves.
So?
These tasks have a value that is not relative, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, but not only something mechanical that we have to go above, that I hope there would not exist, that I hope you could do this, clean almost, cook or solve food.
Maybe, we can think like that, we have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Ayarman is that...
We can also live them differently, we can live them as tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which we are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking about this that the title is not nature.
It's also something interesting.
The care relationship with our bodies, we think we have to take care of the body, the gym, we have to cook, just to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
She looked at me.
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are and that the body is going to be something we have to overcome.
I think...
This isn't an opportunity?
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
No, we all live now in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
Of course, the world needs more soap operas.
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
And knowing all schools and all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with care, with others, and doing all that?
That's why, in fact, when I was invited to do this, I almost said no, because I thought it was, I didn't have to give an intension of an original idea, the world hadn't been that novel and the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write, bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I had with my books and that can be useful for other people, right?
More than writing it down and more than doing.
Fourth.
Thank you very much.
So, the second aspect is practice, just like the phrase you need to know, drink with moderation depends on us, like everything you like, that says that when we spend more hours without eating, or it's normal to see fruit all year, if you restringe, fast foods, and in many cases, food will guarantee you a conscious decision, and at that time, the decision-making system, and at that time, the food we've consumed in time, and in time, like everything that there's no need, there's no strength, there's no strength, there's nothing, there's no strength, there's nothing, there's no strength, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, and there's nothing, nothing, nothing else, nothing, nothing else, there is nothing, nothing.
Now, some time ago I've been obsessed telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first one that happened obvious to me: Marie Curie, they didn't give them a Nobel Prize, they were given two, so it was worthy of their pedestal, I recently heard the story of Ugeneas to serdote, among them the most important thing was the one who brought the vaccine against polio at university investigating.
Eugenia works actively until 2004, and they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her, and you know that in 2011 she was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
And how I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that this made me find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were, but above all to not lose those who are, thank you very much.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They are bouncing back from the century in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas went into our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond to one letter, each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It's because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that guided most of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological, the one who says we have to write, according to words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stayed with them, which sometimes are asperal as in people.
And sometimes they sound waves like in cats, so we stay with ces, feces and zets.
There are three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
All of us went to school, we invested large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that plastic brain time, childly, indicated.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full of exceptions.
We were transmitted in many forms with implications and explained the idea that in ortography something was key to our training.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that complied ortography?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
Antography is used to uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read, but in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example, in orthography.
With puntuation, I can choose to change the meaning of a phrase with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no, with ortography or it's OK, or it's wrong, as it is fair or not, the right standards.
But then, wouldn't it make sense to simplify the current rules so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
Wouldn't it be meaning to simplify the current standards so that all that time we dedicate to teaching ortography we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity if they deserve time and effort?
What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not to pursue ortography, when ortography simplifies, ortography does not match the quality of language, which we use it following common criteria, but it also seems fundamental to me that those common criteria are the simplest we can, especially, because if we simplify our ortography.
I work every day with the literature of the century of Ourolego, Agarcilazo, Aservantes, Agongora, Quevedo, who sometimes write men, without H, sometimes write with Becort.
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between those texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention still at the time, but not of quality.
But let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story, I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive with the teachers who hurt us and hurt us with ortography, but the truth is that when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the block of fair, the educator of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is being written, you can become an object of public mockering at once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography, but we shouldn't forget.
Throughout history of our language, we were always teachers, or individuals related to teaching the first letters, those who encouraged ortographic reforms, sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, strandings, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the biggest ortographic reform that had indeed occurred in the Spanish language, which was the one in Chile, in the middle.
In the 19th century.
Because then not taking the post of those teachers and start moving forward in our orthography, I'm here, in the intimacy of us the 10,000, I'd like to put some modifications on the table that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Yes!
We chose HMuda, where we write a House, but we don't say anything, we choose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argue, not with one, let's eliminate the other: "Go, hijota, let's divide the function, what kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone, all the mistakes that cause the sound, but."
Jalabe, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it cannot be an absolute principle, in some cases, prediction differences should be attended, now I said before, it feces in some places correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
(Laughter) Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not that much.
The real Spanish Academy, all the gyms of language, also believe that ortography should be modified, and that sometimes the attachment to history, to traditions and customs, becomes an obstacle.
For today's use, this explains in fact that our language is much more than those we know, that those we have geographically close, went from theater to theater, we were of quantity, from symbol to symbol, and from now on, some ships move away in the dictionary of the Real Academia, harp, harmony, can write with H or H.
And we're all fine.
Does it sound like me anyway?
This is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
That are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts and incorporates, this is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the dramatic level, and almost I would say it's not true for the level of ortography, which have always fixed the rules and proposed modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment to this day, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks, but at our time, the time of social networks, that is suffering a revolutionary change?
It was never written as much as now, never so many non-violent ortographic uses, where even people with impecable and pereducated orthography, when they write social networks, they behave quite similar to how most users of social networks behave, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize the speed in communication right now.
There are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention, because they are probably telling us that once they are assigned to writing, a new place, they are asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do wrong to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a more attempt to meet the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with simplified ortography, we will recover etymology at the same place where we go now, to etymological dictatorships.
A second objection that comes from those who say if we simplify ortography, we are going to stop distinguising the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem, our language has homony, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
What about me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, which is the one who say: "I don't want to change," "I don't want to change my eyes," that objection in part is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used and wait for time to feel the new rules?
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits is in the prudence of consensus, high level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we get, so I think we have to agree, that academics have to agree and clean our ortography all those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't work.
I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest field, but important of language, we'll be leaving the next generations a better future.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at the ashes of my father to the microscope, and when we look into the mirror, we are caressed by the cosmos, it became more adivine that at the beginning of my life, and this other had the coffee eyes with a lighth around the rhythm.
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
Shouldn't we create an IBAP of education?
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
Many of you. A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should come to the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management.
Well, the first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advanced.
(Applause) Today, I'm not the scientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From great loves, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here and now, at home, we stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, worldwide obsession could buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Well, it has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than with relevance, the answer.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy it.
It's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology, called "the optimist blind."
The same goes for many of us to drive or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in reality, nothing will happen to us.
It made the major politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up inculpable or stigmatizing.
For example, at the bobonia he rushed the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States, when, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were those that were really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, Japan has been proposed that everyone uses more chairs.
The first thing makes people who are among lower know or contagious, and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you only use more stages we get sick, know who's sick and who's not for if you wear or not more chairs.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid self-esteem and this.
Enjoy us all.
Maybe what we've found the most in these days is our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that we really need motivation to do it.
This discovered it now, for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that was extremely difficult to change them.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the awarded need, and the world keeps moving.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to limit individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also to govern ourselves and other public sectors have the capacity through some technology to know where we were, where we see it, who we find and also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our viral load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this cost can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way, which is so risky, can come out.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but less people die, and we can do it in a way to stop economy and the world in the way we've done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that it was a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: if I had the beginning of the pandemic.
I put that choice if you feel good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe we give our data in a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free and care?
Are they going to fly less arrogant in the sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we also realize that taking part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever.
What do we want it to be the conservative sex of the coronavirus?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patabone, in Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nothing.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples," are part of the sea's wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea dollar broke, they burnt into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me and taking me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
It's a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000 for 10,000, those are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was like 100 million years ago, I've traveled some of them and I've studied fossils from different parts of the planet to try to point out how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, South of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
B.G: Naturally we think of these forest landscapes, lagos, near the Andes mountains.
But for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the critical period, this is already about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common mechanisms belonged to a family called "abelisáuridos," while for that time, in the northern hemisphere, other families of carnivores fell, like, for example, the tyrannosauridos.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the North Hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
The Mantoklaves, especially 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs, for the first time, completely dominated the planet, for the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the herbivorous niches of omnivorous worldwide.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagone Law.
And that leads me to one of the stories, in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon.
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
You see, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the trail of a dinosaur, I approached, stopped next to me, I shooled.
I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and Bello knew it was, after studying years of bones and anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the trash part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really?
I couldn't believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
After warning the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given to the winter.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found, or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day of the stadium.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way its skeleton.
And that's where the stairs really begins: to launch, layer, those sediments that were burning.
Where it opened us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time, it's coming back to the surface.
An animal?
They lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The animal had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
(Video) After that whole pack of buried rocks had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's crust and a raise.
From all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking from those hills looking for.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizures, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before what we thought: long before the South Hemisphere and the North hemisphere they separated being due to a big ocean, at the time of panaga, when all continents were united in a supercontinent supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we really do them in the lab, we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
You slowly and that's why this didn't open up and we call it "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very special.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur, a very, very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 feelings from the end of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur lines didn't seem like at all the forms we contracted or knew about the northern hemisphere, studying its rests, we could see that their closest relatives had been found in South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other in this period of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean is still not formed that separates these two continents today, but once again, we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Living on climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a big is true in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy who had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these faines, it wasn't a full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs ...
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really find fantastic, fansifascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of the body size in life history, have diversified and achieved all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
BB: The Earth is a great book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
And life occupies a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages still by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, its keys, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays, it's fundamental to know its history.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Yes!
It's also key.
To project a future, thank you.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dream of healing.
To find magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
So time.
It gives us a happiness bathroom.
Through the subway, you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
You see empires invading small villages and you don't have the position of panoramic to defend them.
But something like that as a child.
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation that has to live.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea I'm going to tell you about.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Going back to our mind with him.
Power and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
Besides these rings, fix bicycles, they turn around half.
They go to the bar, ask for coffee with milk, with three months from some of Manteque and eat them.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
They develop us the habit.
We need to think and give time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I done the saying?
That now the one with only one milele sees problems as a cloud.
But if we have to pull a ring, a ring is not good for us.
Neither realizing his slap.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a beer.
To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools are called "Mental Mental Memes."
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 off with a knife.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to broaden the box of tools of our head.
Isn't it?
All the problems will come up with us.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and at the table on the side.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or because of a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told the teacher.
But it didn't realize.
Of what?
When I say this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In Switzerland.
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was unplegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to learn from him.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another more important scale.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example.
Management, I leaders freedom, not freedom and lose love.
When we act, let's think about what scale impacts what we're going to do.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act?
The fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And impresions have emotions for us.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they made us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those expressions generated emotion, fear.
And fear generates action.
We are all now stored preventively what is moving.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Casting is one thing."
Do you feel hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward, you eat what you married.
But very different farms.
Do the effort now.
For something you're going to take advantage of within six months or a friend.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But the organism creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But it saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now!
That we still feel, we live.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
It's walking through a little town in the middle of the ship!
A high school classmate that would not be 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same. Are there so many unlikely things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible, and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not to think just about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible to serious things, even if it's very likely.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
That because once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And of people to cultivate these ideas.
We could talk about people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
An interview Borques 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewee told me, "That's what you answered to me."
This same question four years ago.
"Moro did", I don't know what I thought.
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be accepted with new ideas.
The new ideas are emerging.
And to be always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
In other words, women are irrational beings, always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the cost of a male, the family rational, the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will get a good husband that you will have to take care of.
(Laughter) This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 19:30s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 6 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here were already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school that just in 1965, 50 years ago, is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was this idea that women only use to create children and help their husband.
which is a irrational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, women believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them, removing 5,000, maybe they believed in this idea, it was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived a few years ago, if you're true, there are not facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, in neurobiologists, in cognitive psychologists, they are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not everyone, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world that exists out there is out there, we'll ever understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only social interpretations exist, are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretive frame, which day is September 24?
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we know it's on September 24th, because all we're here agreed with the Cigorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the 500 or more calendaries, every thing we say, every thing we think, every goal we live without a calendar.
My dog, Chiap, Alqueador, and who is this world alone at home?
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I knew it, what time had become.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked here, was a manzana, and wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels had passed away, to know the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc., besides...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The wisdom, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born, but if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing happens with what we're thinking now, and the same thing is what we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation, that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that there are no facts, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field, the revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years, they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost humanity by thinking how women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
In other words, wrong ideas are monstrous, there's an idea we can make.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that model was created to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, but how in the Greeks and the Romans, and the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other transgeneree that occurred to you today, have always existed in all culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But it had never thought that the sexuality of an abyss, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Víctoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You're going to do it, but it's going to blame you, or the man of your fellow man, that is, he's going to blame you, he's going to blame you, and on the one hand they know we can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
(Laughter) Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals, during a century, were terribly persecuted throughout the world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women previously, or the Jews or the blacks, that neuroscience has been from slavery, we don't even talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some cases today is ideal.
But we all live much better free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals are still condemned to be fusiled, but in many parts of the world today are completely legal. This was possible for the paradigm change, and why this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed, assumed their identity, to be respected, and then, they are also human beings who have a full right, who have a full right.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
However, I have to accept that, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, so that they respect me as black, and the same homosexual, and women and Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complex, complex, contradictory people, identity is a jail, perhaps the most terrible in jail.
From prisons.
50 years ago, in which old Sun, I was a homosexual boy.
(Laughter) You don't look at me, and I didn't know what it was, I came back home, from school, and I saw that my father, who loved me, looked at me, didn't know what it was to make a homosexual boy, I didn't know the word homosexual.
And it made me feel that I've done that bad for it to come out like that, what was that?
And I had to learn what it was like, I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
Do you have a positive side?
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world, I am against dictatorship, I am complete, I am complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I am also a person, that is to say I am complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea that was having.
That it arises from understanding that the facts don't exist, that they exist ...
(Applause) There are contradictions and it's going to say, because it's really that: we are contradictory, the facts exist the interpretations, that means that I got into a jaula, they got me in a place, I had to assume to stay there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said, and when I took charge, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
Hello, or they told me: full of confusion, where a list of things we need to survive, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to explore, but exploring is something difficult, terrifying, each moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement and everything you know disappears.
(Applause)
When everything I did, it was paid for the voices of someone else, each of these ideas had, my story and a microphone, once you could get your words, you took a avalanche of ideas that come to you at all speed, that take you to moments, like a dance class, that seeks to exterminate, and that life controls music, the movements you don't stop laughing.
Stories that are kept in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that will probably not be an artwork, but will allow you to revive the exact way in which those stars were seen.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give yourself a little pile to save that sea of possibilities, and at the same time the first one is in that shore, that person is a better friend, that voice that you know so much, that knows that you're probably looking for something you've lost.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without a dunk, I can't survive.
Until today, 68 percent of the world's population will live in a city, and as they don't count with the necessary resources as a professional future that I'm telling them in real life, that in which successes and progress, if ever more people, in which what I want, if we want, the mark of the power to do almost hundreds of hundreds of people, which are an effort on human beings to study what I like, in relation to me, to me, to me, and to me, I can't progress, and to society, and society, and society can't reach the city, and that people can't go to the city, and that people can't go to the city, and that people can't go to the city, and that people can't go to the city, and that people can't go to the city, and that people can't come to the city, and that people can't come to the city,
So, inevitably, I remember them, my friends, do you know what we share, as they improve the quality of the photos of phones, the brand of high opportunities?
For example, it's the one who's fine about this photo, but today, even if you want to dedicate it, I had a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be from Monday to Monday working in his place, which has built from nowhere itself, it was a national champion of the loneliness of geography in 2002.
(Laughter) Time studies programming and it doesn't even have the necessary programs.
This is that I learned a lot, but if there are two things I'd like to share with you, we have nothing, we have nothing, we are patients, and besides saying that with incredible experience, to participate in a weekend that the only Argentinian in that event is not millions of opportunities out there.
You have to be willing to find, because it's very difficult, you can never tell this in public so that this doesn't happen to you, it doesn't happen to you, but not less important for you to stay in your cities or anyone you know, it's necessary, but everything surrounding me, you know for the first time, for growing from there.
Imagine how bright it would have been weird or how much, if it had been able to completely dedicate geography.
To not go so far away, in Manuel, if we had the necessary programs to keep hacking.
That's how we see the lack of opportunities.
Yes, all this doesn't seem to be enough argument I just disappointed and wants a success.
This is the tattoo that tells me, when finally I was able to overcome the unique depression in which I fell for having to go to university.
After a lot, two attempts of unnumerable suicide, psychological sequences that told me, a lot of overcome.
If we want these things to stop passing, please, we don't eat a final point to our cities, we have to go out strategically, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm a surgeon, since always the surgeons...
We thought that to have more work ...
We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years.
My research.
In my case, in the sofa, it was based on searching for the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
This can be done in several ways, for example, by looking for genes to detect early diseases like cancer and not having to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair by themselves.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
We do this with biological platforms, which are like maps we give to the tissue to use their own capacity.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What seemed like science fiction previously, today is almost daily, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more and more patients to operate gave me a lot of satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients that prevented.
To have to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
"I have it."
More and more work.
Now I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Why?
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese, with literary, sociological and anthropological of Japanese culture, and in addition, in my work of many years I've had contact with social and individual issues, they can help us face a crisis like this.
Well, it's worth making us a first question.
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium?
If in January, the first case continued, being so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
In other words, having the population of the third older age in the world.
(English) Being a second country with more fumers per number of inhabitants.
Why in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear advance and identified one.
Until now.
We know that this new virus runs a very contagious virus in these demographic data, so Japan presents us a cocktail that would enable a great propagation of the disease, basically.
Many people, not so much.
And a fourth of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
And Japanese is a society.
Education in a way that answers organicly and united to any event that compromises her.
Japan passed through war, Tifions, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, after generation, natural disasters, has had to overlleve co-generated by humans.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
Social distancing directives.
And it's full, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether in society or in our own homes.
The Japanese population has not established, it doesn't embrace hundreds of years, it's not necessary to tell you about hundreds of years ago.
Don't give up because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
That is to say, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
In fact, a few years ago, studies show that this is a habitual protocol between Japanese, that more than 50% of Japanese will use Barbijo when they feel rehearsing.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that two Western teachers did in a Japanese school.
You'll surely know the sillas' game, that the number of participants, and they're taking out, they put music, chairs in a circle, less than one by one.
In each round.
And this experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, were all sedating the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves is in this way of being.
In other words, it's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
In the example there are children, but we can see how a collective society works, it helps itself.
Because every immigration contributes to the good of everyone.
