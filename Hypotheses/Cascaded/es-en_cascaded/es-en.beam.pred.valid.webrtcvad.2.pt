We are, I'm celous.
We do our profile to the window with biodiversity.
There's the instrument brought by lands, distant and music, orchestra.
The Chinese?
The one that avoids the sacred match.
Audience: Yes!
We had a vision.
Does the violence of the tools we play?
Protagonist.
In our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play them.
So it sounds like a folklore.
You can oralize.
My name is Ravillón and I live in Neuquén.
One of us lives in Buenos Aires.
There are beginnings we had to learn how to work in reality.
It's called by video, each one records their part.
That's how the other can play on it and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this mouse.
In fact.

(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Of course not even those who suffer me.
It's the second frequency.
So, I get sick.
And relatives are those who haven't recovered.
What about it?
I'm good at it, right?
They wake up to see a stance.
(Audience 5) Yes!
But there's another new thing in this pandemic.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the content of social networks and fighting misinformation.
We had already seen it.
Well, and not worrying about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there were already Twitter, Facebook, but its consumption, global levels of survey, and YouTube.
It's a good guy in Paris.
The pandemic, COVI-19 is the first pandemic that lives with infodevia.
What is that, what information am I doing?
The WMS, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and maricious news about the pandemic.
It's called COMATIRDA.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
When we know, but when it comes to health issues it is much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can lead to danger, is our lives directly.
(Sigh) You don't know a thing.
Of the amount of waste.
that circulate these days on Facebook, on Instagram.
And you, on Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they bet without a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
Great!
Four weeks ago with my team.
We work.
without rest.
Checking.
I have fake news.
A winner.
Do you see measures?
that circulate over this new disease.
Why?
Aaaaaah!
They know what, we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of that information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes it's frustrac.
(Video ends) That's why I think it's useful and I tell you what we discovered, something we found.
All the contents.
In COVID-19.
You can fit.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
Do I think they were telling each other?
You'll be more prepared.
And they are more prepared, maybe they can help to stop this avalanche of information on us.
(Pre-recorded voice) The four categories are simple: The first has to do.
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
The cooperative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them in Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
None of this is true, if you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus.
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category relates to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Girls and jury are the most dangerous, it is the one that has to pay more attention.
Those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we killed the virus and making us drinks with hot water and salt, or making vapor, it's virus to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
There's no Cuban land.
That he was able to generate it and there was no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications, but at the moment it doesn't have a fully satisfying answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, or access to different measures to the opposite measures of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social isolation was expelled, 15 days ago, a little more, a false credit failure said that quarantine starts at 3 in the afternoon.
And it obviously generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And so?
It makes us fear that we are not only going so much to be locked up in our homes, but communicating.
Deinformation is in general.
They try to generate panic.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source like the World Health Organization or the Ministry of Salud desconfi you.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate ourselves, check, check, check.
(Sigh) It's that...
We're not good.
No doubt.
We're not comfortable.
When we lack certainty.
Audience: Yes.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care they should support.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, isn't checking?
Don't share it.
Let's replace it...
I begin with doubts.
It's so common.
(Laughter)
I don't share my doubts.
That is taking care of our echo.
(Sigh) If you receive a content.
Of someone.
And I didn't know what fake.
Please raise your sheets.
How did he turn around?
Enjoy me salt and with affection.
And if you share a content, and then you realize.
What fake?
Not having boxes.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not the temptation.
but still alive.
Science works intensely to get the cure, dynamic pandemic, infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time, there are changes every day.
But it needs time.
While there are evidence and information vaccines.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
"I'm sure."
That we fill those brickets with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
We'll be much worse than if we tolerate them.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
23 years ago.
that I work to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I learned to work in the middle of pain.
Of other people.
It doesn't make you a bitter, nor sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches us to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle.
In an act of reconciliation.
Of sorry?
of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool.
that allows you to do a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
insecurity and fear.
that generate the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty.
Being more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
And when despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more atterces than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
Finally, I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Why is it about relating?
And to accompany.
Cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate.
Love and compassion.
You can lie down.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
Recently...
I was 40 years old.
After writing several soap operas.
I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman like me?
Do I have to decide good night, I'm a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I studied a lot in starting my research on women's condition.
It was a topic already written in many articles.
Feminity is missing.
Feminity disappears.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately half of humanity are men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity.
It's masculinity, another friendship.
Is feminity?
So, why?
Does it ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
Have you told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry.
At 40.
I am really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time, it was so ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations.
Different to a man.
We just have to go on the street to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
What do you walk differently?
That they dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological?
Sicological?
Technology.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, man is everything, in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women?
Is it the other?
It's the other.
Women.
The second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It wasn't defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity.
That it's all.
So I kept doing my research.
I realized that in the history of civilization...
Many times you create excluded groups.
Excrued as blacks.
Excrites like the projectmen, or the Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They say, "We identify each other."
However, women...
They don't identify themselves easily.
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name?
That with a black woman.
A funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
That with a projectionary.
Women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live disperse.
Inside the group of men.
"Don't worry."
Aren?
It is quite satisfying to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists, huh?
Did they work?
Teories in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions.
Many men usually ask me.
You think that because it's a woman.
Of course?
As if I had ovaries and a uterus and rule and hormones would take me away.
Any objectivity.
As if they were, when they wrote their...
Teachers.
They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
What I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them.
Sharing what I understood.
(Laughter)
Sharing what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
Audience: Yes!
And within all that I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Is nature like that?
Society doesn't dictate, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
A woman is not born.
It gets to be done.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer.
At the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best worlds, it was...
A complete, integrated individual.
It's integral.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
Don't you think about it?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Possau.
To have children.
Give yourself to create them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
Why?
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, there's a lot.
What I do intend.
Do you recognize it?
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
With free will.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman.
And every man.
He can and must decide what he wants for his sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to conscientize.
That this effort...
It has to be done together.
Between men.
And women.
What I want is to conscientize.
That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
A: We will live in a society.
Complete.
The powerful one is.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
Thank you!
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause) When I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the hooded paper, which is a hip in search of freedom, or an hydroe that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go.
Like golden wings about mountains and colines.
And at the end she says, "And these thoughts for them to give them?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that wrote it: "You go to work for more than 100 years and us."
We can take it as our own.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home, but now...
No, that you know them, right?
Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) "Thank you, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, God, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, God."
(Applause)
(Applause)
A couple of years ago.
A group of my friends went out to marry for the abortion legalization.
I asked my other, and to be able with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, accompany me.
(Sigh) And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the phonkin's time.
He came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
He looked around her.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
Yes!
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Harry Potter leaves, the games of hunger, divergent, the chronics of Arnia.
What are the stories of my generation?
In all of them?
There are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And there are teenagers in all.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
Audience: Yes!
I'm not surprised at all, then.
The attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a distopy.
Because it's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our head in a distopy.
terrifying like the one of climate change.
Where we, young people, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Where does a death bag do?
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni (Applause)
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives, in the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds.
For me, they have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobos comments.
Or by discussing political things, and while many people prefer to avoid these issues in order to not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
I guarantee that there are certain things worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why a relative of mine makes a macho comment.
I'll discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization?
I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to their opinion.
And I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that, opinion, is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
And regularly our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see marks and political spaces in general.
And not as dangerous, something that scares.
but as a space for personal and social growth.
From union and inspiration and I hope there is always, but there is always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly.
And to say, without any surprise.
It's full of kids.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours a day?
Taking a cup like this one.
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
Was it so polluted?
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by the climate action for water, a couple of days ago in more rocks.
Water is life, and without it we wouldn't exist. In fact, human beings, we are composed by more than 65 percent of water.
Despite that, every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, main lakes.
Through agriculture.
From the livestock of our big companies and even from our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
Five?
Children per day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people per 2016.
They live without access to drinking water in the world.
And this represents that if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two.
Are there serious problems?
To have access to water.
Very good!
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
Because this continent has 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, for example Peru, sorry.
That is the octavo country with largest hydroe reserves in the world, at least 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries.
Almost 20 million people, that is, around 20 percent of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth?
They meet in front of this situation.
Let's leave everything, it's exactly this question that made four doctors of zarabota.
And we do the bags and we gathered again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America.
From Mexico to Peru.
Funding like this?
Raise your hand the bosses.
Now let's go.
I've taken the self-caravan so we call the "Ferla Blanca" and above all.
We took away from a tremendous desire to return to the world.
The luck that we have indeed had, for having been born, where are we born?
We went into the adventure.
During the way, we decided to find rural communities and hair.
Classing to see have water at home.
All of them go to rivers, poths or marantials.
To be able to see.
But always.
With a common problem.
The water and this pinete is contaminated.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat.
The Pyram, crying or buying it directly.
So, as you know, it implies a huge cost of resources for people who almost don't have age.
Audience: Yes!
Warning resources to buy these bidons?
Or resources in time to go pick up the sign and then avoid it.
And we asked ourselves.
What can we do to help increase this problem?
From the basis that none of us were experts in the matter, we put our hands to the play.
And after many weeks of research we found a system.
from filtration by membrals that was perfectly adapted.
To the logistics of our project, but above all, to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works practically like...
A swarm.
Great!
Wow!
The contaminated water goes through the child.
And this one goes back to all particles.
Mario is that with a water molecule... (Laughter) leaving getting crazy, clean water, retaining 99% of all these damaging substances about health.
Hello!
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately, and also, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider it.
That only needs the weight of water to make the future work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these filters?
In the lives of all these people?
And I said, "Well, and now?
(Video ends) We want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story, Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Audience: Yes!
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he, as all his Puebla, was in a lot of money and time.
To get drinking water, since the watermandial that was supported was very polluted by fossil fuels around.
At our march, Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride that it was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well: We delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people: Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
You will understand drinking water for about 10 years and now thinking about thinking about two years ago.
When in Guatherba project, Tanzolera was an idea.
Well, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
Before leaving, more than 400 people... But were we never alone in this dream?
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign, which was destined to 100% of exclusive purchasing.
Of the water filters.
[A.DE.]
And nine months later, fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
Well, together we have created a social movement that has made the trip of these four friends.
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
(Laughter) But there's still a lot.
But there's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
It can be one of the risks of the biggest risks of the human being in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
(Laughter) We call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
So, the reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We have created a lot of necessities that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can fulfill all of them.
We have seen this project with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those land, the great oil producers?
The big oilfield -
So that all of us can fill our vehicles' deposit.
What they are doing here is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there and it's amazing.
They are making the communities have to be moved.
And in the future this will probably cause.
It's that it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible and living it hasn't left us.
It has left us open.
It's really something that really works.
It seems and we really think it seems that it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
[A.DE.]
The world's world crisis...
It's a reality that isn't only.
The world's world crisis affects underwhelmed countries, is a reality that, on November 12th, 2016.
It's affecting us directly and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far.
In California?
A world of technological development is encouraging people to consume too much water.
They are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
A Spain.
In Spain we also suffer from drought, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the houses of water in the future.
(Applause)
If really...
We want to make a change if we really want to impact on this planet.
It's motivating, it's learning about these problems, and what we have to do is educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and special needs are, what we have to do is all of us.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
What we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption, that small NGO.
They are trying to build poths in Guatemala to overcome these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try to exercise a bit of pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really change?
Life that these big companies would say, that today...
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck we have.
To reach our homes.
Opening the water turning.
And always, there's always water.
Or isn't it like that?
Let's stop worrying this resource.
It seems like no, but believing it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
But we have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act.
And we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to change what we want to see in the world.
Luckily?
There are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
(Audience 5) Yes!
This is our way of doing it.
Well, what is yours?
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Music) Wow, how nice it is for here!
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making a commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
The electromagnetic frequency that creates a thought measures that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than thought.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: Nenny.
Talking from the heart.
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
And open your heart, surely you can receive 1000% of what I'm going to say.
And that we remain trapped in our minds.
We certainly receive only one part, so that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines.
To give us a context, how is society today, raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
Fast.
No, it's not like that.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
A car accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you gave me the answers.
And then there's another question, you've just given, right?
Now someone in this room is happy to raise your hands those who are happy.
Well, that's it.
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
Why?
There were around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are?
Why are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they'd always told us more or less questions, they would have told us in that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is...
Everything that's missing.
Everything is wrong, everything we see if we are tied to the media.
Information where ...
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids' diary and we tell them, "Be good news, bad and neutral news, day money," right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Now, that's it.
This is what happens to us when we naturally ask a question or an impulse of how we see society.
Another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashionable, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby, not well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sports.
The complaint.
We complain absolutely everything.
They saw this, that is, first we leave the weather: heat that's 3rd of January 3 pm. Oh, how crazy!
How cold it's 7 of July at 7 am?
The first ones take us out of the weather, then leave the traffic, then leave the country, well, we stop my wife.
And if we don't complain about something, something is wrong.
When they ask me: "How are you perfectly well? It's a happy dish, he tells me, "What happened to you?"
"Oh, don't complain about anything."
That is, we have become societies that jologists.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change this, it's a disaster, or this has to change.
We have to change the country, society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into claims, psychologists, claims.
And the maximum: "opinologists and all achievements."
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
Some of you have heard someone who says: "I don't feel the ability to operate this."
When we get rid of everything, it's already produced with my friends. There's a friend Fernando who comes to his head and says: "I packed two sympathies in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries because he got up to the soy?"
Did you understand that pain is going down there, that time we leave everything, we opens the economy, politics, and...
And there's something even more worrying: we've started to have our mind oriented to the crisis.
We complain, complain.
And we are immersive in opinion.
What does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also took a...
It's a chargator, for doubts that it doesn't have much load, but with our energy, it was.
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
We need everything to change, the country stays well, the weather doesn't know which, because I was recently overwhelming and I got to give a conference and watch with the rhythm, I wanted wonderful, and the ring says to me: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced rain."
(Laughter)
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society, above all, our generation.
What have we left our society in a moral crisis that wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine?
Dearded, breathed, but badly, we are making our children believe.
But we serve for nothing, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
We don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how this sentence is represented.
Do you see how architects are?
And what do you want?
We're in Argentina.
We hear this and if it were worldwide, do you know what we can do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I graduated.
That the ability was important to get out of that world I lived in, that I lived complaining, which was hell.
That talent...
It was important, I had to have talent, I had to experience and I was formed more and more in this, I saw that all of them add up, all of them add up.
So I looked for more knowledge, more skill, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimistic guy, you're a heavimist guy, and if you have a merde attempt or it's a sort of merd.
Sorry.
So I started to say, how or to get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed?
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I would do.
Who searches for the changes I wanted to see?
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justified, criticizing, rooting and I began to demonstrate.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the staggering protagonist is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And for me, and you see what here in this square meter, I vibrate with the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why I go with one.
Aisa that says "free."
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see.
I started to decide to live in a different world because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I went to the subway and I told him, "Look, I've got three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was in the winter and lived in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, mine, in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place.
It's a decision, because I have hell there next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
When it begins to claim all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
If we'll always be waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to man in many things.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
This is not all the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's just one.
With the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, these are the ways to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I am the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change the protagonist things, those people in change, are not waiting for someone to ruin my life.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start emitting energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you contagiate?
And you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare.
If you're with a group of failures, I'm a failured, that makes you a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
And you start with your square meter, contagiating solidarity, optimism, and I started to emit that energy. Why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco was to buy a pound of sides, an ice cream doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Felices" and she tells me: "These people were born and I the first one I did is happy and it's nightcuting."
And I say to him, "Hey, hippie about 300 happy people, why?"
"No, she says, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What do you lawyer for?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, what is emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy and according to what you met, it's what you receive.
This is like AME, FME, if you are in AM and you go from one coast of AM to the other side, or you're going to listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody.
And what's more, at FM, having the frequencies you want to hear, you can choose, but if you're in ADM, even if you leave from one end to the other, you're going to listen to it.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning I start to say, "The first match is against me."
"Oh, I'm up, I don't get up."
Well, I wake up, you sing with humour, or with good humor.
With bad humour or not, with good humour, well-disposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence, creative media, this difference, the path that you take is a blind as you wake up.
His victims and the protagonists.
You will show what you want to build for the generations that come or you will make the interests that today are governing us and taking us out of domesticated nostress.
People drive it for fear.
My father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Well.
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this foundation of my borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we did, they were going to happen. We brought together veterans of war with Argentinians and Victinians, a Royal Marim Británic came, a burk.
And they gathered Argentine competitories and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
And do you know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew?
It works for lives, that a measuring unit is that.
If they taught me that they were the bad guys and now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 and half blind.
I invite you to see it, I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the Berkuy Foundation without Borders. It was in 2012 I went to the Baja de Gaza, a conflict between realities and Palestine realities that had been 70 years old.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
I understood that all the time I was worried about what I was missing. One morning I see a Palestine woman was the city of Belén, she came and hugged with other ladies and celebrations, no and celebrating.
They are celebrating.
Then the translator says to me: "The water tank was filled."
What does it mean that it has drinking water at home to take the whole week?
If you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
And they celebrated it, right?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy, I ask him:
Do you know what the lamparadian genius is through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
So I explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her, "I work with you, what do you ask me?"
A kid looks at me all emotional and says:
"Give me the hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
I'll give you that moment.
All the time was connected with what was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
And if I could give a bathroom, if I would have one?
Where to sleep.
So they lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude.
I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story, I want to propose an exercise all of you in this state that we are now.
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
I'd like my eyes.
Imagine right now.
All the things we have to never give them.
Valor, we don't give him any importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to be able to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
Like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do.
With all the people in this room...
Now you feel, what have you been?
Being born or selected or chosen by all you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now.
that express that gratitude.
Speaking standing, applauding it stronger, that can yell by doing what we receive. (Applause) Well upwards, this is the gratitude we have to express by the protagonists we can do in our lives, very well, for what we have, for what we have, for the abundance we want, for the things we've received in your life, if you feel it right now, from a moment, and clap very strong.
Keep there for a moment.
The longest way to go?
It's in four stadiums when we got to get down.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we realize...
Everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
What do we just felt and this feeling?
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Is the genius of Aradin's lamp?
He asks what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why because music is already in us since we are born in beats, in poths, in rhythms?
The Sun leaves the Moon, my life!
But music also lives in pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds, since we are little and we play with the sound as if it were a player, provoked Pach, until we grew up and brought music with us.
And it also generates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, so that we can all go together and grow in community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
(Applause) Welcome to the talk and his group.
(Music) (Music)
(Music ends) (Applause)
Believe me, it's not easy to face this in front of a sea of people.
Can you imagine then what bullying must be?
Isn't it?
bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they're also known as school harassment.
It's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems.
However, 5 or 10 years ago I think that a few or none of us had heard this word "bullying."
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age we have, we all have an experience with this type of situations, that is, because we live it in our own meat.
We trained to exercise it against our own colleagues, telling our poor colleagues of that time in childhood.
Or because we simply presence it, before it was called...
Take some point to someone to get buried.
Now, that's bullying.
(Laughter) But I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, there are similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same, and this for various reasons.
First, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
So, it wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to promote laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was more or less normal.
It's capable of an unwanted consequence, an lateral effect, with the probe of school coexistence, but not that serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to the children's education.
But there's something important, which is that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school dramas were considered much more serious.
Those lights without importance that would happen in recess and hallways.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
(Laughter) Although now going round tends to do the opposite, bad grades and disciplinary repriments, it seems that more serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying affects a more and more central role.
They are the scenarios applied by an authority, as a teacher.
Or a director, students, made something considered incorrect, something forbidden by regulations, or something considered that shouldn't be done, how to behave badly or not study, on the one hand, it loses weight.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
Teachers of school humiliation, which are these scenarios that the same students apply among themselves.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change, about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts...
Amonestations, expulsions, bad grades.
What operates there is fault.
Culp for having done something bad: guilt is an internal, private emotion refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one itself, for having done something that not only regulates.
It was done that it was forbidden, that it shouldn't be, because it is incorrect.
But everyone think that's wrong, even me.
I feel guilty because I did something bad, now in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion: embarrassment.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different, embarrassment is a public emotion.
It doesn't refer to a private drama of each of us, for having done something bad, in the case of shame.
The problem isn't me, but the others, the others, the look of others, that judge me in an incorrect and unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I don't have any fault, it's the others that exercise on me that cruel look.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of the other ...
And obviously it was always important, lately, it won a restless weight, overwhelmed, perhaps, at the moment of judging who each one is, and how much it is.
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, that's not from now, that's been managing for decades, and that's finishing of consuming, now it's crystallizing now, and it seems to me one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief.
During the 200 years they previous us, and it did 9 out of 20, the conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes, that was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and true way that appearances.
These appearances are not only considered vine, but also fake, so-called.
As something lower, something without importance compared to the entertainment of that truth or inner beauty. Well, I believe that all this is values and beliefs that still remain between us, but that we are abandoning them.
And she's not so healthy.
No, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in recent decades, the importance of the personal image of the physical appearance, gyms, esthetic treatments, all of that.
(Laughter) It also matters a lot, and more and more emphasis you see and you lose that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that it's not the trips, not that it's inside each of us, but that it's not the trips but something immaterial.
Like the soul or the spirit.
It seems that we increasingly believe less.
And more and more, in what others can see, what we show, what we do.
And according to these transformations, others judge us from what they say, and less from that notion that there's something inside, inside, eternal, eternal, mediodictoriana, an anticuated medium, that would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this, I find a series of indices of transformations, and one of them would be self-management, tactics or self-production techniques.
Today they are everywhere and that it was even recently considered a bad taste.
But let's think of an example: conquest, an obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "I like".
No, this also to prove that you exist and you have value and it deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos.
Until plastic surgeries.
By going through the shows and bullying, but thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
When intonestations and bad grades are increasingly serious, not because it seems to be guilty.
It was lost a good part of its moralizing efficiency.
That is, fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
Two facets that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk that the alien look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
So, we haven't become more vulnerable to the alien look, for that same reason.
Let's also think about complication, cyberbullying, when these mothers...
They disseminate through social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what they used to be privately was to limit the group of acquaintances.
It is protected by the walls of the school or house, suddenly it exposes to millions of people, we all know.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, not much more serious, and we don't have where to take refuge.
(Laughter) Not within oneself, nor in intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping to an island of a certain way, that there are more and less or less exist, at least not without Wi-Fi, which is the theme.
So, it seems that this idea that hell is us.
It has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we may poster with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) If all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do? Also, this is better or worse than before, it's good, bad, how do we solve it?
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some peers of hunger, it seems that both blame and shame are social control mechanisms.
And the fact that guilt is losing most of its work now and that embarrassment is magnificating.
This is not good or animal in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind, it's a fact, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
The trend is what he wanted to tell, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) A few days ago we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
That we wouldn't forget these days.
And he let me tell us.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
Well, I dedicate myself to researching its education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I've come to think a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
And I would like to share three of those ideas that spinning around me.
In these days and that I hope, in one of those...
They serve us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, we all have the urgency of animals to test new ways of teaching.
Innovation and education is something close to what is being talked about.
But that until now they were happening isolately, separated.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and an obligation for emergency.
Those of us who dedicate ourselves to teaching are having to rediscover our classes at a distance.
And in this process, we visit each other to try new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
I had even had to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available.
In a period of time, emergency needs to be used.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms.
Social, media, so-called virus, whatever it gives us the results to keep teaching.
And especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
(Video ends) And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already starting to do your own.
They start to be part of what we know how to do, of our complaints of tools.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings, we have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to have patience, we do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
We are catching her a taste.
to test new ways of teaching and learning.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons.
Until fabrics workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as if, in these days, older people have started to show how to use the compound to make bank trucks for people of their age.
We're learning in community.
And the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school.
Just like what happened once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed -
I had a space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn.
And when and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
(Video ends) In these days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially when they are teenagers.
Some study more at night, others start with the subjects that interest you the most.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task, or changes on the web, to stop understanding something that doesn't come out to them, or to learn to the new ones who wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working the part.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
From very young, organizing their time.
Making the tasks and everything that requires learning to learn.
And my last reflection...
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as happens?
These days.
We don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
We realize, I don't know if these days are happening.
The difficult thing is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's never the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
He is the one who has a calm place to study and not.
And they have here to ask and not.
The one who has to be all the tasks of care in the house.
And the one that doesn't.
The school.
With all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
They are protected.
And focused on that.
And in full mother.
As an educator I'm very worried about how all this will follow and I also wonder what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is...
Did you see when you go to the tide and you stay the naked beach?
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes, also on the beach, seem to be some treasures hidden.
(Video ends) Women here even though, as my son said.
This historical moment is not for the good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relate to the use of time and we have to learn and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
Yes!
Physics are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building, among all of them, when all this happens.
It's an education we dream of.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and suddenly ...
We got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers in calcillation.
From his home.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up 7 toM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand the work of the Drail bulle.
That motoscorros learned to be cyber-attacks.
that mythomans and chisms gathered in the spread of conspirantolid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions before, peanphiles, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
I mean, all commercials worked for winter and I dreamed.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, we appreciated a button.
Just like the free one, or the free one didn't, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then we always earned most of a day for the other quickly.
In other words, without Northern administrators, or theoretical deputies, deciding instead of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also an online one.
Mines gave them the curas on YouTube, and of course it was forbidden to emigrate them to Youtube Kirds.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported the lawyers and the judges.
And that from one day to another, all those who had ever been rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
Through Google EAT.
And that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's business.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they had before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that united who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
So, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
I dreamed that we had to see TED talks from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the State would send us a 3D printer to each and buy imported products.
I dreamed that at night, in the big cities, the stars would meet again, shouting like in the field, and that in the field ...
They proliferated, all of a sudden, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very short communicator, the president told the people that it was possible to go out in the street.
That you could make a normal life, leave being the president, occupy your jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed July 9th.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked to the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We suffocated it.
And we killed it.
And that a sintriculing truck shocks against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out of their house, on the street, to take selfies with the dead avestruz and to steal wine.
And there were screams.
And soon someone pointed another and the journalists showed up again.
To transmit the live massacre and then over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
(Sigh) And I felt better.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Isn't it that when you see a picture?
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
(Applause)
That fact has always caught my attention because if you think that photogeneration is there.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So I already embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing.
No, and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
We have to look closely at the visible.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom: "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?"
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds.
(Laughter) Imagine my illusion when he accepted, I would eat the last or a sight with a cream that remained in life.
So I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
He wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until the Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
A lot of people back, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, singing the happy birthday, so I assumed it was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some benches of art and I said, "This girl likes art." Something that later I could confirm with some pictures she seemed painting.
(Laughter) All of that was going down and I discovered that who is one nowadays was his best friend.
(Laughter) She is a trans girl who inherited school last year and who is now studying graphic design.
And among all that, I could also see that it's a healthy person, that touches him and takes care of him, that is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds, my mom was unthinkable, I couldn't believe that I could know a person like this, through social networks.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To go from a general idea, that person, to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
And thanks to this, I can first get to know the person's details like their personality, their tastes, their family, their friends, and then make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern, and this is much more powered on social media.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to choose to show us their reality.
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helped me question myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like those that talked about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself: What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it?
And if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and I was eating very deserved, invites with a cream.
So we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and my day-to-day meetings is present.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
(Applause) I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask him to use on social networks, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Let's do it?
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
For two eyes.
In different parts of the face.
You will have stopped somewhere.
Effectively.
Some artists like Alberto Jaco Metti, or Leonardo da Vinci.
Did you know that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build?
The look of a portrait.
Also, the nazial buildings, the mouth's cracks, the limits of their ears.
The pores and details were fundamental elements to form what we would call.
The look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these people knew.
Which were the faces parts that the spectators searched?
And developing a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she's looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a popular positioning team in a neuroscience lab we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face?
To extract information, since the rest constitutes the brain.
If we put all the images, all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when we put together.
The portrait, and what is it not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how would it be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together?
The look of others.
What we built was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This tremendous rehearsal for the journey of an eye.
It's somehow a stranger.
Some of the projects carried together with Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Sounds, languages.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The abuse of pregnancy.
Two questions, the exploration, thank you very much. (Applause)
breast, breast, breast, well.
(Music) (Applause)
At the exact moment in which we are born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However?
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me, "What are you so young?"
It's my future that replied: "I want to live for many years and to that point I'm going, what I didn't say at that time."
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Meet to be old, no.
Lead to live in a society where the most important thing is to be.
Or seem young.
Fear?
To my knowledge and my experience lose value.
That my word...
It hasn't taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides, stereotypes linked to age are still socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities, in labor searchs...
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the male dive of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-beatable.
Does it mean that they can take care of themselves?
And to take care of others.
Or this shared belief that the elderly are sad or depressed?
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people of my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label?
The passive class: who exactly seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social behaviors and institutions.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is proved that the projects involving elderly people have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial purposes.
That includes it.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
(Applause)
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
That of the older person in a park, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images, words are missing.
older adults, third age.
Levely, elderly are the suits.
Gerant.
Ansians.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everyone.
The only one I suggest to avoid is a grandfather or a grandmother.
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But if it's affectionate.
You could say "my" because you're a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond.
older people have a name.
It's like everyone.
(Applause)
Stereotypes stimulate them.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we collapse, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, create employment, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However...
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why, my proposal is to listen and learn from older people to really understand their new needs.
Its new possibilities, desires, and tastes.
A while ago, interviewing an older person, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do activities with people of their age or with younger people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
(Music) (Applause)
