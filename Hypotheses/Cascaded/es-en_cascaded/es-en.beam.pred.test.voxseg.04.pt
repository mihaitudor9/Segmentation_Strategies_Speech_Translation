I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me with it.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
Or learn to feel, think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
Well, 30 meters below the water, with that feeling of ungravable, surrounded by a huge biodiversity, turtles, molamous fish, fish from all colors.
But I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
But it was a mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Are you scared?
And black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was an intense spiritual feeling, and you're thinking, "This teacher is crazy, spoke with fish," it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say, "Gee, the teacher is crazy."
A: But I'm not crazy.
(Laughter)
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
The work lasts 24 hours a week.
To draw that piece of art we're going to see.
Or on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that mandala that we see proves that nature has awareness and that I'm not crazy.
And if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
And I think so.
Last year, Science magazine published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern, reproduces our inner, in our organic physiology.
And according to Clayber's law.
It's an elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
DB: Yes, but three, four.
And if you stop to think about it?
The planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right?
So I ask myself: Is it a simple coincidence or nature really has an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great history of my doctoral research, that is, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
That is, the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of human beings.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development and here they bring you a summary.
I agree with scientific consensus.
The universe emerged 13.7 billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4,500 and 5 billion years.
And the miracle of life between 3800 and 3500 million years.
During the first half of this trunk, you have a wide range of multicellular organisms, like Pes, which are developing survival strategies, with the cosmic exclusion of fathers, the biological variety has increased very fast, by measuring a wide range of complex organs very simple, like, for example.
And although everything seems to indicate that life followed and the depths of the oceans, he couldn't reach the Earth, sign up until about 450 million years ago.
In fact, it is known that the autropitects have about 4 million years, the 2 million Hor√©ctus, the dental and homo sapis, 200,000 years ago, the hegemonic period began with mammals, thanks to the possible remains found until the year.
(Laughter) Currently, homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species that cohabits and co-evolves around the planet Earth, pointing to the rest of its rich biodiversity.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago, and especially since the industrial revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed.
It was like something unbearable.
It's a species between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, one single species, another one.
It is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy, and all of us are responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs, but the human being keeps trying to destroy everything around him.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And although it seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, to equate the thermal fusion of the stars, that can reach 65 million integrated degrees, and, if that were not the future generations, they are also threatened by the great ecological footprint we left in Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: From 1990 to 2020 we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Who is the world's forum of nature?
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like the New Year.
But we don't have four true planets, that's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater and we fire the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation, I give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not to read that competition, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life and cooperation.
football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players together with all the thermal body behind.
Our body is a pluricellular organism where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we are.
Paradoxically, but the human being continues to create linear thinking ideologies, is the best way to imitate it and perfect it to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered meteorites and linear disasters.
Doctrina is political, like anarchism that failed communism, which failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has failed, it has more money than the rest of 99 percent.
And that is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren, that don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that is co-patted, because it advances nature to get nuclear benefits at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life, and that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
This is not new, it's already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, from thousands of years ago, and it's something that's inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you to play a game.
A: discrimination.
What happens to them with this window? How could engineers, architects, economists, be inspired? Well, they thought of making a plane?
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
Well, the Japanese made the Bach train.
And with this bat?
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
Or we could build bioclimatic buildings.
And with this turning on its own.
A plant of solar panels, as we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature will be there forever, and we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP. What does it mean?
And climbing a bit by economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
Well, for the industry.
We must be aware that the world we live in is not a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has started?
Can you imagine?
A future dialogue with her children and grandchildren, I would like her to tell me, "Dad, at least you tried it, fight."
And you?
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
And what we have to say is that the fourth of our opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's horrible things, we're going to do everything we lack, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, we spend it badly, socially for friends.
This horrible thing, there's nothing to do the perfect, and there's no reason to think that it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of and we're leaving something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment, said that, we'll be now.
And I think I'm not only bringing it.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
And what impresses me is that he will take care of a garden, and then he decides when he was diagnosed with H.V, to return to his childhood passion to kindergarten, three men of a man who, in fact, after his diagnosis, are a lot of very important movies, some important spaces of his career, but what he decides is going to those who will buy a land in a place in a horrible spirit, as a person, as a person, writes.
It wasn't, well, spending the time, taking care of a garden was not time, not like now that we spend the time cooking or breading.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And this reproductive work reproduces the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, cook, copy, take care, and then think of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes at maximum, from Fred and Gengers, basically, and that later takes a long time.
Suming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we carry on is that reproductive work has economic value, because instead of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value.
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an artist, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't make you an important person, it doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you origin, it's important, these are the producers to disenalize the speakers and the reproductive, why store it?
Let's think it's the opposite, it even says care tasks, are the most important ones, if today we are living without advertisers, without writers?
Seriously, a lot of things, even moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps moving, but the world doesn't send itself spinning without food and care.
And without health, the only thing that is allowed us today is to eat and cure and clean.
What if it isn't a magical world, then?
These tasks are not a mechanical thing that we have to go above, that hopefully they didn't exist, maybe you could do this, clean the almost, not only that is absolute, but cooking, not only we can think like that, we have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans is that we also deposit them to live them differently, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom, as tasks in which as well.
The relation of care with our bodies, we think that we have to take care of our bodies is also something interesting, we are involved as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that also has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modern nature, modernity, not just the things that matter.
Right?
But that is also a very strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, it can't be that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do something that has to overlook.
Well, this is not an opportunity.
And in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life, we all live in this contradiction and this life for the absurd, now.
(Laughter) Since the world needs more soap operas, I thought, "Well."
Why not connect with the world, with the body, with care, with others, and with doing all the school and all that, why not think about connecting with others in a different way from that?
That's why, when I was invited to do this hall that I didn't, because I thought I didn't want to have an original idea, the world hadn't been that the soap opera and that the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought, actually, we're going to write, bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I had with my books and that I wanted to tell other people, more than do, take care of it.
G.G.
PK: When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
No more bread, no more sweet, no more posters.
Hasado, past, every 15 days, an end of a half.
What wakes up is the overwhelmed and disordened way in which we consume them, that's why I want to name you three key aspects to have a good food: the first is consciousness.
AC: One time, a teacher told me: "Onstage of secondary awareness to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take awareness is high to our desires...
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat, but the opposite, the one we liked the most.
And after that, we are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating and what amount.
QD: A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, there is no hunger in the smooth.
And that hunger is hunger, hungry, and the warmer.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
B, dream, hug, an escape with double cheese.
So?
Going back to the subject.
We are really able to say pizza, nothing funny, I prefer a needle.
Impossible, huh?
The second aspect is practice.
To eat, like every process in life, you learn.
And in this case, and in many cases, my include remains.
We must learn to eat in this station what this means, to eat the food that was costed at that time.
And this allows us to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and to enhance our health.
A: Because foods were expelled properly from its time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients, that is, they are not addressed with calories, that is, they are not solely addressed to subsist in time, or it's normal to see fruit all year, unnecessary for our body, and they are not treated chemically to subsist in time, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony to eat always the same.
The last aspect?
That for me it's not a small one, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
Those who don't break, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because they often give Ausia.
And I have a question.
But they also give them Ausias.
Let's repeat the match plate with fruit?
To think, right?
PK: So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
Because hunger is not affordable if they stay comed, if they eat.
And what wasn't consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night, and in double split.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
increasingly bigger, increasingly increasingly increasingly stronger.
So, if we don't stop every three or four hours.
Well, to take a break.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unfold the false belief, that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the smaller I will be, the more weight I'll lose, and no.
The most expert body becomes in reserve, in storing.
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, all we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat, we go out in favor of that ignorance, food can hurt you or can cure you, depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding and in which amount.
So, I return to the moderation.
Just as there is the phrase that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation.
That such food stimulates overweight.
To give a closure?
I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like, eat various, but always take care of the portion.
(Pre-recorded voice) There's no reason the phrase of "Sayuna como rey," "For√ßa como prince and dinner as a begging."
I think many people know it.
health doesn't have excuses: "I can't, there I don't have one, hunger happened, or worse."
Sometimes I died of breastfeeding.
We have four opportunities every day.
To choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthily.
Thank you very much.
A while ago I was obsessed with telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first one that happened obvious to me, Marie Curie, they didn't give them a Nobel Prize, they were given two.
So it deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things.
Recently, I learned about Eugenia's story to be a dote.
Eugenia was a Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War and made great contributions.
Among them, the most important one was the one who brought the vaccine "salk against polio" in the 50s, thanks to her, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less from 2002 that I work at university doing research.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And do you know what they died in 2011 was 111 years old?
But I found out of them recently.
How I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that gave me to find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were, but above all, to not lose ourselves at the age.
(Video ends) We lost a lot of time at school learning ortography.
The kids?
They keep losing a lot of time at school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question nor the answer are new in our language, is reboating from the century to the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography a very clear and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound had to correspond to one letter, each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography as a cat, which sometimes are aspers as people, in Latin, Greek, and so we stay with feces, feces and feces.
Three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
QD: I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience, we all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that time of plastic, child, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules, crying, however, exceptions, they broadcast us in many forms and explained the idea that in ortography there was something fundamental for our training.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, even if they asked a previous question: What was the function that complied ortography?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is quite simpler and less transcendental of what you usually believe, ortography is useful to uniform writing, so that everyone writes the same way and so it is not easier to understand ourselves when we read, but in contrast with other aspects of language, like puntuation itself.
And with puntuation, I can choose to change the meaning of a phrase with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing, with ortography, no, with ortography or it's OK, as it is fair or not just the current rules, but then it wouldn't be easier to teach, learn and use correctly ortography.
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
So that all that time we dedicate to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, do deserve time and effort.
(Video) What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not like that.
In other words, that each one writes however they want.
Sign language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental.
That those common criteria are the simplest possible.
Especially.
Because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling downward, when ortography simplifies, it doesn't feel at all.
It was the quality of language.
Chorus.
I work every day with literature to say it from Olo Lego, Agarcilazo, Aservantes, Agongora, what do I see?
That sometimes they write men, without H. Sometimes they write "scribing with scholarship" and it's absolutely clear to me that the difference between these texts and ours.
It's of convention or lack of convention still at the time, but not of quality.
But let me go back to the teachers, because they are personal.
What's key in this story?
I mentioned that insistence a bit irreflexive.
The teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the blame of broken, the educator of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is being written, we can be able or stop finding a job by a H, which put or stopped putting.
You can become an object of public mockery for once misplaced.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers.
Or individuals related to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was an obstacle for transmitting knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andr√©s Bello, promoted the highest ortographic reform that could indeed take place.
It was in the Spanish language, the one in Chile, in the middle.
In the 19th century.
Why not take the bet of those teachers?
And start.
I'm going to move forward in our ortography here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
We chose HMUDA, where we wrote a H.
(Laughter) But we don't say anything, we don't write anything, it's hard to think which kind of sentimental attachment can justify for someone.
All the troubles H-Muda causes us: Velarga and B-Cort, we said before, they never recognized in Spanish language, we chose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one can argue, we want no one, eliminate the other, ghe and the gauta retains the sound "asper√≥."
Garave, giraffe, people.
It's Argentinian.
And I know!
Because that, Iceta, is an interesting case.
Because it shows that phonetic criteria should be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncy must be taken, now I said before, that are feces in some places correspond to a sound in two and three letters, we go down to two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic.
Well, they are not that much.
The Spanish Academy Real, all language gyms, also believe that ortography should be modified, that sometimes this attachment to history, traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle for today's use.
That explains, in fact.
I think our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically close.
How was it historically modified, for example?
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater, to theater, we were of quantity, we were of symbol, of symbol.
And little by little, some roads start to be removed in the dictionary of the Academia Real Academia, flour, harmony can be written with H or H.
And we're all fine.
And it also seems to me.
Well, this is a moment.
I particularly appropriated to confront this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
That are users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is an academic, in other places a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
So, a long time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the language level, it's less true.
(Laughter) For the grammar level, and I almost would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above to below.
There were always the institutions that focused on the norms.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until now, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use than speaking?
But at our time, the time of social media, that is suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now, never so many wrote in the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale dusted ortographic shapes, where even people with impeccable orthography and pereducated people when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
And, for now, there.
There are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention to it.
Because they are probably telling us that a time that is assigned to writing, a new place.
And I'm asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we'd do it wrong.
And also to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, no, I think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them.
In other words, within a standard more at all with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with simplified ortography.
Let's recover etymology at the same place where we go now, to etymological dictatorships, a second served objection of those who say.
If we simplify spelling, we'll stop distinguising the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring.
In the vast majority of situations, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
And for me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, which is what they say.
And I don't want to change.
I get hurt like this, I got used to this way when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "The eyes hurt me."
(Video) That objection is part of each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used to?
And it is expected that time feels.
That are the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits.
The consensus is in favor, the level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us.
And I'm convinced that if we do that...
And in the modest field.
But importantly, in language, we will be letting them go to the next generations.
I made a future.
It wasn't better.
Good afternoon before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris.
(Laughter) And tell me, don't hang your eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense, he had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry.
And I felt the need to look at their ashes at the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
(Laughter) The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became a father.
This image.
Well, you see it.
And that's the image of the ashes of my father in a microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this taught me that our most pure material essence is acariciated by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror there is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
Thank you!
In Argentina, INBAP.
This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
Third: And space technology.
Because their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
AC: We shouldn't create an INBAP for education.
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
The work with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with teachers, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
Why should this be blind of short-term political logic?
They should come to the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management.
And the first step.
And it's thinking of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
That's how education changes won't benefit the most advantages.
(Applause) Today, I'm not scientist, and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
extraterrestrial inventions, from great shapes, even pandemics.
And here and now, at home, until fiction became real realities, we don't stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition, even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
Well, for example, worldwide obsession could buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior, which seems and ridiculous, has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on the intensity than on the relevance, the answer is a bit like the footballer who runs desperately a ball that actually knows won't happen.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease but had sequenced its genome and had done it publicly.
Thinking that in reality we're not going to do for another principle of human psychology. The same here makes many of us drive or drive while talking on the phone or worse, while we send messages, called "the optimistic seed", is it that each time it's not going to happen?
And it made the great politicians of Europe and many tropicators in the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but more moral or social, why do this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unfortunate or stigmas, for example, in the bobonic fishing, they refused to Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, with the United States.
But when actually this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick contagiate others. However, in Japan, everyone is willing to massage.
This first makes people sick and not contagiate and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you only use more caregivers, you know who's sick and who isn't for if you wear or not more affection.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the stest and take care of everybody.
Maybe, what we've discovered beyond our traditions, our habits, our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we really lack is motivation to do something, and yet, in three days, now all children are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this, but we learned that we are willing to make the premature need and the world does change.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to do a small mental experiment, a dilemma, a caricature so we can think about the future?
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of the pandemic, a public council that includes the World Health Organization, but also to govern ourselves and other public sectors has the capacity through some technology, to know where we were, where we found, and also the data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our fold load, and can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of infecting and who is not.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of epidemic, and we keep in this mental experiment, let's know even more yet that this council can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way, it can go out, it doesn't disappear completely, but it dies much less people to stop the economy and the world in the way we see it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that it was a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the principle of the pandemic and could choose if you feel good or bad to do this?
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's a voice to the inevitable attention there is, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
Perhaps, screwing our data is a bit like vaccinating, it's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms, as part of a social pact, to take care of us.
And everything.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case with sexual freedom, we find a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
Great!
When all this happens, what is the balance we want to get to feel free and careful at the same time?
Are they going to fly less environments in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves? Do we think it's good to be part of our tattoo as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want anybody to be the conservative sex of coronavir.
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, in Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with strings full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It was an animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples," are part of the sea's wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment, I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile.
The sea dollar was broken, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way, but I was interested in fossils, or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating and taking me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very well known, domated by dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
It's a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
Why?
10,000 for 10,000, these are 100 million, it's a quantity that doesn't fit into the amount.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
BB: In our heads.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
Have you traveled?
Well, successes and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to figure out how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, South of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it also took me.
to a very special place.
Well, what is Patagon?
And when we say "patagonia."
We naturally think of these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists.
No, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
This is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common meatm belonged to a family called Velis√°urios, while for that time, in the northern hemisphere, other families of carnivores were planted, like the tyrannosaurus, where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in jurassic, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of the dinosaurs on our planet, for the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivores of carnivores in all the planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagonia.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking a very hot afternoon.
And after walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached, it became clearly what it was.
It was the path where it hurt us.
I approached, stood next to me, shooled, I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and at the Bellos knew it was, after studying years, bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the tracket of a carnivor dinosaur was.
But I couldn't believe it, I already knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
After warning the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
And until the next season the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found, or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day of the stadium.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was something weird.
Clearly, the animal was dead in the beaches of a lake and it was covered by fine layers of mud, preserving in a spectacular way in life position, in the waves of dinosaurs, a complete skeleton, preserved in an intact way its time it read.
And that's where the excavation really begins, to throw away, layer, those sediments that were burning us where it would be, it's a very exciting moment, for the first time it's going back to the surface a animal that lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The cinema had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Afterwards, all that buried rocket had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a warming of this whole block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosion.
These layers, layer, layer, until you start discovering.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking from those hills looking for.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering the judges is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The patagonic wind, which doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry all this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the museum lab, another extremely long stage starts, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur, those carnivores of the South Hemisphere, and this discovery showed us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
From what we thought.
Much before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate themselves, being due to a big ocean, the time of fire, when all continents were united in a supercontinent supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transported to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside us and after nine months of work in the lab we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was contained in those wheelchairs.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange accidents, dents in form of hand, and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
For this dinosaur is also very special.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replica of this dinosaur, is a very, very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 centimeters from the end of the head at the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur minister didn't look at the forms we contracted or knew from the northern hemisphere, studying its remains, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times, and this was not so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other in this period of panaga, the Atlantic ocean was still not formed today to these two continents, but, again, we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Returning the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic, that was possibly present in the existence of a certain fact in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was in the south of this huge equatorial desert, it was a great fact what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the fauna of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these vaccines, it wasn't a desert filled with water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs.
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really find fantastic, fascinating organisms, have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this is the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written over 4500 million years.
(Video ends) And life.
I hear a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages still to read this book.
And if we really want to know our planet, its poems, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays, it's crucial to know its history.
Because knowing the past is key to understand the present.
Audience: Yes!
But it's also key.
To project a future.
Many of us.
Or when I was a kid I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dreamed of healing and having magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
Later, time gives us a reality bathroom.
You lost the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
You see empires implant small villages and try to understand how these superpowers work, but something of that childhood vocation remained in me, and almost without realizing all my life, I dedicated myself to looking and you don't have the position of patterns to defend them, it's not my imagination but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers, maybe, which is the superpower to think better.
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you about, that we are able to learn and that our ability to think is not given nor fixed, but can be developed.
Pooling our mind with powerful and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look at those on the floor, fathers of these brickets, fixed bikes, they turn around.
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same, it doesn't count to think, or what counts is to think.
We have to practice thinking, developing in ourselves the habit of thinking and give time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have, it's something you use or you don't use.
It's the second.
I said the saying that just seeing a bottle, that now the one with only a bottle sees all the problems as a slave.
But if we have to remove a torn, a hammer is useless.
And not to take into account of his slave.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a brain.
To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems, if we only have a mental model, we will think all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 off with a knife.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where we take them out, but where they are in different disciplines, in different places and different times?
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, mental psychology, and there are also different models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
There are mental models in the old Egypt three,000 years ago before Christ, in the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better we have to broaden the brand of tools of our head, but all the problems will seem worried to us.
It's the third one.
Not long ago, I was at the club and at the table on the side, a man told his friends, after his son and his classmates, who had told him about his son's soccer teacher for a mistake that teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told the teacher.
But it didn't realize.
(Laughter) Why?
Or by saying this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In his child.
I was leaving him like a bone in front of his friends and he was detegitiming the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn.
But many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning on a scale.
It makes us succeed in that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion and lose friendship, for example, winning money and losing freedom, or winning freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about the most important scale what we are going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
And the beginning taught us that the essentials invisible the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, now in the pandemic, many data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions and they didn't make us act.
When they began to come images of Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those pressions generate emotion, fear, and fear generates action, that we are all stored preventively what is very good.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone like us happened before.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Caster is one thing: you're hungry, you're married."
You have an immediate reward of eating what to get married.
But very different farms do the effort now for something you're going to be able to fire within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
Prevention creates applause because it is avoiding something that no one is delicious, but saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel, that is, develop our ability to anticipate, is one of the main skills of thinking well.
Well, let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we don't see?
Of whom?
But we all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted, if we programmed to run 20 to 9 we are impecable.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
But the sixth is last.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of the boat, a high school classmate that you wouldn't do 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague in that place is something totally unlikely, but, as we know so many people, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same, there are so many unbelievable things that are very likely that something happens to us.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future, we don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times, we have to learn to coexist with uncertainty.
Maybe the intelligent way of coexisting with uncertainty is to always leave many open doors.
Not to think just about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible to serious things, even if it's very likely.
And if someone ever asks you, why do you always have a car with Nasta tank full?
It's not that because once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world with a high schoolmate you didn't see 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking and people with whom we cultivate these ideas, empower ourselves from people who enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others, it's about changing our own ideas.
Why?
In a Borques interview 40 years ago, the interview asked me a question, and when Borges replied.
The interviewee told me, "That's what you answered to me."
And this same question four years ago.
Borphy, do you want Caixado?
He looked at him and said: "I apologize, it hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limited moment that is to live to be accepted of the new ideas that are emerging and always open to change our way of thinking.
Women are irraational beings always given to emotional disorder, that's why they need the cost of a man, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives.
They will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915, no country in the world women could vote, in 2015, so, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of us here had already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, a woman is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
Well, this was this idea.
that women are only useful to create children and help their husband.
It's an irraational being, a cisteric being.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed in it, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time, and almost all taking 5,000, perhaps, believed that this idea was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived through are economic, there are the facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem: now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
So, what is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we've convinced it's on September 24th, because all we're here agreed with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreu, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more they exist.
And on September 24th, nothing would make sense. Every thing we say, every thing we think, every goal we put is part of a very hard social construction that we have automated and naturalized, cats live without a calendar.
My dog appreciates the hot and the one at this moment is alone at home.
No, causing some illness.
And I didn't know the time, I knew it, what time had I come back.
But he doesn't look at the clock.
But if human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, he looked at a pity fall, was to write the law of gravity, what a genius, but it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels had passed away, to know the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc., besides...
To discover the investigations that were accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, or it has never been, but if it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now, and the same, political and social change, revolutionary change, as we have seen, for thousands of years, women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless, in less than 100 years, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women. They look at all the creative energy lost by humanity to think how women were not for anything else than to clean pneakers.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that model to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality, until 1860 there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say: "But how in the Greeks and the Romans, and the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you today, they've always existed in all culture, they're at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human, but they had never thought that sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Vitoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger and that exists, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbs.
(Laughter) You'll do it guilty, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to be guilty.
(Laughter) The guilt is a huge social control.
(Applause) Yes?
(Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, do you do it, right?
And then, that is a terrible social control form because it dominates us.
(Laughter) Probably, on one hand, you know we can't leave, it's as if they deprived us of eating.
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world.
They didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to stand up, the same as women before, or the Jews or the blacks, who would be left from slavery, we didn't even speak when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of sexual friends, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the Jews' situation, in some of the situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
And 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood. This has just been up now, in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
They were not being fusiled.
But in many parts of the world today they are completely legal. This was possible, for the change of paradigm, and why this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed people, accept their identity, make them respect, and then make others understand that they are also human beings that have a full right.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jew, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, complex, contradictory, that maybe I don't want to cost a guy, what do I know, but however, I have to assume that?
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
What 50 years ago?
Look how old sun is.
I was a homosexual boy, I didn't know what it was to make a homosexual boy, and they didn't even say to me like this: "My schoolmate told me, "Sure, we're going to hit you."
"Sure, don't look at me."
I didn't even know what it was to be a cake, a dumb, a homosexual, or anything, and at the same time I knew that it was rejection, that was something I had in me, that I didn't know that my father, who loved me, looked at me.
And it made me feel what I would have done so bad for it to come out like this.
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
But it had a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn that I'm also good to someone, to say that I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that I have to escape identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had been having.
It's something that arises from understanding that there are no facts that exist.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
(Laughter) interpretations.
(Applause) There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it, we're contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to take the assume to stay there to defend myself, and now I want to leave prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison it is?
Good evening!
Oh, or they told me that there is a list of things we need to survive, called "the basic canot," which is the idea of constantly living with this rough, the one of Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
But it contains the things we need to survive, and if better there were the things we need to explore, but exploring is something difficult, terrifying, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement brings us extraordinary situations.
Adaptary is a long or small moment full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
When everything I did is erased by someone else's voices, you, I'm not even in a microphone, that splits the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, but once you say it, once you can take your words, you take an avalanche and ideas that come to you at all speed.
Every moment is a combination of energy that seeks to exterminate, each one of these ideas looks like a bomb, that seeks to exterminate, but some of these ideas are rain, and you are able to choose, to see your paraglements and cover them, or to do one side and in part with each one of them, to keep returning, jumping, or running.
(Laughter) But learning to do this movement is complicated, learning to damage your own movement, a class is not quite bad, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment and that, even if life controls music, the movements created them.
Designs that take us to moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments that are kept in words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that will probably not be an artwork, but will allow you to revive the exact way in which those stars were seen.
That voice, your best friend, will always be there, will be the first to defend yourself, the first to give yourself a little bit of chance to jump that sea, and at the same time the first one is in that shore, that person is a better friend.
A microphone, a couple ofaguas, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, if it's not a moviemaker, I can't survive.
What we grew up in girls cities.
I'm sure that we once chose.
(Laughter) There's no opportunity to get out, there's nothing to do, I can't go on a stable job, I can't make any progress in the way I would like to.
It's me.
(Laughter) Do you remember that all the past was better?
Is this really the case?
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
When I thought about this, it was in 2009 when I had to go to high school, and Juancho, Franco and Manuel, in these photos you're seeing there, inevitably, I remember my friends of the whole life.
What can I say to my friends that I really love them, that they are like my brothers and they are three super capable that, as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to study what they liked, they stayed here in the city?
And be sure, until today, they can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
As for me, as I am the port in this photo, the mark of the absence of opportunities also became present, my folks, who are workers, made an effort on human beings so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that my fears knew that if they stayed here in the city...
I could study others, but probably the future as a person was so short of opportunities.
Well, maybe some of you wondered why are these things happening?
And we live in the middle of the 21st century, we are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress are at a speed that all surprise us and collapse the borders and barriers that insist on people.
And in this context?
And the cities to make more and more important tales, we go to the sincere, they are our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that, in 2050, 68% of the world population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more and more people choose to live in cities it means there are places where we have more chances to progress.
What is the reason why, while weapons cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everybody wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them?
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that they want them to cheat the cow when they come out from that door to return to their homes: this one, strategy.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
Part of my concern, as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely by this, by connecting the cities and trying to decrease the impact the world can have about our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) Now you may ask me: How do you see all this beautiful thing I'm telling you in real life?
Through the concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population, prevent migration towards other places in search of a better future.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, from which one is, we add a fifth friend, friend, female the group, and so avoids can be noticed a couple of things, first, drinks are something like that.
(Laughter) Secondly, as to say it's given a sort of proportional investment relationship, some have a couple of tips, as they improve the quality of the photos of the phones, those we were in it, we will improve, the brands of the false opportunities.
Franco, for example, who is also right in this photo.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2012.
He was a national champion.
(Laughter) But today, even if you want to detect a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday students working to be able to live.
(Laughter) Then you get somewhat, believe the one on my left, the strongest, that just then was his birthday.
(Laughter) When I wanted to study something related to the field of passion, and I cannot do a job that allows a certain economic independence.
(Laughter) But in account, all day working in his place that built from nothing itself.
He goes to university to study programming and cannot develop his potential and keep learning what he likes, because they can't capture necessary tools for the lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
It's that we, as young people, have nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, is that we have absolutely nothing.
Right?
Recently, I had the huge fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 youngedes at the world. I left Argentina representation. I was the only Argentinian who attended that event to participate in a week in New Delhi, the capital of India.
The thing is to say it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot, but if there are two things I'd like to share with you, they are accidents.
First, there are millions of opportunities out there, but there are millions of opportunities for all tastes and colors.
But we have to be speeches to find them, they don't come alone.
But not less important, do you know what differentiates them that we don't have, that have a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities so they can develop themselves?
(Laughter) Once we give better cities, we know strategically the world.
I don't remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I met to go to study, with three days to turn 18, I was scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be said in public because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city, your home, it's like leaving a piece of your heart, until today I feel it like this, almost six years went by.
(Laughter) Is everything going to be something with friends, parachute?
Neither anyone you know, it's necessary to provide the tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
After all, what's most beautiful to be allies to the city that had made you?
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco.
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or how much if today they were in one of the safety forces of our country?
Or to not go so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to keep adding what he likes.
That's it?
Thank you!
That's how we see the lack of opportunities.
Of course, all this.
What am I telling you?
It doesn't seem enough argument and they want another example.
Look!
That's fine.
DB: This is it!
That tattoo that tells me, when finally I was able to overcome the unique depression in which I fell for having to go to the edition.
After two intentions of suicide.
(Laughter) Sumerable, psychological sequels.
And it was hard for me!
Many, many well-known people.
If we want these things to stop happening, we have to go out strategically.
Please, we don't eat a final point in our city.
Great!
I'm a surgeon.
Well, since always the surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in the last 10 years.
It was my research.
(Laughter) In my case, in the sofa, it was based on looking for the reasons to operate less and less patients.
And that can be done in many ways, we do that, for example, by looking for genes to detect diseases sooner like cancer, and so we don't have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair by themselves.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
We do it with biological platforms, which are like maps we give to the tissue to use their own ability to restore themselves after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate this task.
(Laughter) What seemed like science fiction previously, today is almost everyday, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction, to me.
And a lot of patients that prevented having to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work.
I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor, my mother is Japanese, and in addition to my work of many years I've had contact with literary, sociological and anthropological questions of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's about making us a first question.
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium?
And if it was in January, the first case happened.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
Moving from the population of the third age in the world.
Singing in the second country with more smokers for a number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear advance and identified one.
GB: Until now.
We know that this new virus runs a very contagious, in these demographic data, so Japan shows us a cater that would enable us to spread the disease.
Basically, many people in little place and a quarter of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in a way that responds organically and united to any event that compromises it.
Japan went through war.
Picks, their name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 earthquakes per day.
Generation, after generation, has had to overlleve natural disasters contained by humans.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained, who has no infrastructure, who has to go out to improvise.
The directives of social distancing and hygiene and individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or in its own home.
The Japanese population has established it hundreds of years ago, it's not necessary to say no to embrace, not to give them bees, because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most of the workers in public spaces use singers.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50 percent of Japanese don't have to indicate not to sweat or possess any other person, because this is a habitual protocol among Japanese, they will use Barbijo when they feel rewarded.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
Audience: Yes.
The good of all is more important than the good of a part.
Yes!
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They did two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
And you will surely know the game of the chair.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get one out of each round.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, kept all following the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves this way of being, it's about having confidence that the other person will take care of me.
In resonance, allow us to perform when we take care of others.
There's a child in the example.
But we can already see how a collective society works.
(Laughter) They help themselves, because every IBism contributes to the good of everyone.
