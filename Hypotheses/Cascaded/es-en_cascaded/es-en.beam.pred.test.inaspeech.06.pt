(Laughter) I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
And I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
Do we need it?
Learn to feel.
Think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the star of the Hamboque, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water, with that feeling of pregnancy, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, turtles, molamous fish.
And from fish from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Do you have gangs?
Neg and yellows, it came out of a fish bank.
It was put in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
I know what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he speaks to fish, right?
It's the same thing my students think at university, every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
Why?
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
And he works 24 hours for a week.
To draw.
AC: That work of art we're going to see.
Or, on the contrary, the maritime current would take it, that sentence we see proves that nature has awareness and that I'm not crazy, and if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants?
With rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific proofs.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems analyzed.
Scientists.
They said there is a mathematical pattern of 3/4 between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern.
It is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
Do you remember Cleber's law?
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
The planet we live in.
It is composed of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
Or nature really has an inherent consciousness.
After thousands and thousands of years of intersisted co-evolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say.
All those sciences.
What do uniforms integrate?
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should mimic and perfect.
To achieve a sustainable development and here I bring you a summary.
And I remember with scientific consensus, with the explosion of primogenite life on Earth, they maintained in very simple levels of complexity, with the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere, the first complex cells that have been originated by developing survival strategies, with the cosmic exclusion of hatred, the biological variety has increased to a large speed of this period.
Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that Cocoa has about 4 million years, if it seems to indicate that the agricultural revolution, domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a transcendental way, as something unsustainable.
Three times.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species?
A single species?
Nita, isn't it?
It is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of species.
And that is to be there.
All of us are responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
Although it seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
Why do you have an idea?
Following the thermal fusion of the stars, which can reach 65 million °C.
And if that was little.
The future generations.
Is it good they are threatened?
By the great ecological fingerprint we left in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020, we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Secondly, the world's forum of nature.
If all of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitate the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of GDP.
fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, have generated a huge global warming.
What does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are letting our children and our children.
A scenario of cronic shortage of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignity.
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
Let me give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Curring, fighting, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not to read that competition, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes contracts.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the technical body behind them.
Is it our body?
Is it a pluricular organism?
Where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are.
Paradogically, nature is the best way of imitating it and perfecting to achieve sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time.
Has he suffered disasters?
glaciation, meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
But human beings continue to create linear thinking ideologies.
Toctrine is political, like anarchism.
who failed communism, who failed socialism, failed.
capitalism has failed too.
An study from Oxford last year said that 1 percent of the richest people in our planet.
It has more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick patologically and that if it's charged, because nature advances to obtain economic benefit, we've sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn.
To feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
Right?
My life, my great imitation, my life imitation.
But this is not new, it's already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you.
Make a game.
From imagination?
What happens to this wire?
How could engineers, architects do?
The economists, let's be inspired.
Well, they had the idea of doing it.
A plane.
What would happen to their peak?
From the birds, Martín Bolador.
The Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
With this golden wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
With this circle alone.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bio-spiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature ...
It will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase.
of GDP.
What does PIB mean?
Many economists tell us we have to manufacture, to build.
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We have to be aware.
since the world we live in.
It's not a gift of our parents, but a loans of our children and our children.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
A future in dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me.
At least you tried it, you fought.
And you.
What would you like to do?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What we have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's horrible things, we won't do everything missing.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically.
A friend Mentole.
We feel bad, socially with good, we fool ourselves to our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do with the appearance, and not about why you think it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of it and that we're not leaving of something if we don't take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Have you done that?
Life is not about something else, that goes through horrible moments and they learn from them: we learn pain, illness.
Demoder to error, doesn't die death.
We've always done it and we're going to happen.
That's not going to be now.
And what I didn't have, thinking about André.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, that cinema is right to build.
They are the newspapers that have already taken in the USA.
When they diagnose it, do they chew?
And then he decides to return to his passion childhood to kindergarten, but that's not a filmmaker, which, in fact, I'm going to diagnose later.
They are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the most important ones in their career.
But what he decides is that he will buy a ground in mourning, right? A horrible thing.
And he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
As a person writes.
For him, taking care of a kindergarten was not having time.
It wasn't, well.
The time went by.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking, making bread or whatever I know.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And I thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From Friy Gengers, basically.
And that later I took particularly the feminist morsimo.
To talk about reproductive work, not even the productive work that makes new things in the world?
We can say, I mean, always my father or a slap, it doesn't matter.
And this is a reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that: clean, cook, care, right?
It happens to you.
So cooking the workers so that the next day they put the factory, that's the productive work.
And feminist for a long time now.
Aluming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we carry on is that reproductive work has economic value, because it's useful to make productive work, because workers don't eat in the factory.
Now, why is the edge of preserving in that relative value first of all we don't think of an absolute value?
Moreover, why don't we do as an insult and think that this difference is contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more inflictive difference given by one side.
Of course, gender, because of the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are the productive, traditionally performed by golders.
And reproductive ones.
It brings it if you don't interview it because women are important.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that's worth is the subject that the original makes, the world in which the subject lies you.
No, take care of?
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it doesn't make you an artist.
It doesn't make you kid, it doesn't make you a person matters.
These are well-known values, we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We're living without wrists, without writer.
Seriously, a lot of things were moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps moving.
But the world kept spinning without food.
And without care.
And without a disease?
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
How wrong?
What clean?
And without that, the world doesn't act.
Go!
Is it your tasks?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, right?
They are not mechanical that we necessarily have to go up, that I hope there wouldn't exist, that I hope you could do this, clean the almost, cook, or solve food.
It can't, we can think like that.
We have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans.
Just by peoples also living them differently.
Are we going to live them?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modern nature, modernity, not like...
The separate human being.
The natural world?
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
The care relationship with our bodies, we think there's someone to take care of the body.
No, here on stage you have to...
Coffinada.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
She looked at me.
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
I think...
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
We all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now!
Of course, the world needs more soap operas.
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
Instead of being obsessed with being productive these days.
And knowing all the holes and all that, why not think?
They have to connect with the world, with the body, with care, with the others, in a different way from that.
That's why, when I was invited to do this passive thing, because I thought I didn't want to have an original idea, the world hadn't been so novel so that the world doesn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what was already there.
Be careful that I...
I had my books and that might help other people, right?
More than writing it down.
What else to do?
Thank you very much.
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
No more bread.
Other times, Damas Potress.
It's enough every 15 days to be scared.
An end of a half.
These foods don't get fat.
What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them, but today I want to name them.
Three key aspects.
To have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
One time, a teacher told me, "Canning awareness is secondary to brain activity."
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject.
I'm talking about our subconscious.
Our desires, our beliefs.
So, is it taking secondary awareness to our desires?
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one who doesn't like the most.
And after that?
We are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating.
Who, how many?
QD: A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, we are not hungry.
That blood of all, it's hungry, it's the warmer.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
It's always forbidden.
It has been the most tempting, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pixes.
"Be, dream, hug, a burrow with twice?"
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
That is, pizza.
Thank you, I prefer a water aguardolf.
Impossible, right?
But the second aspect is practice.
Do we eat it?
Like every process in life, you learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
That my include represents itself.
But we must learn to eat in this station.
What does this mean?
That is to say, eating foods that were costed at that time.
This is going to guarantee a control and an equilibrium in our weight and put a god in our health.
A: Because foods surrounded by their own times.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients and they are not treated chemically to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or it's normal to see fruit all year long, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee us a quality and variety consumption.
Where we are not going to fall in the monotony of eating always the same.
The last aspect?
That for me it's not a small one, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
Those who don't break, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because they often give them usories.
And I have a question.
OK?
Are they scared?
Repeting the mattress dish with cold?
To think, right?
So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
Because hunger is not variable.
Yes, they restring foods, if they get out of eating, what is not consumed in the day is going to consume in the afternoon or at night and in double division.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volume.
And increasingly with more strength.
So, if we don't stop, each three.
Four hours.
To take a swing.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
Audience: Yes!
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unfold the false belief, that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the smaller, I'll be, the more weight I'll lose and not.
The most expert body becomes in reserve, in storing.
And when I'm talking about reserving, I mean this, all we want to eliminate from our body.
Why?
Food doesn't only make you fat.
We go out for this ignorance, food can hurt you or can cure you, depend on us, take awareness, what we are feeding us and what amount.
I mean, I return to the moderation.
Just as there is the phrase that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation.
There's food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure.
I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like.
To eat various, but always take care of the portion.
There's no reason that "Sayuna como rey" quote as a prince and dinner as a beggar.
I think many people know it.
(Laughter) health has excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have it there."
I was hungry or worse.
And sometimes I died of hunger.
We have four opportunities every day.
And to choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthily.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Some time ago I've been obsessed telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first one that was obvious to me.
Marie Curie.
When they were given a Nobel Prize they gave two, so they deserved their pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize.
But they did incredible things, I recently learned about Eugenia's history to be a dote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
He made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one who brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s.
Thank you.
thousands of lives were saved, I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eugenia worked actively.
Until 2004.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And you know what?
It died in 2011 when I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
How did I lose it?
They didn't give an idea to the frightening that that made me know about them recently, very bronze, that's why I tell stories of female scientists.
To honor those who went.
But, above all, to not lose those who are.
Thank you very much.
We lost a long time at school learning ortography.
The kids.
They keep losing a lot of time at school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
What does a new ortography need?
I think so.
What does it need or better?
I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
Are they bouncing from the century to the century?
It's been a long time since.
Since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and tell how we write.
Each sound had to correspond a letter.
Each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound.
They should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
That's it.
Because Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French.
He always had a strong resistance to write too different.
How do we say this?
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we would uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided us.
A good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological.
The one who says we have to write.
Second, as words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, that's it.
We stayed with Hesmudas, whom we wrote, but we don't say anything.
So we stayed with velaries and decorations, which, unlike what many people believe.
They've never been differentiated in the pronouncement of Spanish.
This is how we stayed with Jes.
And sometimes they're asperous as in people.
And sometimes they sound waves like in cats.
That's how we stayed with grains, feces, and comicks.
There are three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time, big amounts of that time of plastic and child brain.
Indicate.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full of exceptions.
We were transmitted in many forms, implications and explanations.
The idea that spelling was something fundamental.
From our training.
However, I have the feeling.
Until the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
ortography serves.
To uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example.
In ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved.
In puntuation, yes.
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing, with ortography, no.
With ortography or is it good or bad?
Second, don't you add the right standards?
But then, wouldn't it be more likely to simplify the current rules?
So that it's easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly.
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
So that all that time we dedicate to teaching ortography today.
We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to abolish.
The orthography is not that everyone writes as they want.
Sign language is a common tool.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental.
That those common criteria are the simplest possible.
Especially.
Because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down.
When ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel at all.
The quality of language.
Chorus.
I work every day with literature to say it of gold, frightening, servant, gongora, I see.
Sometimes they write men, without H. Sometimes they write "scribing with scholarship."
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between those texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention still at the time.
But it's not a quality.
But let me go back to the teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a bit irreflexive.
The teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is when things like they are, that makes all the sense.
In our society, orthography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the blame of raw, the educated of the ignorant, regardless of the content.
From what is being written.
You can manage or stop getting a job by a H, who put it or stopped putting it.
You can become an object of public mockery once.
Pictured.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers.
Or individuals related to teaching the first letters.
Those who promoted ortographic reforms, those who realized that sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the highest ortographic reform that had indeed occurred in Spanish language, which was the one in Chile.
It's half-time.
This 19th century.
Why then?
How to take the post of those teachers?
And start?
To move forward in our ortography I am here.
In our intimacy, the 10,000 would want to put on the table some modifications that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate HMUDA.
There, where we write a cheese, but we don't say anything, we don't write anything, it's hard to think what kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone all the mistakes that cause HEMUDA to us.
Bélarga and Becuerta used to say, "You've never been distinguished in Spanish language." We chose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argue, not with one, let's eliminate the other, "I and Ye," let's divide the functions, the "the" that the sound sounds.
Gato, magician, sloth, and that the drop turns to the sound "asspected."
Jarave.
Tirafa, people.
Argentine.
And I know, that one, Iceta, is an interesting case.
Because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases the differences of pronouncy must be attended.
Now I used to say, "Ese and seta," in some places correspond to a sound in two to two, and in three letters, we lower two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic.
They are not that much.
The Spanish Academy Real, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified.
That language is linked to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool for everyday use and that sometimes the attachment to history, traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
for the use.
Today.
That explains, in fact.
That our language is much more.
That those we know, that we have geographically close, were modifying ourselves historically, for example.
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater, to theater, we were of quantity, we were of symbols, symbols.
And little by little, some roads start to be removed in the dictionary of the Academia Real Academia, flour, harmony can be written with H or H.
And we're all fine.
Does it sound like me anyway?
This is a moment.
Especially appropriated to deal with this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously, from below, up.
Because they are the users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
and that authority in some places.
A gym in other places is a dictionary, in other places, it's a ministry.
A lot of time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the level of words, it's less true.
For the gramatic level and almost I would say it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed from above.
There were always the institutions that focused on the norms.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Until today.
writing always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks.
But at our time...
The era of social media.
That's suffering a revolutionary change.
It was never written as much as now.
Never many wrote so much at the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we are watching on a large scale wild ortographic shapes.
Even people with impecable ortography, hyper-educated, when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks are behaved.
They ride the ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication.
For now, there.
Copic abuses, individuals.
But I think we have to pay attention to it.
Because they are probably telling us that a time that is assigned to writing, a new place.
I'm asking for that writing.
With new criteria.
I think we would do bad to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a more attempt to meet the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose.
etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't reach ortography, besides seeing Latin, Greek, Arabic.
With a simplified ortography?
Let's recover etymology at the same place where we are now.
Eymological dictatorships.
A second objection covered by those who say.
If we simplify spelling, we'll stop distinguising between the words that today differentiate in just one letter, that's true.
But it's not a problem.
Our language has anonymous, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit money, the traject we put from the things we bring.
In the vast majority of situations, the context disciples any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
It's more comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one that people say.
I don't want to change.
I mourn like this.
I got used to this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortography.
Give me your eyes.
(Laughter) This objection, in part, is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules?
To those we don't want, they let us write as we are used to.
And it is expected that time feels.
The new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform that touch so much damaged habits.
The consensus is in favor, the level of alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs prevent us from moving forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past.
Is it to improve?
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree and clean our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us.
I'm convinced.
What do we do with that?
In the modest field.
But importantly of language.
Are we going to be letting them go to the next generations?
A future?
Better still.
(Applause) Thank you before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris.
And say to myself.
I didn't hide from those eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and death.
QD: Maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Surprisingly, all the scientists I approached andaugurated monocratic images, the discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
The whole universe entered my mind.
That is, it was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy.
It became peace.
This image.
You see her.
This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And there's another one.
It's the brother of another else, and that's how I could teach you infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death is more than an end.
It represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life.
This is a project.
For me, this teaches me.
That our pureest material essence.
We are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror.
There's perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
(Applause)
(Applause) In Argentina.
The INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
From the ability that the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A building of education?
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with pedagogies.
Digners, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
A mixture?
About innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that.
changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advanced.
(Applause) Today, I'm not the scientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times in this path, cinema or literature.
It has been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From bigamorphoses, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until I ganged.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home.
We stop asking more questions.
From the most extraordinary corners, human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Do you want an unconscious logic?
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than on relevance.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
It's also very unique to human beings trying to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese Government, in just 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease.
But he had sequenced his genome and had done it publicly.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology.
It calls the optimistic section.
The same here makes many of us handle or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages.
thinking that in reality nothing will happen to us.
It makes the major politicians in Europe and many world's tropicators lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen now?
To us.
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up inculpable or stigmas.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to prevent people from getting sick already contagiating others.
However, in Japan, everyone falls down.
The first thing makes people between Manorzabe don't contain and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you only use more stairs they get sick.
So this would be a sort of acusatory crossing.
To know who's sick and who's not for wearing no more chairs.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the estimation and this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Who knows?
And what we have discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability for the case.
Finally, we think.
What we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we need is motivation to do.
This discovered it now, for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that was extremely difficult to change.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know some consequences.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the previous need.
And the world does revolve.
But also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes.
By their predisposition to restring individual liberties, to confin people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely prior to us.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of paying attention.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also to govern ourselves and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we were, where we moved, to whom we found.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our transitory load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Let's assume even more.
That this agreement can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
That those who are in your child if they are at home, those who are not at risk can go out.
And we keep on this mental experiment.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the stone.
It doesn't disappear completely, but there are fewer people die and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop economy and the world in a way.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to give up our data, the risk they were a bad use of them is still like that.
There's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
How could I choose if you feel good or bad to do that?
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
I found, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom.
which are fundamental values, pillars in the sea.
On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and most efficient to solve panels.
Maybe we give our data in a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago.
With HIV, luck also leaves freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When I spent all this.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free?
And care.
Are they going to fly less environments in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Would we also be that taking part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think more freely than ever?
What do we want it to be the compreservative sex of the choir?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia and Argentina.
I had been many times in...
Museum, with waves full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
I've seen a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it " sea samples."
They are relatives of sea wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment ...
I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea's dollar broke, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
But no.
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me.
To study.
Chinese dinosaurs and animals who lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today.
It was so different that not only human beings didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
What is a quantity that we paleontologists?
We mentioned myself every day, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter.
In the head.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago, I have traveled.
Effects and fossil studies from all over the planet, to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa.
Studying fantastic fossils.
It has also led me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally.
We thought about these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a wonderful and full of fossils.
What are left to be discovered?
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world.
To look for dinosaurs and the vast majority of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are of the last period.
What did dinosaurs live on Earth?
What we call the creptic period.
This is already about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South Hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common meatm belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While for that time...
In the northern hemisphere there were other families of carnivores, like, for example, Aurid ducks.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of South was not.
Surprisingly, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the North Hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in a juryic.
In the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her key meat specially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time.
They completely denied the planet.
For the first time they achieved gigantic size, for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the herbivores' niches, carnivores, omnivorous in everything.
The planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years.
SV: With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships, we went to explore.
The rocks of the Patagonia's Law.
And that leads me.
One of the stories, the discoveries we were able to do.
In the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon.
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
You see, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the size of a dinosaur.
I got closer.
I left next to me, I shooled.
I was really held.
I asked myself what it was and the Bello knew it was, after studying years of bones and anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the track part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happened.
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it.
After several days we were able.
To cover it with bones, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given from winter.
It was a year, long waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
From the statistics?
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was there.
Very good.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way its skeleton.
And that's where the excavation really begins: to throw it away, layer, those sediments that were burning.
Where it embraces us, it's a very exciting moment, for the first time it's returning to the superficies.
An animal?
They lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Genema had to have died, it had to be covered by sedentary layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sedentary layers, and that food was transformed into sedentary rocks.
In that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Then, all that buried rocket had to rise up to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a raise.
From all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosion.
These caps, hoods, even ...
Let's start discovering.
These layers contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking from those hills.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The pathologic wind, that doesn't lose.
And then we could carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain to grain.
All rocks that cover the bones of ...
These dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we could see.
This dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor.
Of the abelizens, those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
That's what we thought.
That is, long before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate being due to a big ocean, at the time of Changea, when all continents were united in a big supercontinent.
Now not all discoveries follow this trajectory.
Some discoveries are really made in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we transport to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We went to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those red blocks.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now this dinosaur is very special, in addition.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur mining didn't look like any other way.
We contract or knew about the northern hemisphere.
Studying their remains we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
The Atlantic Ocean hadn't yet formed, which is used today to these two continents, but once again, we had a case.
That is to say, of restricted animals, the only ones of the South hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Living on climate models, what we see is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that was possibly the existence of a big is true.
In the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy who had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere.
The lack of water.
What I had isolated these vaccines was not a desert full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs.
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we've really told us fantastic, fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in rocks, that have been formulated for millions of years in our planet, trapped, every tanto.
The animals and plants that lived in the past.
While they were training.
The Earth is a big book.
It's a huge amount of websites.
Scrites over 4500 million years.
And life.
I listen to a prepondering place.
In this story, in the last 3800 million years.
There were millions of pages still to read this book.
What if we really want?
To know our planet, its poems, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays.
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
It's also key.
To project a future.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would read so many books later and they would see so many movies.
I dream of healing.
To find magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
So time.
It gives us a happiness bathroom.
Through the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Sarry Potter.
It's empire without suffering small villages.
And you don't have the panorama position to defend them.
But something like that as a child.
Who happened to me?
And almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation.
You have to live.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is, maybe.
The main part of all ideas, something like the zero idea of this I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Going back to our mind with him.
Power and practical ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
Besides these rings, fix bicycles.
They go around half a half.
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
To develop in ourselves the habit.
We have to think.
And we give the time to think.
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I seen the saying?
Who only has a bottle?
See all the problems like a slap.
But if we have to remove a torn, a hammer is useless.
Neither realizing his slap.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a wheelchair.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools are called "Mental Mental Memes."
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 of them out of a hill.
If we have many mental models.
Our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to broaden the box of tools of our head.
Isn't it?
All the problems will be worried to us.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and at the table on the side.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or because of a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
He didn't realize it.
Of what?
When I say this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In Switzerland.
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was unplegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to really learn.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other important stairs.
To have a discussion.
And lose friendship, for example.
An hour of money and it took free.
Or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale impacts what we're going to do.
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And impresions have emotions for us.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
A lot of data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they didn't make us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those pressions generate emotion.
Fear.
And fear of creating acts generates option.
We are all now stored preventively what is moving.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times.
It's important to act when we don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric ones.
"Casting is one thing."
Is it hungry?
Have you failed?
You have an immediate reward.
How can we get married?
But very different farms.
Do the effort now.
For something you're going to take advantage of within six months or a friend.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But the organism creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But I leave lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now!
What's still?
We feel, we live.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we thought it would last six months.
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last.
The month are sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of the ship!
A high school classmate that would not be 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely.
To find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same.
Are there so many unlikable things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible.
And it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with human sense.
And it was the best, the intelligent way of coexisting with uncertainty.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
Of serious things.
Although they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
Why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
With a high schoolmate who wouldn't see that sequence.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And for people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
We can surround ourselves with people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
An interview Borges 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interview asked me, "That same answered to you."
This same question four years ago.
"Well, I know what has left me."
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be accepted with new ideas.
The new ideas are emerging.
And to be always open.
to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to emotional sport.
That's why they need the cost of a man.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives.
They will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
From a manual?
For the education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But to the idea, yes.
It has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, at all times.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015 that means today, 6 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here had already finished elementary school.
The university, Harvard, has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, a woman is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was it.
This idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
Yes?
Help your husband.
which is an irrational being.
What a cisteric?
It was true, in fact, a century ago, women believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them taking 5,000, maybe.
They thought this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Why are we living?
The amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing.
A conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm.
Politics that we have lived in economics, letters are nothing next to this, we are putting aside the idea that truth...
It's true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this.
We can see the world that our mind allows us to see.
Not everyone.
Not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about whether the world is.
That there is outside, we can once understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe.
That interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretive framework?
What is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
We knew it was September 24th, because all of us here agree with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, Ebreu, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendaries, or more they exist.
On September 24th, it wouldn't make any sense, every thing we say, every goal.
We are part of a very strong social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
Cats live without calendaries.
My dog appreciates the hot and the one at this moment is alone at home.
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I didn't know what it had become.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
She looked at a apple falling.
He wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
And the trips that he made, to know the animals he saw.
Everything that had been accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
And...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do.
If you don't have the context, you can't think of an idea.
The birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, or has never been.
But if it was born, it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we're thinking now, and the same thing is what we see in scientific movements, technological innovation, which are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
The revolutionary change.
How did we see it?
For thousands of years women went.
Those who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
Half of the scientists today in the world are women. Half of the university professors are women. Look all the creative energy that humanity has lost to think of the way women were not useful for anything else than for cleaning breads.
How many medicines, how much intelligence?
How much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea.
What can we do?
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that copy was created to study this process.
which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You'll say.
But how in the Greeks, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same gender, both men and women or any other, transgenere that occur to you today.
They always existed, in every culture, at every time.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But he had never thought about it.
What?
Sexuality of a person.
Anomala, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was.
Totally, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent.
It was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Vitoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You'll do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to blame you, it's not true, it's a great social control. (Applause) You don't say the woman of your fellow man.
(Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it, and then that's a terrible social control form, because it dominates us, dobly, on the one hand, do you know we can't leave it, it's as if we were deprived of eating?
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong, the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world, they didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before.
No, or the Jews, or the blacks without leaving the slavery, we don't even speak when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some cases today is ideal.
We all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood, this has just been raised now, in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
to be exhausted.
But in many parts of the world today are completely legal: this was possible, for the change of paradigm, and why this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed people, accept their identity, make them respect, and then make others understand that they are also human beings with full right.
(Laughter) But there's a drama of social struggles and you have to get into jail that discriminated me.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To be respected as a woman, I have to be just a woman, as black, just black and the same as only gay.
And gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people, that I might not like to like a guy, what do I know?
However, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
From prisons.
50 years ago.
Look how old sun is.
I was a homosexual boy.
(Laughter) And I didn't even know what it was to be a troop, or stupid, or homosexual, or anything, and at the same time I knew that it caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that I didn't know what it was to make a homosexual boy, I didn't know the homosexual word, and they didn't even say to me that, my schoolmates told me, "Where, we're going to screw up to hitch."
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so bad for it to come out like this?
What was that?
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
He had the positive side.
I learned to make me respect.
I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black people too, would have learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to...
And I forced myself a lot and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got into a terrible prison, which was to make 24 hours out there.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With translator, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I am also a person, saying that I am complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
20 or 30 years ago this idea had been having.
It arises from understanding that the facts don't exist, that cities exist.
(Laughter) (Applause) There are contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it: we are contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume standing there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said, and when I took charge of it.
Because when an idea is incarnated, it's that it doesn't move, while we have it only in our heads it's not useful.
That's where it's body.
I left prison.
And leaving my prison was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
I am today, or they told me that there is a list of things we need to survive, called La Cana was there.
What a weird idea, to live constantly with this rough, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
It counts the things we need to survive, and if better it had the things we need.
Not to explore.
But exploring is something difficult, terrifying.
Each personal and place are completely different.
The constant movement brings us extraordinary situations, to adapt, is a moment.
Why long or small?
full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
And when everything I did, I've erased by someone else's voices, you, I'm not even in a microphone.
What does the intensity of your ideas double and besides all those ghosts than the obstacle?
But once I said that.
Once you can get your words out, an avalanche and ideas come to you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are Jews.
You stop choosing, seeing your paraguas and covering them, or doing a side and in dad you each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy.
Afterwards, back, jump, run, run.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not called.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs.
And even though life controls music, I believe the movements.
Designs that take us to moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
Remember that you will probably not be an artwork.
But they will allow you to revive the exact way in which these stars are seen.
In the formula that he saw that face when he spoke about what he liked the most, speed opened it to your heart.
Or how do you break when you talk?
That voice, that voice that you know so much, that knows that I'm probably looking for something that you lose.
That voice.
Your best friend.
You just have to be there forever.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little pile to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend.
Without that, yes, without that, it's a canasta, I cannot survive.
What we grew up in girls cities.
But it's funny.
Have we ever choose?
Then, the opportunity to be here.
Very cool to be a little bit like this, in such a detail.
I can't progress in the way I would like to.
G.G: Me.
There it always shows a person on stage for what they were already in years.
No more.
And with a belly, wake up her experience without offending the doctor.
They come to remember that all the past was better.
Is this really the case?
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer.
When we think about this.
I unfortunately remember my friends all my life.
And Juancho, ranch and Emanuel.
These photos you're seeing there.
It's from 2009 when I live to go to high school.
What can I say to my friends?
I love them a lot, they are like my brothers.
And they are three people super capable.
that as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to be able to study what they liked.
They stayed in each city.
And be surprised, until today.
You can't get a job that allows you to fulfill your dreams.
Me, that's the fourth of this photo.
The mark of the absence of opportunities was also present.
My parents, who are workers, made an effort on human beings that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that my fears knew that if they stayed here in the city...
I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be with all opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
We lived in the midst century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress are with a speed that surprise us all.
And it collapse the borders and the barriers that insist on people.
And in this context?
Cities to make more and more important tales.
Let's be honest, it's our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68 percent of the world's population will live in a city.
As if that number doesn't sound.
It should be almost aware of every 10 people around the world.
Seven out of every ten.
If more and more people choose to live in cities.
And that's where we have a greater chance to progress.
What is it that explains in two systems while the weapons of cities seem to stay in time?
Others make progress, they're vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that they want them to cheat the cow when they come out from that door to return to their homes.
This is the strategy.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
To my concerns.
As a professional future in the field of international relationships happens exactly for this.
To connect cities.
With the opportunities the world has to start.
Not in an indiscriminated manner, but sitting in our strengths, in our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you may ask: How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through projects.
What is the quality of life of the population?
It has the obligation.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago, so you can begin to notice a couple of things.
Summing a fifth, to me, my girlfriend, is the group.
Do you know what it is?
It was drinking something from the castle.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of investment relationship is given.
As they improve the quality of the photos of the phones.
What we were in it, we were going to improve. Does anyone have a couple of tips?
And we have to receive fights, but...
Do you know what we share until today?
It's already from the deep asthical that we have each other.
The mark of the missing opportunities.
For example, who is also right in this photo.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2002.
He was a national champion.
But today, although I want to edit, I had a geography teacher.
It doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday working absolutely to be able to live.
He's the one in my left below, just there was his birthday.
How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces in our country?
(Laughter) But since I didn't count on this possibility here, then we are changing career without being able to find what was really passionate.
And I can't even get a job that allows seven economic independences.
Finally, it's Manuel.
It's a genius of management, but genius don't know anything.
Do you tell it?
We work all day in his place that built from nothing itself.
Time studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
Why?
We, as young people, don't have...
Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
Recently, I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 cohetes worldwide.
To participate in a weekend in New Delhi, the capital of India.
I traveled in Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
Yes!
Besides saying it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I would like to share with you today are accidents.
What?
You can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
You have to be willing to find them, they don't come alone.
Our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
We don't have one that offers money to the youths, the US, nor the Chinese, nor anyone.
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
What do you have?
And a state that is there to come out to the world and bring opportunities to them to act to develop themselves.
Once again.
If we want better cities, we know the world strategically.
Remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, I found myself to go to study.
With three days to turn 18.
They were me, very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be told in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to have a city.
What is studying?
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Why is this?
I have to go to taste.
Who's from my friends?
And nobody you know.
It's necessary to provide tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
So, how are you?
What's more beautiful?
Let's take alas to the city that had made you.
And with a strategy, what can we do?
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco.
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Or to not go so far away, Emanuel.
If I had the necessary programs to be able to keep adding to what I have.
Is it true?
Like that!
Is it true?
You can see the fatal.
Yes!
All of this.
What am I telling you?
They don't think enough arguments.
Do you want another example?
That's fine.
This one!
Is tattoo?
She tells me when, finally.
I could overcome the unique depression.
In which I fell for having feet in my city.
After two intentions of suicide.
Enumerable, psychological sequences.
He didn't even talk.
Much, a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop going?
We have to go out strategically.
We don't eat a final point in our cities.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) I am a surgeon.
Since always the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work.
We have to look for it.
More reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years.
My research.
In my case, in the sofa.
It was based on it.
To look for it.
The reasons.
To operate.
increasingly less patients.
This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
Of course not alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
What does this mean?
We do it.
With biological platforms.
What are they?
Like maps.
What do we give them?
To the tissue.
To use their own ability.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
robotics.
They were giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What happened before -
It seemed like science fiction.
Today it's almost daily, it's amazing.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients.
That they avoided.
To have to become a surgery.
With all this I told you about.
I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
Do I have it?
Every time.
More work.
(Laughter) I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a time like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese, and in addition to my work for many years I've had contact with literary, sociological and anthropological questions of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to be a first question.
Why, Japan?
He couldn't avoid the greatest impact on the contagium.
If it was in January, the first case went on.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
It was having the population of the third age.
Wallors of the world.
Sing in the second country with more smokers per number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear advance.
And the identified one.
Until now.
We know this new virus runs a very contagious virus.
In these demographic data, Japan introduced us a cocoter that would enable a great propagation of the disease.
Basically.
Many people, not so much.
And a fourth of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society.
Education in such a way, that answers in an organic and united way.
Before any event that compromises her.
Japan passed through war, Tifions, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, transgenation.
He had to overlleve catastrophs.
Naturals?
It is generated by man.
We can think of this.
With something that likes Argentinians, soccer teams.
For example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day.
It has infrastructure.
In which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
Social distancing directives.
And it's full.
And individual behavior.
Whether in society or in our own homes.
The Japanese population has not established for hundreds of years ago.
You don't need to say "no to embrace".
Not giving a kiss.
Because it doesn't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
That is to say, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
(Laughter) You don't have to invite you not to beorn or shoot on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board when they feel reflected.
Not to protect oneself, but to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They did two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
I mean, you'll surely know the sillas' game.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they get out of one.
In each round.
And this experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves E.
It chooses this way of being.
It's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
In the example there are children, but we can see how a collective society works.
(Sigh) Do you help yourself?
Because every immigration contributes to the good of everyone.
