We know at that circle the end of today, in Virginia Churchill.
At this moment, through distant lands and music, orchestra, we filled it with the dear of Argentine matches.
We saw it with a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we go, the main character of our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play it, so it sounds like a hole and you can dance.
I breathe and live in Neubié.
One lives in Buenos Aires and I recommend that we had to learn to work on the territory.
We call it by video.
Someone could hear their part, so the other can play it on them.
And that's how we are talking about the repertoire.

Do you know they don't even have what worries me in tools?
The patients and relatives of those who recovered us.
Once, they cry, they throw them away.
But there's another thing that this pandemic comes to me.
Something that we are dedicated to checking the contents of social networks and fighting misinformation, we were already seeing and not worrying about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu, in 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global level, was much lower.
The pandemic, COVI-19 is the first pandemic that lives with infection.
What is infodemia?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
It's called "catirda," because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
We don't know.
But when it comes to health issues is much more dangerous, because what can affect what can put in danger is our lives directly.
There's no idea of the amount of waste on YouTube, Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Maybe it's an idea, because they doubt without a virus, they suffer daily the viralization of content in verifying.
For four weeks, with my team, checking, fools, we work without resting, fake, truths that circulate over this new disease.
Do you know what?
Suppose, and we are aware that alone you can't stop this information balance, it's impossible.
Sometimes they are frustrated.
That's why I think it's useful and I tell you what we discover, what we find.
All the contents, linked to 99, can fit or classify in four categories.
Today, by telling them, they will be able to be more prepared.
Being more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this balance of information on us.
And since it finds theory it's simple.
The first one has to do with contents related to the origin of the disease.
cooperative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them in Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
Nothing in this time.
Also, linked to a theory that human beings created this virus, don't take it seriously, it discarded, there is no evidence of that.
The second category relates to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading in a scientific study of a Pepper that proved that the virus lived a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window.
That's not the case.
There is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to false treatments and shorts.
It's called "It's dangerous."
It's what has to be more attentive.
that has to force us to be more careful.
There's no truth that drinking hot water with lemon we kill albums.
making drinks with hot water and salt or making steam is coming a couple of disappearing from our body if we are infected.
And it's not true that there is already a vaccine that will heal us.
There is no Cuban flag that managed to create it, and there is no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications.
At the moment, it doesn't have a completely satisfactive answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures.
Or to take apart from different measures to the opposites of authorities.
It's farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social isolation was dissolved, 15 days ago, a little more, a failure of credit that said that Cuentena started the 3 in the afternoon.
It obviously generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say it's going to fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that not only we'll be locked up in our homes, but in communications.
The information is generally trying to generate panic and anxiety.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health Organization or the Defies World Health Ministry.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
It's that we are not good with doubt, we are not comfortable when we are missing certainty.
And then we move forward, we move forward to find that certainty without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you see a content, it's not cheated, you don't share it.
Let's keep comparing with doubts, so common: "I don't share with doubts."
And that is taking care of our ego.
If you receive someone's content, and share that false, don't streets, with signs or affection.
And if you share a content and then you realize that it's false, don't streets, apologize and correct.
And that's not stupid, but alive.
The pandemic is dynamic.
It can be infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day.
Science works intensely to get the cure, but it needs time.
In addition, there are evidence and information vaccines.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era in which the answers and certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those brickets with blue content, because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we'll be much worse than tolerate them.
Thank you very much.
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things: I learned that working in the middle of the pain of other people doesn't make you a bitter, or sad person.
That's the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence and be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
Maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a thread in an act of reconnection, forgiveness, love or transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to create a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generate the nearby presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more on our omnipotentia, be humble, and not feeling frustrated, or failed, when despite having done everything possible, the result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times it's good to see that there are many people suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
Finally, I learned and I keep learning that it's not just about healing.
Above all, it's about relating and accompanying.
Researching love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
To research love and compassion can leave a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
I turned 40 years ago.
After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more personal topics.
I fly and after several pages I realized that it would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, my female condition.
Why, when a man is present, enough for him to say, "Hi, I'm Mr. Durant and I'm a writer."
For a woman like me, I have to decide goodwar, I'm a writer and I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
It was a topic already written in many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
We can remember approximately that half of humanity is men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity is manliness and the other half, is feminity. So why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30 they would have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition, I would have surprised myself.
Are you angry?
I'm really enjoying it at 40.
It's such an obvious topic, but at the same time so ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations to a man.
You just have to walk in the street to see that humanity is divided into two groups that walk differently, who dress differently and who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity.
The myths that exist on women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete, but I was going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological, physiological, technological issues.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, man is everything.
In most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side.
Man is humanity, man is the whole, the main one, the essential.
Love is the other.
It's the other.
Women are the second sex, the second of sexes.
Women are not essential, they are not defined by themselves, they are defined by the man who is everything.
So I followed my research and I realized that in the history of civilization many times excluded groups are created.
Included like blacks, excluded as projectmen, or Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They say "us" they identify themselves.
However, women don't identify themselves easily.
They don't say us.
In fact, a white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white man than with a black woman.
Would this bourgean woman identify themselves more easily with a burghan man than with a projectionary?
Women don't create a community, women don't say us because they live dispers inside a group of men.
Anywhere, men are very satisfied to believe each other and feel the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists sought theories in religion, in theory, to explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions, several men usually ask me, "You're an opine because you're a woman."
Of course, as if for having ovaries and uterus and rule and hormones I would take away any objectivity.
As if they, when they wrote their theories, they didn't have their hormones and their tender texts showing them to think.
I want to be aware of these differences and understand them.
Sharing what I understood.
Sharing what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
And within everything I told you that I studied biology, physiology, and so on, I realized something, that the behavior of women is not dicted by nature, but by culture.
Nature doesn't dictate society all, it's the culture that explains how we are interacting in our society.
In other words, you are not born a woman, you get to do it.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer, and at the same time I was already recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
It was a complete, integral individual.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her to get married, become an slave of her husband, having children, to dedicate them to creating them.
Men explains that everything is natural to him, therefore, his feminity resumes to that.
I don't intend to change the feminine condition, there's a lot to do.
What I do intend is to be aware.
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions with free will.
I want to share, that each woman and every man can and must decide what they want for their sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man, has to define what they want to do at work.
If I want or not to work with free will, free will.
And I want to be aware that this effort has to be done together between men and women.
And I want to be aware that, then, the powerful might have answered these questions, we will live in a whole society made of men and women completely complete and free.
Thank you!
Thank you!
(Applause)
Good afternoon, I guess you have studied for today.
You surely know the steamer, which is an oven in search of freedom.
An imno that talks about thoughts.
Thoughts are like golden wings on mountains and colors.
In the end, he says, and this spiral these thoughts so that they give them value to the suffering.
It's something that Verdi wrote, supreted searching for more than 100 years and we can take it as his own.
Are all ready?
Also, right?
Respire now.
But probably, they have already been breathing at home.
(Laughter) But now, because I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this.
The court?
(Laughter) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) "Hello, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, God, love, love, love, love, love.
(Laughter) (Laughter) Carriba, let's go.
Woman 2: If you want to reach my world!
No!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

A couple of years ago, a group of mine went out to marry for the abortion legalization.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the phonomenon's time, came with me to Congreso.
I still remember his face when we got there.
But I look around and he told me with a smile and a huge surprise: Wow, it's full of kids!
Actually, we were almost all girls.
Well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that today is super natural to me: talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of books and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, the chronics in Arnia.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all there are villains that oppress, discriminate against others, that say they are more.
In all there are teenagers, children like me, who stand up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude that many teenagers see regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like the one of those books, we have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in a terrifying distopy like that of climate change in which we, the youths, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal.
Anywhere where there is a death bag, there must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
(Applause) For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
It's a culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is good or bad.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
And as long as many people prefer to avoid these topics to not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations, I believe there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone in their political position is not the same as fighting because I am in mouth and in River's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
If he can't give me the same, the way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that, opinion, is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say better to be quiet, I say "men."
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot.
Because by talking, we can build our future and regulate our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see markets and political spaces in general not as dangerous, not as it scares, but as a space of personal and social growth, of union and inspiration.
I hope there's always, but there's always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly and say, without a little surprise, it's full of children.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a cup like this to take water home?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted, had this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life, and without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings, we are composed of over 65% of water, and despite that, every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, main laws, through agriculture of our large companies' farming, and even our daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not only about the appearance of diseases around the world, but also the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
A thousand children a day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world.
This means that if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is a paradoxical way since this continent counts with 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we rise a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries, almost 20 million people, that is, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth is in front of this situation.
It's exactly this question that made four doctors from Zarabota leave everything behind and that we are the bad guys and meet again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, founded just like Watter Water.
Let's make the luck that we have indeed had, because we were born from a carcavan ID, so we call the "Ferla Blanca" and, above all, we caressed with a tremendous desire to return to the group.
During the road, we joined meet with rural communities and rubbish communities that rarely have water at home.
All of them go to rivers, votes, or mainly to be able to see.
But always with a common problem: water and pinea.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the side, which, as you can see, represents a huge cost of resources for people who almost have no age.
Money resources to buy these subsidies or time resources to go pick up the fire and then save it.
And we asked ourselves, what can we do to help increase this problem?
Starting from the basis that none of us were experts in the matter, we put our hands to the work and after many weeks of research, filtered by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to teach you to tell me.
It's a filter that works almost like a color.
The contaminated water goes through the bread, and this contains all the largest particles than with a water molecule (Laughter) leaving only clean water.
Of course!
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately.
Besides, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider that it only needs the water weight to make the type work.
Can you imagine the impact of these filters in the lives of all these people?
Well, now, we want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story.
Leocruz is a 21-year-old kid who belongs to the colony 15th October, in Trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream that was to study English and end up being a teacher in his community.
But it's funny, both him and all his popless, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by ethical stages around him.
In our work, Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride that it was to be able to see all those agents in those communities in order to fulfill, among other things, their dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people in Mexico or Atemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, have access to drinking water for around 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatemán Proy came up with an idea, we realize a little of the dream we had the opportunity to live.
But in this dream, we were never alone.
Before leaving, more than 400 people brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign, which was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of water filters.
And nine months later, fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Well, we have created a social movement that has made from the trip of these four friends an unstoppable caravan against the world's crisis.
But there's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis can be one of the risks of the biggest risks the one facing the human being in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not that we origate us.
So we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident, we have created many needs that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
We have seen this project with our own eyes.
We have lived it personally.
We've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago, where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the manantials that supported communities.
Therefore, they were completely taking off the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, that they're doing for those lands, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil?
So that all of us can fill the deposit of our vehicles, what they are doing is polluting, is destroying the forests and rivers of communities or orangers of the Amazon.
We've been there and it's amazing.
They are making the communities have to be moved.
And in the future, this will likely cause is that it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible and living it hasn't given us something that is open.
Actually, it's something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us.
I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's world crisis is a reality that not only affects developed countries.
The world's world crisis is a reality that, on November 12th, 2016 is directly affecting all of us and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far.
In California, with a world of technological development, people are imulating people for consuming too much water, they are cutting their minister for several hours.
In Spain, we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the most water houses in the future.
If we really want to make a change, if we really want to impact on this planet, what we have to do is all of us, consciously.
What we all have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
What we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to build poths in Guatemala to overcome these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the life that these big companies say, that, of course, they are not doing things right now.
Pretend and appreciate the amazing luck that we have to get to our homes, open the glass of water and always leave water.
Or it's not like that.
Let's stop worrying this resource.
It seems like no, but believe me, it's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to achieve the change we want to see in the world.
Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
(Applause)
(Applause)
How nice is it for here?
Not to see so many attentive faces.
I'm going to start the conference by making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are energy sources and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency.
That can be measured, it can also be measured the electromognetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
It is proved that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than the thought.
The electromagnetic frequency that creates a thought is measured and when we see the frequency that gets into our heart is a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, you talk about the heart, I buy myself with you what I'm going to talk about from the heart, if you open the heart, you surely can receive 1000 percent of what I'm going to say to you.
If we get stuck in our mind, we will surely receive only one part of it.
So that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines to put ourselves in no context.
How is society today?
Raise your hand and say three or four answers, quickly, stand up!
Stracked.
Revolved.
in the USA.
The aggressive.
Very happy.
An accident of teeth.
Well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer.
You saw the answers you just gave, right?
And then there's another question: Is anyone here happy?
Raise your hand those who are happy.
Please, those I'm not happy, stand up.
But there are around 500 or 600 people here and almost everyone raised their hand, I can assure you that if I already give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Don't you think it's
What John?
What are we?
It's not society.
When do we talk about society?
Why do we refer to it?
Here, 100% of society is happy and happy.
And if they've always told us more or less questions, they'd have told us in that line: lost, decreased, faced, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
This is called mind oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is everything we lack, everything that's wrong, everything we see.
We are tied to the media of information where the answers stayed sometimes and we go to schools, we call them the day diary, to the kids, and we tell them, "Be good news, bad and neutral news."
After the money of the day, right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask a question or an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashionable.
When I ask this, once they say: " football, the Basque, the rugby."
Well, well.
I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are fashionable today: the first, national sport: complaint.
We complain about everything, did you know this?
The first thing is we leave the weather: heat that's 3 in January 3 in the afternoon.
Wow, how crazy, man!
What cold, what does it do?
Seven of July at 7 am.
First we leave the weather, then we leave the traffic, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife.
And if we don't complain about something, something is wrong.
When they ask me, how are you?
Effectively, it's full of happiness.
And I said: "What happened to you?"
Don't you complain about anything?
So, we have become a society of quologists.
It's like a title we have.
We complain about everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim, this can't be.
Does this have to change?
This is a disaster.
When you see what this is, you have to change, the country, the society, my wife of work, we are complaining all the time.
If we transform ourselves, balloons complained.
In other words, I have psychologists claimed and the maximum, or pinologists and all achievements.
The pirates of everyone.
Don't you think it's
Did you realize that?
Some of you have heard someone who says: "I don't feel the ability to operate this."
Well, wait for everything, I've already produced it with my friends.
A friend Fernando, who goes up to the t-shirt with him and I tell him, "Man, you know why he climbed the soy?
You understand that the tone is going down and down, you know?
And we left everything.
We spine of economy, politics, and there's something even more worrying: we've started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain, we claim, and we're immerssed in opinion.
What makes it have fallen in a kind of vital distancing.
You have to leave our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also have a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy we've had.
We started the day with a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue, which also makes us lose power.
Why, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the climate is not the case, because I was very overwhelming, and I came to give a conference and see with the rhythm, I wanted wonderful?
And the kidney says: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced to rain."
(Laughter) This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on.
Besides being in this society and leaving this society, especially in our generation, that we have left, in front of society, a moral crisis that even the most perverse mind of our grandparents could imagine.
Dearded, rejected and relaxed.
But in addition, we are making our children believe that we don't serve for anything, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money and that we don't have a future.
We don't just leave this, but we make them believe this.
This quote is shown: "You see how archety people are."
And what do you want to be in Argentina?
We hear this.
And if it were worldwide, what can we do?
We don't just leave this society as it is, but we also make them believe in the generations that well, that they can't change it.
A mistake.
For this, it's the self-fulfilling teacher.
Now, for a long time, I was there and I started to understand that knowledge was important.
I was training that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived.
I lived complaining that it was hell.
Because talent was important, I had to have talent, I had to experience and I became more and more engaged in this, I saw that all of them add up, everything summed up.
So I looked for more knowledge, more skill, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies.
The attitude multiplies there.
You know that the amount of zero is zero.
You, the attitude you have in front of life, is zero, that's a zero guy.
It has that negative attitude, that's a negative type.
You have a pessimist guy, you are a heavimist guy.
And if you have a deserved attitude, that's a type of merd.
Sorry, so I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position?"
The first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I was going to do, who was looking for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justifying, criticizing, rooting and showing what happened as protagonist, and the first thing I saw is that the protagonist leadership is a subway.
Or, well, this square meter that I have depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you and me.
And do you know what?
Here, in this square meter, I vibrate in the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why by handing a shirt that says "I respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, and I decided to live in a different world.
Because living in hell, I went through hell.
I didn't remember once I went to the subway and I told him, "Dear, give me three reasons for which I would have to keep living, wow!
It was very bad.
I was hell and I was in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full.
But hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision.
Because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back with a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
And where it begins to claim all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want.
And you know that you are what you do, but it's also what you stop doing.
If all the time we'll be waiting for someone to change this, we'll be at the oven, the guys, that is, we're what we do but also, we're what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started educating, they say there are many ways to educate.
For me, only one with the example.
Every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So it's already in the way to educate.
Reading the image of what we want to see.
Starting from our square meter, we have to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude.
I'm the protagonist of my life.
I am the one I want to change things.
If the protagonist is those people who change, they are not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare.
If you're with a group of failures, that's a failure.
That's what makes you a group of unhappy.
If you start a square meter, to contagiate solidarity, optimism, you start to emit that energy.
Because what energy does your square meter have to me?
Where is it from?
The important thing is not what we do.
The important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world, in Pasco, is to buy a kilo of side, you wouldn't do it, it doesn't matter here to not be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Environment" and she says to me: "These people took me and I the first one that made me happy is to catch," and I say to him, "Hey, you told 300 happy people, it's coast."
"No, she says."
It's not waiting.
What are you emitting?
A square meat, so nice!
What are you up to?
Does it allow you to respect?
Easy to meet you!
I have been grateful.
Embrace unconditional love.
What is emitting?
What does it do?
It's as a source of energy and according to what you put, it's what you receive.
This is like AM, FM, if you're in AMI and you go from one coast of AM to the other side, you're going to listen to Radio AM, now if you change your frequency and you move to FM, there's another melody, and it's more in FM, you have the frequency you want to hear, you can choose.
But if you are in the DNA, even if you go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that, that is, the world is how we created it.
They live in paradise, but hell is a decision.
If I get home in the morning, I start to say, "The first match is against myself," "Hey, I wake up, I don't get up," that one struggles with humour or with good humour.
A bad humour, or not, with good humor.
A good predisposed, bad predisposed.
Everything I have or see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences.
The excellence, or the half believed, is this difference.
The path you take is a blind one.
Since you get up, those victims I've become protagonists.
You will show what you want to build for the generations that come or you will make the interests that today are governing us and taking us out of domesticated nostress.
People drive it for fear.
My father told me a huge heritage.
I'd always say, "Start and fear I've never had."
Well, let's form, no, let's be more and more safe.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this rugby foundation without borders, which is the great blessing.
I invite you to see it, I invite you to know what I was doing.
Last week we gathered veterans of Argentine and Vietnam bottles, came a Royal Marim Britânico, a burk, and gathered Argentine competitions and together they gave a meeting message.
No one says, no.
And do you know who closed the talk?
It's my 12-year-old nephew.
Do you know what he said?
It was forbidden, that unit of measures is her.
If they taught me that they were the bad guys and now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No!
Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool.
That year, it's Maccio Segón.
I invite you to see.
I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the Ralco Foundation and without Borders.
Because in 2012, I went to work tank of gas to a conflict between realities and I paid for 70 years.
A place where I act was of lack, I thought I lacked a lot of things, and I understood that I was worried about what I lacked all the time.
One morning, I see a Palestine woman in Belén's city eggs with other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration.
So I ask, "What are you celebrating?"
So she says to me, "The water tank was filled."
What does the stage mean before today?
who has drinking water at home in order to take the whole week.
If you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
They celebrated them.
Isn't it?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy who asks him, "Do you know what the lamparadian genius is?
Everything through the translator, right?
I don't have any idea, so I can explain to him what that genius is in the lamp in the lamp, and I say to him, "I bring you a toy."
What do you ask me?
He looked at me all excited and said: "Give me the hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
And at that time I was connected with what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink, if I could give a bathroom, I would have to sleep.
So they lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had.
To conclude this, I want to propose an exercise.
If in this state, what are we now?
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes, close your eyes, imagine at this moment all the things we have to never give them value, we don't give them importance, as the fact of having a place to sleep, to be able to bathe, have water.
We start making a mental list of things we never realize or we thank.
Like health, like the possibilities we have, like our senses, our friends.
These things we take for scared, but we never list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with the feeling that they have been replaced or selected or chosen by all they have.
All the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until now, expressing that gratitude, standing up, applauding the strongest they can shout, doing whatever they want.
You have the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life if you feel it right now, from this moment.
(Applause) We are in a society at a moment I decide very well there, for the protagonists we can be in our lives, with what we have, with what we receive, avoiding, or the abundance we sleep, for the love of our loved ones.
(Applause) It comes up.
This is gratitude, we have to express.
(Applause) Well, stay there for a moment: the longest road to run is four sticks when we get to move from our heads, we connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we realize everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, but a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment, what we just felt and this feeling, remember that there's a place in the world of a little 10-year-old kid, the genius of the gradual lamp asks you what you're going to do, if we're going to the hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
And to music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
How do you need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music?
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us.
Since we are born in Latin, in bones, in rhythms.
The Sun goes out on the moon, one of my life, but also the music in the pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds.
Do we are little and play with sound as if it were a toy?
"Papá Pach," until we grow up and we bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go all together and grow in community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
You come to the talk ... Yes!
(Applause)
It's not easy to face this way in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be.
bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they're also known as school support.
One of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems. However, 5 or 10 years ago, I think that a few or none of us have heard this word, bullying, although it also usually says that this is nothing new, that we live it on our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues in childhood.
Before, it was called "Take a point to someone to mock," now bullying is said.
But I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new.
You have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
And this for various reasons.
First, we didn't have a word to name it, or name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
It wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to promote laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was something more or less normal, capable of an indeseeous consequence, an lateral effect, with the undesisted task of school coexistence, but not that serious.
Some could even think that this contributes to the children's education.
But there's something important, which is that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school drames were considered much more serious than those fights without importance that occurred in the recreations and in the halls.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now, on the contrary, it tends to be the opposite, bad grades and disciplinary repriments, it seems that they are increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying affects a more and more central role.
So there are simultaneous movements that happen at the same time.
On the other hand, they earn new priority for the reasons of school humiliation, which are the punishments applied by an authority, such as a teacher or a direct, to the students who did something considered incorrect, something prohibited by regulations or something considered they shouldn't be done.
Those scenarios that the same students apply among themselves for the most different reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or the personality of the victim.
If this is happening, the question is, why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change about which it's worth thinking.
We think that on the one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, supporters, bad grades, what operates there is guilt, guilt for having done something wrong.
Guilt is an internal, private emotion, it refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each of us, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it doesn't have to be bad, even me.
I feel guilty because I did something wrong.
In the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another type of emotion: shame.
It's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
Embarrassment is a public emotion, it doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong.
In the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others: the others, the eyes of others, that judge me in an incorrect, unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I don't have any fault, it's the others that exercise on my cruel look.
It's a transformation, and I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because it seems to me that the alien look, the look of the other, which obviously was always important, lately won a demeasurable weight, maybe uncomfortable, especially when judging who each one is, and how much it is worth.
And this hasn't always been like that, that's why I say it's a huge historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, which isn't from now that has been managing for decades, and that it's finishing to consume now, it's crystallizing now.
One of the most important ingredients of this transformation is the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
During a fundamental belief, during the 200 years of our previous ones, and it made 90, the conviction that there was inner life, something essential but invisible to the eyes, it was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and real way that the female appearances.
The appearances are not only considered wine, but also false, fragile, as something smaller, something without importance, compared to all the dissemination of that inner truth or beauty.
All of this are values and beliefs that remain between us but that we are abandoning them.
For example, in the case of good appearances I find it pretty clear that they are no longer so good, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in the last decades of importance of the personal image of the physical aspect, the theme of gyms, esthetic treatments, all of that.
It also matters a lot, if it's called a center, it's what you see.
The notion that the most important thing of each of us is something we don't see, but that are not trips, not that they are inside each one, but that are not trips, but something immaterial, like the soul or the spirit.
We believe less in that, and more and more in what others can see, what we show is what we do, and according to these transformations, others judge us from that notion that there is something inside, interiority, eternal, meditory, anchemical anamy, which would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this, a series of indices of transformations appear, and one of them would be the self-management, tactics or self-production techniques that are everywhere, and that are even recently considered a bad taste.
Let's think of an example: conquest, an obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "I like," this also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and who deserves to be admired.
The phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
We made a set, a infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries, going through real and shows and bullying.
I think that thinking about this broader context it doesn't surprises that today bullying has become something so serious, so serious, when intonestations and bad grades are increasingly serious.
And it seems that fault has lost a good part of its moralizing efficiency.
Guilt is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
This, of course, is very complicated, because it demands a management, an administration of two sides that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves, we don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk that the alien look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
We have become more vulnerable to the alien gaze, for the same reason.
We also see in complication, which is cyberbullying, when these mockets or disseminations spread on social networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc., and then what used to be privately was to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the school walls or at home, all of a sudden it exposes to millions of people.
Everybody knows it, so embarrassment becomes terrible, not much more serious, and we don't have where to take refuge, or inside oneself, or in intimacy, nor even dreaming of escaping to a certain island, that there are increasingly less or no more, no Wi-Fi.
It seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens, and with this dependence we developed in relation to ourselves.
And if all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do?
Is this better or worse than before?
It's good, bad.
How do we solve it?
Because the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues.
It seems that both guilt and embarrassment are mechanisms of social control and the fact that guilt is losing a good part of the future now and that embarrassment is magnificating, it's not good or bad in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind, it's a fact, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
Think about that what he wanted to tell.
Thank you!
(Applause)
If we talked to my children every day at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
She told me: "Mom, I want to live in a historical moment, but in good ones."
I work to investigate their education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And in those days I've come to think a lot about that.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage and we don't choose?
And I think that yes, we are learning some important things.
And I'd like to share with you these ideas that I've been walking around these days and that hopefully, one of them serves us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first time that, for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency to dare find new ways of teaching.
Innovation and education is something close to what is being talked about.
It was that until now it was happening isolately, separated.
Nowadays, for another, all of us, simultaneously, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and obliged by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance, and in this process we are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
For that we realized that we didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
There were many things that were already available, but that we had never had the urgency in difficult periods of use.
Create tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families, that are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our boxes of tools.
I propose to you, and little by half, the frustration that it brings, to have to adapt them so fast, even try to have patience, do them at the same time when things don't come out too, because we're also learning, we're taking care of the taste, getting new ways of teaching and learning.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know.
In yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, the oldest one started to show how to use the compound to make bank tricks to people of their age.
We're learning in community.
The second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school.
Just like it appeared once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn when and how.
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Those days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own time.
Some study more at night.
Others start with the subjects that are most interested in.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task.
Or a change in the web to finish understanding something that doesn't happen to you.
Or to learn something new that they wanted.
This also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy, kids, can be combined with other instances in which we are all together working in the parade.
And he also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them, from very young, to organize their time, manage the tasks and everything that needs to learn.
Because in my last reflection, nowadays, it's pretty much a question: What happens when we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, declarative way, but the skin in the body, the value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks, I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between home.
Not only those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
It may have a calm place to study, and the one who doesn't, the one who has here to ask and the one who doesn't.
It has to be all the tasks of care in the house and in which not.
The school, with all its difficulties, at least for hours a day, puts in parentheses those inequalities and helps all boys and girls to be protected and focused on learning.
And the educator worries a lot about how this will follow.
And I also wonder what will remain of what we're learning in this quarantine.
The feeling of these days is: "You know when the tide is worth and you stay naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes, also on the beach, seem to be some treasures hidden.
I hope that even though, as my son said, this historical moment isn't for any good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach, to rethink the use of time and ways to learn.
We also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
Today, physical works are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens, the education we dream of.
Thank you very much.
In fact, I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too two months.
Suddenly, we got used to living like this, that the doctors operated by telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in his X-rays warned and good nights.
The education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up in 7 aM during sleeping media.
I had the State workers to finally understand the work of Bubble Drail, for example, that mythomans and Chisms gathered in the diffusion of conspiranóid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy your boss, the pangsyers, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
And all commercials worked for dislivering and dreaming.
You could vote from home, but not only every four years, in the elections for president, every week you could vote from home.
It doesn't take any short or an abortion.
We interpreted a button.
He wrote in the book "Yes" or "Marig in the free "no".
We interpreted a button.
We all said what it seemed to us and then it always earned most of them.
One day for the other, quickly.
Please thinkers, nor theoretical deputies, deciding instead of people.
When I had the Church, it was also like that.
They gave them the curas on YouTube.
And of course, it was forbidden to emigrate them to Youton Kirls.
I had to have an algorithm supported to the lawyers and to the judges, and that from one day to the other, all those who had ever had rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
Not that we visited the world through Google Earctus.
And that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's negotiation and we had a line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I didn't know that when we saw a neighbor we would warn them from afar with the chest.
We had to become monogames, but really.
The lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood and started to coexist because the same thing we used to before or we felt loneliness.
I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
That they did addicts to something else.
So we had to see TED talks from home and do it home, and that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6.
I dreamed that the State would send us a 3D printer to each and buy imported products.
I dreamed that at night, in the big cities, stars would come back to see each other, they were doors like in the field.
And that in the field proliferated, all of a sudden, wild hair and lobes.
Then I dreamed that one day, many months later, the government announced the end of the pandemic.
A very short communicator, the president said to the people that it was possible to go out to the street, that it could be normal.
to come out of saying the president.
Join your jobs, leave your homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9th of July and that we all went out as crazy in the street and rushed the avestruz to make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting, we isolated it and killed it.
He gave him an intricate truck, he hanged against the snail of the struggle and fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And more people left their house, on the street, take selfies with the dead avestruz and steal wine.
There were shoutes and soon someone joined another.
And journalists appeared to spread live massacre.
And then, over sweat, I woke up and discovered that we followed in quarantine.
And I felt better.
I assume that when you see a photo, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a little more ugly in the picture.
There are people who are a little bit ugly in the picture and who seem lovely.
That fact has always caught my attention because if you think that photography exists, it means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't display it.
I started to draw actively.
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
What would I embrace the challenge of seeing with detachment, of indaging the etymology of the gesture?
The visual etymology of what we are capturing.
And from the idea that knowing helps you see what you have in front of you.
And it's when I go for a walk or visit in a place with little friends on Facebook that we draw.
We use them as a lab and we see that a line is a point that came out of the walk, that the eye is a very subtle lens and that in order to understand the invisible we have to look at with detail the visible.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds.
Ponco told me.
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or unite with a cream that remained in life.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went to Instagram director.
It created a lyrics by chance and I entered the first profile that appeared.
Why to what to what?
Why would there be everything that this person had published until the date?
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful women in number 18.
A lot of people back, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I knew I was a very friendly person.
For those publications there were some bench art pieces.
I said, "That's it, this girl likes art."
Something that later I could confirm with some photos she looked like painting.
All of this was going down and I discovered that who you are now, was your best friend before.
What is a trans girl who inherited school last year and who is now studying graphic design?
Meanwhile, I could also see what a healthy person is, who has to rent him and drink him, so he is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
My mom was very shocking.
I couldn't believe that I could know someone like that through social media.
And it's true that in networks each one chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
And even so I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have come for months.
To go from a general idea of that person, to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and after all that, make a general image of the person.
And understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
Generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans.
And that didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to choose to show it to her reality.
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helped me question myself what I'm seeing in the world.
I could make these species of challenge with my mother, I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like in which I spoke about taking care of the environment.
I also started to ask myself what am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like this, how am I going to do it?
He spoke to us with my mom and my very deserved me, invites me with a cream, we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds move to our day-to-day meetings.
It was then that I realized that this different way of getting to know others on social networks went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
My behavior in the real world, so to say it, changed completely.
And when I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing.
And, obviously, I ask him to use on the networks.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Just like the attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
Can you be aware of how your eyes move on in this image?
Do you know the first thing you see later?
You surely have all experienced, at some point, through your eyes, in different parts of your face, you will have stopped at some point.
Effectively, some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build the mouth corners, the beaches of their ears, they received the pores and details, were fundamental elements to build what we would call the portrait's view.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew which parts of the face were looking for.
The elaboration of a portrait is to highlight an subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she is looking for the other, the one in the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a popular positioning team in a neuroscience lab we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How to extract information since the rest constitutes the brain?
We made all the images, all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when creating the portrait and which one is not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
What we use was what I'm showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This brief trial for the journey of an eye, is somehow a strict of some projects carried together to Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think in a way as a trip, a trip through different landscapes, postumes and jokes in which we travel with some maps of art and various leaves of the field of science.
But, fundamentally, what encourages us is the search of this kindness, the questions, the expectation.
Thank you very much.

At the exact moment we are born, we start aging.
Aging is the flow of life, the most natural process of human beings.
However, it's the most resistant.
And we put so many resources into living more and more years and even so it seems it's a stage we don't want to reach.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me, "What are you so young?"
And it's my future that I answered.
Who am I living for many years and that's how I go?
They didn't say that moment, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this issue, it's fear.
Fear to be old.
First, fear of living in a society where the most important thing is to be or to be young.
The fear of my knowledge and my experience will lose value, that my word hasn't taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides, stereotypes linked to age are still socially accepted.
We can see in advertising, in labor search, in the jokes we make.
The worst thing is that many times we don't notice them or let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
We have some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
Only the data of the vessor of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-beatable.
That is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
This belief shared that the elderly are sad or depressed.
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people of my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label.
What's going on?
Who exactly seems to me that definition?
That doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating, they are doing sports, taking part in volunteers, taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social behaviors and institutions.
And if I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying out a super innovative project: Can you imagine someone like this?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Or even when it's proved that the projects where older people are involved are more likely to succeed.
However, I never found a scholarship, nor a calling, nor an opportunity for financialing that includes them.
For example, the empty that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country don't exist the matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults, not elderly.
Everything related to aging is just a theme in general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
What's going on with university teachers in any field.
Results are invited to be removed from age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach and at 71 or not?
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
That of the older person in a park, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
And the only thing we have in an archive was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to pictures, there are words missing: elderly, elderly, elderly, third and old, elderly, they are the workers, I still don't find a word that identifies or according to all.
The only one I suggest to avoid is a grandfather or a grandmother.
I think they are your grandchildren, of course.
(Laughter) Because of affection, some justify.
And if you are careful, you could say "my" because you're a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond.
The elderly have a name like everyone.
Stereotypes hurt, exclude and become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves or accept ourselves.
If we collapse, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, create employment, to design new products and services.
In this new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
I'll give you an example.
In this country, one out of three older people says they are recreation and entertainment needs, they are little or not satisfied.
I believe that if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However, business proposals and education that exist are considered almost exclusively for children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides, many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why, my proposal is to listen and learn from older people, their new possibilities, desires and tastes.
A while ago, I interviewed an older person, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be activities with people of their age or with younger people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
But being in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
My folks are us and we are going to do.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
