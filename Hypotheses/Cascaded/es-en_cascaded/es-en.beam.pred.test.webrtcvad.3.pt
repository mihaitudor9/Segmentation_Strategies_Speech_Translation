(Applause)
I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me give it.
It's very simple.
Do we need it?
Learn?
Do we feel it?
Think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
With that feeling of ungravable.
It is surrounded by a big biodiversity.
Therefore, from corals.
From turtles, molamous fish.
They are species of all colors.
I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
A mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a small fish.
You work.
Black and yellow people came out of a fish bank.
And it was put in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
I know what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he speaks to fish, right?
It's the same what my students think.
In college, every time I tell you about it.
Do you look at each other?
And they say, "Gee, the teacher is crazy."
But I'm not crazy.
And...
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
The work lasts 24 hours a week.
To draw.
This artwork that we're going to see.
Or the opposite?
The maritime current would take it, that sentence we see.
It is shown that nature has awareness.
And that I'm not crazy.
I'm able to talk to fish.
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds?
Or with plants.
Would you walk with the mountains and other natural phenomena?
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific proofs.
Last year, Ayans published a study where 1,200 intimate diverse ecosystems were analyzed.
Scientists.
They said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern.
It is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
According to the Cliver's law.
An elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
Having three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
The reality is what we live.
It's built of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my doctoral research.
That is to say.
All those sciences.
What do they integrate and unify?
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we should mimic and perfect.
To achieve a sustainable development and here you bring a summary.
(Laughter) And I remember as the scientific consensus, Cola Explosion of Big Times, the universe emerged 13,7 billion years ago.
The planet Earth was formed between 4.500.
I'm millions of years old.
And the miracle of life.
It has between 1800 and 3500 million years old.
During the first half of this period, the life forms of the Earth remained in very simple levels.
It was with the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere.
The first complex cells were originated.
Thank you very much.
There was the cosmic exclusion of the pregnant.
What is the biological variety that has increased at a great speed?
They are creating a wide range of multicellular organisms.
We are developing survival strategies.
Bruji, bucincular.
And the trophic chain.
The accident seems to indicate that life followed and the depths of the oceans.
He couldn't reach the land, sign up until 450 million years ago.
The disappearance of the dinosaurs from the legal period 66 million years ago.
This started the hegemonic period of mammals.
A bit later, the first or minimum pepper appears.
Thanks to fossil remains found up to echox, it is known that autolopites have about 4 million years.
The homorectus and the two million.
Or dental coins and homo sapiens.
It's 200,000 years old.
Currently, Homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species.
Ecoavit and co-evolves on the planet Earth.
Together with the rest of their rich biodiversity.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago and especially since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed.
It's like something unsustainable.
(Sigh)
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species?
A single species, an itan more?
It is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of species.
And that is to be crazy.
All of us are responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs.
But human beings continue.
They want to destroy everything around them.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
It seems that we have forgotten of irosymics and Nacasaki.
We've built the hydrogen pump, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear pump.
Why do you get an idea?
Following the thermal fusion of the stars.
That can reach 65 million degrees integrated.
And why if that was little?
The future generations.
Does anyone see themselves threatened?
With the big ecological footprint we left in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
From 1990 to 2020 it's been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Does anyone think about the world forum of nature?
All of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitating the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
To be in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of...
Fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have generated a huge global warming, what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the mutaches in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources.
They will be able to develop it in a dignity.
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
And although it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in all forms.
In life, in nature, what defines...
What defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation.
I'll give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Curring, fighting, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not the competition, but the symbolic union of having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between eleven players along with the technical body behind them.
Why the body?
Is it a pluricular organism?
Where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are.
Paradogically, nature is the best way of imitating it and perfecting to reach sustainable societies.
After 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time.
Has he suffered disasters?
glaciation, meteorites.
And several processes of trial and error.
But human beings continue to create a linear thinking ideology.
Strina is political, as narchism that failed communism, which also failed socialism.
capitalism has failed too.
A study from Oxford last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet -
It has more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick patologically and if cobalanced, because nature leads to economic benefit.
We have sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
Right?
My life, my great imitation, my life imitation.
But this is not new, it's already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside all of us, we all have that college.
And I invite you.
Make a game.
What is imagination?
What happens to this wire?
How could engineers, architects do?
The economists, let's be inspired.
Well, they had the idea of doing it.
A plane.
What would happen to their peak?
From the birds, Mart√≠n volador.
The Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites?
We could build bioclimatic buildings.
But this is Girasol.
A solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species.
In nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we continue.
Do we think about nature?
To be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase of GDP.
What does PIB mean?
Many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build them.
Why raising so much percent?
Economics every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in.
It's not a gift from our parents.
Without loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that's on our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
A future to dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
I would like her to tell me.
Papers.
At least you tried it, you fought.
Don't you think it's
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) What we have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity, and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's horrible things, we're going to do everything missing.
But it has many with complicated proposals, politically.
Economically, huh?
We move it wrong.
Usually, with good, let's extract our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do the perfect, and not about why thinking that it's an opportunity we have to take advantage and we're not losing it if we don't take advantage of it and that it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do I say that?
Life is not about something else, that goes through horrible moments and learning from them, we learn the pain of the disease.
Do we think of mistakes, of death?
We've always done it and we'll keep doing it.
No, no, not what.
We're going to do that now.
And what I didn't have, I just have to enter.
What is an idea I've been meditating from a book?
It's called modern nature, so cinema is right to the hormone.
It's the newspapers that have already brought me in the 80s.
When was they diagnosed with HIV?
So he decides to return to his patient from childhood to kindergarten, but that's not a filmmaker, which, in fact, later, I'm going to diagnose.
They are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the important spaces of their career.
But what he decides online is that he will buy a land instead of a horrible hospital?
And he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
Like the person: "Are you writing?"
For him, taking care of a garden wasn't meant to be time.
It wasn't.
Yes!
The time went by.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking, breading or loxing.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing is, what do we do if we look at it plate?"
And they are forbidden.
And I thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From Figengers, basically.
And that later I took particularly the feminist mark.
To talk about reproductive work, not even the productive work, the one that put new things in the world?
We could say, in other words, always on my radio, a cloud, it doesn't matter.
And this reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do that: cleaning, cooking, taking care, right?
Basically you.
To cook the workers so that the next day they would put the factory, their own productive work.
And feminine for a long time now.
Aluming correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
Now, why the edge of zero in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
What's more, why don't we do as an insult and think that this difference and contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work is a difference.
The most unhappy given by one side.
Of course, gender, for the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are traditional productive, performed by the aurorae.
And reproductive ones.
It brings it if you don't interview it because women are important.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject of the original, this can be monolars in the world in which the subject that sets.
Why not, take care of?
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an original, it doesn't make you an artist.
You become inverted, you don't make an important person.
Isn't it?
These are well-known values, we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We're living without wrists and writers.
In a lot of things, I was moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food.
And without care.
And without nurses?
And without health.
The only thing that is allowed us today.
How wrong?
Be careful.
What clean?
And without that, the world doesn't act.
So?
Is it your tasks?
They have a not relative value, it was an absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
They are not a mechanical thing that we necessarily have to go up there.
I wish there weren't enough, that hopefully one could do this, clean the thing and cook is not just seeing food.
It can't, how do we think like that? We've been thinking about it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Germans is that...
I also start living them differently.
Can we live them?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title wasn't modern nature, modernity, not like...
Human beings separated from the natural world.
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
but the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
The care relationship with our bodies, we think there's someone to take care of the body.
No, here the stage has to...
Coffinada.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, the things that matter.
She looked at me.
This is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
I think...
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, of course, I want to go back to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more soap operas, and I want to write soap opera, that's life.
No, we all live in this contradiction and it's life for the absurdity.
Now!
Of course, the world needs more soap operas.
I thought, "Well."
Why not?
Instead of being obsessed with being productive these days.
And knowing all the holes and all that, why not think?
to connect with the world, with the body, with care, with others, in a different way, from that.
That's why, when I was invited to do this, I almost said no, because I thought I didn't have an intension of an original idea, the world didn't have decided another novel and the world doesn't need another idea.
But that's why I thought we're going to write.
Bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I was...
I had my books and that might help other people, right?
More than writing it down.
What else to do?
Fourth.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat.
No more bread.
In sweet times, Namas Portres.
Just like that!
Good morning.
Have you happened?
Financial by means.
These foods don't get fat.
What wakes up is the unmeded way.
They are ordered ideas in which we consume them.
Do I want namebrals?
Do you have key aspects?
To have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
Once a teacher told me.
The issue of consciousness is high to brain activity.
And with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject.
I'm talking about our subconscious.
Our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take awareness is high to our desires...
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one who doesn't like the most.
And after that?
Are we aware of what we are feeding with, what are we eating?
And in which amount?
A good fact is not going to the super hungry.
Because when we are hungry, it's not hungry.
The hunger of everything is vorious and caloric hunger.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
He's always forbid it.
It has been the most tempting, right?
The one who diets, restricts, fast foods.
It's constantly thinking about pizzas.
From dream, hug, an escape with a double queso.
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
That is, pizza.
Thank you very much.
I'm talking about a hole.
What does it mean?
The second aspect is practice.
Do we eat it?
Like every process in life.
You learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
That my include represents itself.
We dare to learn how to eat in this station.
What does this mean?
To eat the food that was costed at that time.
I think it will guarantee a control.
an equilibrium in our weight and putting a god in our health.
Because foods were properly expelled at its time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or is it normal to see frutils all year long, or it's normal to see tomatoes?
In winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee a quality consumption.
And a variety.
Where we are not going to fall in the monotony of eating always the same.
The last aspect?
It's one that for me is one.
It's not small, but it's one of the most important.
In the moderation.
To those who don't break.
Because they are not hungry, because they don't have time.
Because many times they give usories.
I have a question.
OK?
Are they scared?
Repeting the mattress dish with cold?
To think, right?
So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
That hunger is not variable.
I don't know if they stay comedy if they eat.
What wasn't consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night, and in double split.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volume.
And increasingly with more strength.
So, if we don't stop.
Each three.
Four hours.
To take a swing.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace way.
In the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash all the food that we have around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unfold the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating.
The more flaws I'll be, the more weight I'll lose.
And no.
The most experienced body becomes in reserve.
Sguarding.
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, I mean this.
There's still not everything we want to eliminate.
From our bodies.
Food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave for this ignorance.
Food can hurt you or can cure you.
It depends on us.
Do we have to be aware of what we are feeding and what amount?
I'll go back.
It's the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation.
Would one should exist?
It starts with moderation.
Salt to food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure.
I propose you to eat rich.
To eat everything you like.
How can you eat variable?
To always take care of the portion.
Nothing, there is the phrase of "Sayuna como rey."
Along as a prince and dinner as a begging.
I think many.
We know it.
health doesn't have excuses, "Oh, I can't, I don't have it there."
There it is.
I'm hungry or worse.
Sometimes she died of hunger.
We have four opportunities every day.
To choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthily.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A while ago I've been obsessed with stories of female scientists.
I love it, the first time Marie Curie came to me.
They didn't give her a Nobel Prize, they were two.
So it deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things.
Recently, I learned about Eugenia's story to be a dote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
He made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one who brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s.
Thank you.
thousands of lives were saved.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And you know what?
It died in 2011 when I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
How did I lose it? They didn't give me an idea to the anger that gave me to know about it very recently, a lot of anger?
That's why I tell stories of female scientists.
To honor those who went.
But, above all, to not lose those who are.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
We lost a long time at school learning ortography.
Well, the kids keep going for a long time.
I start at school with ortography.
Geography, that's why.
I want to share with you a question: Is it necessary?
And every new ortography, I think yes.
That we need or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question nor the answer are new in our language, is revolving from the century to the century for a long time.
No, since in 1400.
92 in the first grammar.
From the Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography, a clear principle.
It's simple, so we have to describe how we pronounce and tell how it works.
Everyone, to each sound, had to correspond a letter.
Each lyrics should reprimate.
It was just a sound and those that didn't represent.
But no, they had to get rid of it.
(Laughter) This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, it's and it's not.
Do you know the basis of ortography how we practice it today?
Yes, why is he there?
Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French.
So, he always had a strong resistance to write too different from how we pronounce, but not this, because when in the 18th century he decided how we would uniform our writing, there was another criteria that guided us.
(Music) (Applause) Before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around the delirium.
And say to myself, "Me too."
I didn't hide from those eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and death.
Maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry.
I felt the need to look at their asts in the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
The whole universe inside my mind.
That is, it was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy.
It became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
This is the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And there's another one.
It's the brother of another and that's how I could teach you infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death is more than an end.
It represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life.
This is a project.
For me, this teaches me.
That our pureest material essence.
We are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror.
There's perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
In Argentina.
The INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is spatial.
Their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
From the ability that the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A building of education?
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
That I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with pedagogies.
Digners, data scientists, artists, philosophers.
Teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logic.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
A mixture?
From innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's to think of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all adds.
Just like that, changes in education.
You won't benefit the most advanced (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm a neuroscientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From bigamorphoses.
extraterrestrial inventions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home.
We stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners, human condition.
Even the most ridiculous and the worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
It has an unconscious logic.
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than the answer.
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy it.
It's also very unique to human beings trying to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, Chinese Government in only 10 days.
Not only did they find the virus that produced the disease, but they had sequenced their genome and made it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us.
And not to be on the other start of Mayan psychology.
It's called "the optimistic bias."
The same here makes many of us handle or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages.
thinking that in reality nothing will happen to us.
It made the major politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen now?
To us.
Unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmas.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, with the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks.
They are useful for avoiding people who are already ill with others.
However, in Japan we have to say that everyone uses more chairs.
The first thing makes people sick and don't know, don't tell them that this is very important.
But there's another reason, maybe more important, that if you use more stairs we get sick.
So this would be a kind of acusatory excuse.
Knowing who's sick and not because of whether they wear or not cards.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid the estimation and this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think -
That we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that we really need motivation to do something.
We've discovered this now for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change them.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
We don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the premature need.
And the world keeps moving.
But also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes for their predisposition to limit individual liberties.
To confine people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority to us.
And if on this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to be a little mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization.
But also governments and other public sectors.
It has the capacity through some technology to know where we are, where we move, who we find.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our viral load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this council can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
The one in your child, if they stay home, the one that's not at risk can come out.
And we keep on this mental experiment.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but there are fewer people die and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in a way that emotions die.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, which were a bad use of them.
It's still true.
Today, nothing is free.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
That you could choose if you feel good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
I found, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom.
That are fundamental values, pillars in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions...
They are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Who are you?
We can see our data in a bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom.
We found a good solution for commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free?
Several.
Are they going to fly less avions in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we also realize that we can also take part of our data as a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know it, but locked up at home -
Do we have an opportunity to think more freely than ever?
What do we want it to be the compreservative sex of coronavirus?
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old on a trip.
What we did with my family, the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagone, in Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
I saw a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this one, as we call it a mind.
Dolars of sea.
They are relatives of sea wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment ...
I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossil that I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile.
The sea dollar was broken, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
But...
I'm interested in fossils, or fascination for those beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been.
In the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me.
To study.
Sinosaurios and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist.
but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you 100 million years of reaction.
What is a number we paleontologists?
And we mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, it's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
It's a quantity of time that is really very, very difficult to give us.
In the head.
But well, life has led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I have traveled.
Effects and fossil studies from all over the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa.
Studying fantastic fossils, but...
It has also led me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagonia?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally.
We thought of a little forest landscapes, the lake, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a wonderful and full of fossils.
What are left to be discovered?
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world.
to look for dinosaurs.
And most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are of the last period.
What did dinosaurs live on Earth?
What we call the creptic period.
This is about 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The most common carnivores belonged to a family called Velis√°urios.
While for that time, in the northern hemisphere...
They added other families of carnivores, like for example, accidents.
Where does the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belong?
And this difference between the North of South was not...
It's surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the North Hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well?
In what we call "the legal period."
About 100 million years before.
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea.
And we know very little.
What happened at this time, in the jury?
In the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her key meat, especially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time.
They completely denied the planet.
For the first time, they achieved gigantic size for the first time.
They differentiated and conquered the niches of herbivores, of carnivores, of omnivores everywhere.
The planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships.
Let's explore the rocks of the Patagone Law.
And that leads me to one of the stories, to the discoveries we were able to do.
In the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon?
After walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
He saw him becoming more clearly what he was.
It was the path where it hurt us.
And I got closer.
I sat by the side, I shooled.
I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and at the same time I knew it was, after studying years.
of bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew exactly what the trash part was.
I left a meat dinosaur now.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
Did you know it was one of those discoveries that happen?
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count on the team or time, it had to look like a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
Until the next season given from winter.
It was a long year of waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
And to see if there was something else, it was only the skate we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
From the station.
We realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was there.
Very good.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal had died.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way.
He was skeleton.
And that's where the excavation really begins: to throw it away, layer, those sediments that were burning.
A dinosaur is a very exciting moment, for the first time it's...
Going back to the surface.
An animal?
I was living in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The cinema had to have died, it had to be covered by sediment strings that kept accumulating until gathering.
Metros and feet.
After following layers, and that food was transformed into sedentary rocks.
In that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Afterwards, all that buried rocket had to rise up to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and some warming.
All this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosing these layers, layers, layer, until starting to discover.
The layers contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking from those hills.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to have happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very...
Emotional.
To discover jueces is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The pathologic wind, that doesn't lose.
And then we could carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab to the museum it starts another very long stage, where technicians, with an infinite patience.
They are removing grain to the grain.
All rocks that cover the bones of ...
These dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur called Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw.
It was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of birds, those.
Carnebs of the southern hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
That's what we thought.
Much before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they separate themselves, being due to a big ocean, at the time of fire, when all the continents were united in a supercontinent supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have between hands until we get there.
For example, from some rocks like these that we carry to the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside.
Nine months of work in the lab.
We went to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those rock blogs.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "manidance."
Now this dinosaur is very special, in addition.
For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replica of this dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, wouldn't take more than 50 feelings from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur mining didn't look like any other way.
What did we contract or knew of the northern hemisphere?
Studying their remains we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other at this time of Pangea.
It's still not formed of the Atlantic Ocean that is used today to these two continents.
No, but once again we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work with other animals who live in this time in fossil plant that have been found in this region.
And also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us.
Of the environments of this time.
According to climate models, what we saw is that at this moment in Pangea, where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic.
The existence of a big one was dubbed.
In the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great guy who had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the faines of the North Hemisphere.
It was the lack of water.
What I had isolated these vaccines was not a desert full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs ...
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are going to tell us that they are really fantastic, fansfascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is, the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this one, in the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in rocks that are formulated for millions of years in our planet.
Thinking more and more.
To animals.
And the plants that lived in the past.
And while they graduated.
The Earth is a big book.
It's a huge amount of websites.
Scrites over 4500 million years.
And life.
I listen to a prepondering place.
In the last 3800 million years.
There were millions of pages still to read this book.
What if we really want?
To know our planet, its poems, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays.
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
And what about it?
It's also key.
To project a future.
What happens?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Audience: Yes!
(Applause)
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid ...
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dreamed of healing.
To find magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors.
So time.
It gives us a real bathroom.
You stop the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Larry Potter.
They saw empires invading small villages.
And you don't have the choice of standards to defend them.
But something like a child's vocation...
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you.
It's six ideas.
To develop?
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe?
It's the most important thing in this situation.
So, to live.
What is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas.
You won't learn from others.
And this is it.
The main part of all ideas, something like the zero idea of this I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be developed.
Pooling our mind with...
Ideas powerful.
and practicing.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
Papers of these rings, fixed bikes.
Do you get half-turn?
They go to the bar, ask for coffee with milk, with three months of student from Manteque and they eat them.
They don't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same.
It doesn't count to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
To develop in ourselves the habit.
You can think.
And we give the time to think.
Intelligence is not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
The second one.
Have I done the saying?
Who only sees a king?
Who only has a bottle?
I see all the problems as a slap.
But if we have to pull a ring, a ring is not good for us.
Not taking into account of his slap.
That we have a ring, we need a mediating disaster.
And if we need to cut something, we need a bad being.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools of mind are called "Mental Mental Memen".
And we only have a mental model.
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get a torn with a black being.
If we have many mental models.
Our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models come from, where do we get them from?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box.
With tools in mind.
Isn't it?
All the problems will be worried to us.
It's the third one.
Recently, I was at the club and at the table on the side.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
For a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends and because he had told him something.
I am alone.
He didn't realize it.
Of what?
When I say this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
Is it Swiss?
He ended up letting him like a tone in front of his friends.
And he was detegitiming the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to learn from him.
Many times we don't realize it.
We must be focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it.
We do things that make us lose in other most important scales.
To have a discussion.
And lose friendship, for example.
The flour and sorry freedom.
Or winning freedom and losing love.
When we act, let's think about what scale it impacts.
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think.
How to act?
And the fourth?
The beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And pressure generates emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
As many data arrived in China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
They generated emotions.
And they didn't make us act.
When they got there...
Imagine Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those expressions generated emotion.
Fear.
And fear generates action.
That we are all stored preventively what is very good.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because something similar happened before us.
But many times...
It's important to act when we don't see or feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from the modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Casting is one thing."
Do you feel hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward.
who eat what you married.
But cultivating is very different.
Do the effort now.
It's for something you're going to take advantage of within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
And preventing generates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
Because nobody is random.
But it saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is, to develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now?
Why still?
We feel, we live.
Of whom?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we thought it would last six months.
We're happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last.
The month is sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
If we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But a key for resilience.
It's to handle the expectations well.
The sixth investment.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a strange place?
You're walking through a little town in the middle of nowhere.
A high school classmate who wouldn't do it 15 years ago.
You can't believe in a coincidence how unlikely it was found in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely.
It's to find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same.
Are there so many unlikable things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
As you think that the unlikely is impossible.
And it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now nor with more formal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was the best, the intelligent way of coexisting when the right man.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
Of serious things.
Although they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals.
Why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
with a high school classmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning I thought about zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being hugged.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
And for people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
We could be people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's the attempt to change our own ideas.
An interview Borges 40 years ago.
The interviewer is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interview asked me, "That's it, he answered to me."
This same question four years ago.
Morocas.
I don't know what has fallen.
He looked at him.
And he told her.
I apologize.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be in account of new ideas.
From the new ideas that are emerging.
To be always open.
To change our way of thinking.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the cost of a man.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives.
They will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
From a manual?
For the education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 19:30s.
But the idea itself.
It has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, at all times.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
In 2015, I mean today, six 100 years later, 65 countries.
They are governed by women.
In 1910 ... (Applause)
In 1910 Marie Curie.
The Nobel Prize was won, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Applause) But...
The French science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here had already finished elementary school.
The university, Harvard, has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, a woman is celebrating that, let a woman be the master's.
Yale University admired women just in 1972.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
This was it.
This idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
And there?
Help your husband.
which is an irrational being.
What a cisterica!
It was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them taking 5,000, maybe.
They thought this idea.
It was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing.
A conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, is a revolution that all revolutions...
Politics that we have lived through economics, if you are nothing next to this.
We're putting aside the idea that truth is true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody.
Not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world...
That there is outside, we can once understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe.
That interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
that interpretation is subjective, interpretations.
They are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretive framework?
What is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
Well, we're convinced it's on September 24th, because all of us here agrees with the Greek calendar, but if we had in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendaries, or more they exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think: Happy!
We are part of a very strong social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
Cats live without calendaries.
My dog, chiap, an archator, and who is this world alone at home?
No, causing some illness.
I didn't know the time, I didn't know what time had come back.
He doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
She looked at a apple falling.
He wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
If the trips were missing, to know the animals he saw.
Everything that had been accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
And...
To discuss the investigations that have accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
The birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born.
But if it was born, it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the task of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we're thinking now.
This is what we see in LAS.
Scientific movements, technological innovation that are becoming increasing.
More developed, thanks to this new paradigm that facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
The revolutionary change.
How did we see it?
For thousands of years women went.
Those who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
Half of the scientists today in the world are women. Half of the university professors are women. Look all the creative energy that humanity has lost to think of the way women were not useful for anything else than to clean pairs.
How many medicines lost in humanity?
How much intelligence?
How much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monstrous.
There's an idea we can.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that copy was created to study this process.
which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You'll say.
But how in the Greeks, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things, and yes, relationships between...
People of the same sex, peppers, women or any other, transgenere, that can imagine today.
They always existed, in every culture, at every time.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But he had never thought about it.
That the sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined...
How was a person?
Totally, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent.
It was the moment of the A generation.
Moral V√≠ctoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You'll do it guilty, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to blame you, it's not true, it's a big social control.
(Applause)
You don't say.
The woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
No, that's it.
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it.
And then, that is a terrible social control form because it dominates us.
Obviously?
On the one hand, they know we can't leave, it's as if they were deprived of eating.
We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world.
They don't have the right to talk, nor the right to stand up, the same as women before.
No, or the Jews, or the blacks without leaving the slavery, we don't even speak when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews.
None of the situations today is ideal.
We all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
50 years ago, 20 years ago, the homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to even donate blood, this is just up now.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
Cera E.A.
Usilated.
But in many parts of the world today they are completely legal. This was possible for paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc.
All oppressed.
They added their identity.
They respect each other and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have a full right.
(Laughter) But there's a drama of social struggles and you have to get into jail that discriminated me.
To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To be respected as a woman, I have to be just a woman, as black, just black and the same as only gay.
And the gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people.
Maybe I don't want to cost as a guy.
This is the change.
Isn't it?
However, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
From prisons.
(Applause)
What 50 years ago?
Look how old I am.
To make a homosexual child.
I didn't know what it was to be a homosexual child.
It's more.
I didn't know the word homosexual and they didn't even say to me, "My schoolmate told me, "Sure, we're going to hit you." (Laughter) "Sure, don't look at me."
I didn't even know what it was to be a trophy, nor dumb, or homosexual, or anything.
And at the same time.
I knew that caused rejection, that was something I had in me.
I didn't know it was.
I went back home, from school.
And I saw that my father, who loved it.
He looked at me.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so bad for it to come out like this?
What was that?
I had to learn that it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To adjust the identity there is.
What was the positive side?
I learned to make me respect.
I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black people too, would have learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, do everything better than the others, not to give me a reward, a charge.
Or they would applaud me, but simply for not to reject me.
I had to...
It's forced me a lot and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got into a terrible prison, which was to make 24 hours out there.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With translator, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual.
We are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also good at someone and say I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity.
20 or 30 years ago this idea had been having.
That it comes from understanding that there are no facts that exist ...
Yes!
(Laughter) (Applause) There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it: we are contradictory, there are no facts, there are contradictions and contradictions are also interpretations.
There are no facts.
There are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume staying there to defend myself.
"I want to go out," I said.
And when I faced it ...
When an idea comes to mind is that it doesn't move, while we only have it in our heads it doesn't serve us.
Have I made her body?
I left prison.
And I left prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Audience: Yes!
(Music) (Music)
(Applause) There's a awakening.
They didn't tell me.
It's a list of things we need to survive.
It's called "the one that's not basic."
The idea war: to live constantly with this rough.
To Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
But it contains the things we need to survive.
If I had the things we need.
But now it's something difficult.
It's not a narrator.
At every moment, person and place are completely different.
The constant movement leads us extraordinary situations.
It's a moment.
However, or little.
It was full of compassion.
where a storm stays and everything you know disappears.
And when all I did, I shut down by someone else's voices.
Your voice, I'm not in a microphone.
To double the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstacles.
But once you say it.
Once you can get rid of your words.
It's an avalanche of ideas that come to you at all speed.
Each of these ideas looks like a bomb.
They try to exterminate them.
But some of these ideas.
Good afternoon everyone.
Everything is choosing.
You should have your paraguas and cover them.
I can do one side and in part with each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy.
Afterwards, back, jump, run, run.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not bad.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs.
And even though life controls music, I believe the movements.
Designs that take us to moments.
Like a chain.
Moments in which you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
In a notebook.
Remember that you probably don't get an artwork.
But they will allow you to revive the exact way in which these stars are seen.
The formula I saw that face when I spoke about what I liked the most, the speed was the one that went to your heart.
Or how do you break when you spoke?
It's to you.
That voice that you so much know.
He knows that I'm probably looking for something you lost.
That voice.
Your best friend.
The truth is there is always one.
But it will be the first to stand up, the first to give you is a little bit to leave that sea of possibilities.
And at the same time, the first one is in that shore, in that list to get out of you when I need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a couple of crops, a notebook, a dance class and a better friend.
Without that, without that, it's a mechanism, I can't survive.
(Applause)
(Music ends) (End of music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Video ends) Who taught you to swim?
(Applause) (Music)
What we grew up in girls cities.
I'm sure that we once chose.
I have the opportunity to get out.
Great, nothing to be!
It was a bit like that, I went to the hospital.
I can't progress in the way I would like to.
That's it!
There it is.
They always appear onstage.
A person you'll see has already been in years.
Change.
And with a lady, remember her experience, she would have a technique.
And they come to remember that all the past was better.
Is this really the case?
Or maybe?
We don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
When we think about this.
Unfortunately, I remember my friends all my life.
Juancho, white and Emanuel.
These photos you're seeing there.
It's from 2009 when I live in high school.
What can I say to my friends?
And it was a lot.
They are like my brothers.
And they are three people super capable.
that as they didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like to be able to study what they liked.
They stayed here in the city.
And be surprised, until today.
You can't get a job that allows you to fulfill your dreams.
As for me, I'm the fourth in this photo.
The mark of the absence of opportunities was also present.
My parents, who are workers.
They made an effort on human beings that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that my fears knew that if they stayed here in the city...
I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be with opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
Designs in the middle, I'm still among one.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress ...
It's because of a speed that surprise us all.
And it collapse the borders and the barriers that insist on people.
In this context?
Cities to make more and more important tales.
Let's go to the sincere, they are our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68 percent of the world's population will live in a city.
As if that number doesn't sound.
But it should be almost aware of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more people choose to live in cities...
That is to say, where we have a greater chance to progress.
What explains in two senses?
(Laughter) While weapons seem to stay in time.
Others make progress, they're vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
Here I'm going to tell you a key word, that you want you to be engraved here.
When you leave there with that door, you go back home.
What is this?
Strange.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities for people.
We need to go out strategically to the world.
Part of my concern.
As a professional future in the field of international relationships.
That's exactly what happens.
To connect cities.
With the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminated manner.
If we don't pay our strengths, our potentialities, huh?
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you may ask: How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through the project "Concretos."
What is the quality of life of the population?
And they avoid migration towards other places searching for a better future.
I remember once again, inevitably, of my friends.
This is a photo a few months ago.
And so, you can notice a couple of things.
Or start?
Suming a fifth, for me, the girlfriend is the group.
Do you know what it is?
It was drinking something from the castle.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of investment relationship is given.
As they improve the quality of the photos of the phones.
What we were in it, we were going to improve.
Does any of them have a couple of jokes?
And we have to be better fights, but...
Do you know what we share until today?
Beyond the deep time that we have students with us?
The sheet shows the false opportunities.
Do I have a white man?
For example, who is also right in this photo.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2002.
"Stand up!"
Fractional!
But nowadays, even if you want to dedicate it, they had geography teachers.
It doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday.
Working.
They can just come!
Then...
Is it OK?
He's the one in my strongest left, who was just there his birthday.
How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces of our country?
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, since then we are changing career without being able to find what he was really passionate about.
And I can't even get a job that allows the seven economic independences.
Finally, it's Manuel.
It's a computer genius, but genius don't know anything.
Do you tell it?
Everything, every day working in his place that built from nothing itself.
What a university, I studied programming.
And she can't develop her potential if she believes in what she likes.
Because they can't learn necessary tools.
For lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
And the worst of all this I'm telling you.
Why?
We, as young people.
Do we have it?
Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
Right?
Recently in English, I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of eight liquid cars worldwide.
To participate in a weekend in New Dere and the capital of India.
I traveled in Argentina representation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
And...
Besides saying it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot.
But yes, two things I would like to share with you today.
They are accidents.
In my one?
There are millions.
What?
In fact, I will never be able to say it with sufficiently emphasis for you.
You can't understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
For all tastes and colors.
First of all.
You have to be willing to find them.
They don't come alone.
And none of them.
But not less important.
In our human resources, as Argentines.
They are brilliant.
We don't have any envy nor young people in the US.
Neither the Chinese.
It's great!
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
What do you have?
And a state that is there to come out to the world and bring opportunities to them to act to develop themselves.
Once again.
We create better cities.
We act strategically to the world.
Remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, I found myself to go to study.
With three days to turn 18.
It was an e-mail!
But it has a result, with a lot of fear.
Can't this ever tell it in public?
Because it's very difficult, but all surrounding me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to have a city.
Good afternoon!
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Why is this?
I have to go to taste.
Who's from my friends?
And nobody you know?
It's necessary to give them tools to our youth.
so that they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
Is it coming, calm?
Who's more beautiful?
Taking wings to the city that comes to you.
And with a strategy we can do.
Imagine how brilliant.
What would have been blank?
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Right?
And if today they were in one of the security forces in our country.
Or to laugh so far, Emanuel.
If I had the necessary programs to keep on accessing what they like.
Is it true?
Thank you!
That's it?
You see the lack of opportunities.
Thank you!
All of this.
And I decided to tell it.
But it seems a sufficient argument.
Do you want another example?
Look at the good.
This one!
It's the tattoo.
She tells me when, finally.
That's it, right?
Depression increases.
In which I fell, I'll have to go to university.
Right?
Two intentions of suicide.
in countless.
Psychological Schools?
It took me.
Thank you very much.
If we want these things to stop going?
We have to be strategic through the brain.
Why?
We don't eat a final point in our cities.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm a surgeon.
Since always, the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work ...
We have to look for it.
More reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years?
My research ...
In my case, in the sofa ...
It was based on it.
In searching for the reasons.
To operate.
increasingly less patients.
That's it.
We can do it in several ways, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases like cancer and not have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
Of course not alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
What does this mean?
We do it.
With biological platforms.
They are like maps.
We give them to the tissue.
To use their own ability.
to be restored after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
robotics.
It's giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What happened before -
It seemed like science fiction.
Today it is.
Almost daily, that's how it is.
Nonsense.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients.
That they avoided ...
To have to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
Do I have each time?
More work.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'd like to share a reflection.
About what can mean a collective culture.
At a moment like this.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese.
And in my work for many years I've had contact with questions.
Literary.
They are sociological and anthropological of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors.
And answers.
Social and individuals.
Of the Japanese society.
They can serve us.
When we face a crisis like this.
It's going to ask us a first question.
Why could Japan avoid the greatest impact of the contagium?
If it was in January, the first case went on.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
Tening the population of the third age.
Guys.
What about the world?
Going back to the second country with more smokers.
For the number of inhabitants.
So in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth.
but a significant advance.
And the identified one.
Until now.
We know this new virus runs a very contagious virus.
In these theoretical data, Japan introduced us a cocoter that would enable a great propagation of the disease.
Basically.
A lot of people.
In little place.
And a fourth of those people.
With more than 65.
A process passes.
Japanese is a society.
Education in a certain way.
that responds organic and united way.
In front of any event that compromises her.
Japan went through war.
What forests!
His name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, after generation, has had to support disasters.
Naturally.
It is generated by man.
We can think of this.
With something that likes Argentines a lot.
"Thappiness and soccer."
How an example?
What team of soccer will have better performances in a critical moment?
It's the team that train every day.
Everyone knows what infrastructure has in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure.
And he has to go out to improvise.
The directives.
I'm social distancing.
And it's full, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or in its own home.
The Japanese population has not established for hundreds of years ago.
You don't need to say "no to embrace".
Don't give them bees.
Because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
That is to say, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public spaces use singers.
You don't need to recommend your shoes out.
When you enter home.
Because it's already customary.
We don't have to indicate not to sweat or stubborn on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies in the past few years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board when they feel reflected.
And not to protect yourselves.
If not to protect others.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close an experience.
They did two Western teachers.
In a school, in Japan.
You'll surely know the sillas' game.
You put music, chairs in a circle.
less than the number of participants.
And they are taking one out of one.
In each round.
This experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves E.
The company is this way of being.
In other words, it's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me, in resonance, to consent that we do.
When we take care of others.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works.
(Sigh) Do you help yourself?
Because every immigration contributes to the good of everyone.
(Applause)
