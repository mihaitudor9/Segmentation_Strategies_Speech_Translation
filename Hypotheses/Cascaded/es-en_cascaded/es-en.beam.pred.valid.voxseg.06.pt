Are we young?
Basically, in this problem, the smallest combination.
Let's see, at the moment or trajectory of rocks, distant rocks, and in music, of orchestra, we filled it with.
What does it avoid?
There it is!
But we had a vision.
To make the script and the instrument we go, the protagonist.
From our popular music.
For this, we change the way we play it, so it sounds like a folklore, to look at Ravilo and live.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
How many deaf people had my carbon?
That is, it's called by video, each one recorded their part.
That's how the other can play on it and that's how we shout the repertoire.
(Pre-recorded voice) Let's go with this evil.
What we like is what depends on me, about sacrifice.
No, it's a sick person.
And relatives are those who don't recover.
What are you seeing?
But he cried, right?
And they wake up at parties.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic, something that we dedicate to checking the contents of social networks and fighting misinformation, they were already seeing.
And not worrying about this new idea.
But during the pandemic, the flu.
In 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global supertraction, was much cheaper.
The pandemic, COVII9 is the first pandemic that lives with my approach.
What is that, what information?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called her, because she creates panic and anxiety of gender.
Disinformation is always dangerous, we know each other.
Because what can affect, because what can put in danger is our lives directly.
We don't have an idea at all.
To circulate these days of the amount of waste on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and, of course, a WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they may not agree with a virus.
And they suffer daily the viralization of content without verifying.
Four weeks ago with my team.
We lower it.
without rest.
S: Chequeando.
They are sidewalks, trickers, that circulate on this new disease, fake news.
I know we know and we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible.
(Pre-recorded voice) And sometimes they're fruits.
That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
Pinculated to COVID-19.
(Sigh) You can fit.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that counting cells will be even more prepared.
And they are more prepared that they can help to stop this balance of information that can on us.
The four categories are simple: The first one has to do?
(Video ends) With content linked to the origin of the disease.
Comparative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them from Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
And I didn't have any instructions.
If you see content linked to a theory that human beings created this virus, don't take it seriously, discarded it, there is no sun evidence.
The second category is related to how the virus contains and spreads.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there is no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Girls and jury are the most dangerous, it is the one that has to pay more attention.
To those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making garbage with hot water and salt or making vapor is virus to disappear from our body if we are infected, it's not true that the vaccine will heal us.
There is no Cuban flag that managed to generate it, and there is no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine, science works all the machine to find treatment and proper medications, but at the time it doesn't have a completely satisfactive response.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, or access to different measures to the opposite measures of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social isolation was dissolved, 15 days ago or a little more.
He runs through a failure of credit that said that quarantine starts at 3 p.m. that day, and obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that not only we'll have to be locked in our homes, but in communications.
Deinformation in general try to generate panic and anxiety. That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that comes from one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, like the world organization of health or health ministry, distrust.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
Why?
We're not good.
What's the doubt?
We're not comfortable.
So, when are we missing to do a thesis?
And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty, without all care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, it's not cheated.
Don't share it.
Let's replace comparison with doubts, so common.
(Laughter)
I don't share my doubts.
That is what we take care of them today.
If you receive a content.
A: Of someone.
As Egypt, I discovered that I failed fabrics with firness and care.
And if you share a content and then you realize that fake news don't street you.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day, while science needs time, science works intensely to get the cure and the void of evidence and information.
We have to be able, maybe like before tolerating that uncertainty.
I don't remember another moment in the modern era in which the answers were missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those empty with blue content, because we're not able to tolerate our ignorance, we'll be much worse than tolerating them.
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned that working is a means of other people's pain.
It doesn't make you a person, bitter, sad, the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, not as we wanted them to be, but to see a filagon in an act of reconciliation.
No, sorry.
Yes, of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to do a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear.
That is to say that they generate the near presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more on our omnipotenty, to be humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed when despite having done everything possible?
And the result is not what I expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
And finally I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, it's about relating and accompanying.
Cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate love and compassion, may tear.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Recently...
I was 40 years old.
So, after writing several novelas, I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for desire?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman, like me.
Do I have to decide good night, I'm a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves to say?
I had a lot to start my research.
about women's condition.
QD: It was already written on many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately half of humanity are men and the other half are women, half of humanity is manliness and the other half is feminity.
So, why?
So, does it ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
And I would have surprised myself.
And maybe it's angry.
At 40.
Well, I am enjoying it a lot.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time they are ignored.
AC: And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations different to a man.
It's enough to walk in the street, to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
who walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research by distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If not, they'll hide them.
And the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological.
Psychologists.
Tecnological.
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, the sky is everything.
In most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women are the other, they are the other.
Women.
FR: Second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity that is everything.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Excrued as blacks, excluded as Proletaries or Jews.
But among them there is a community, they say: "We identify ourselves."
And, however, women.
AC: They don't identify themselves easily.
PK: They don't say us.
In fact.
So, a white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name.
What about a black woman?
It's a funny woman.
What if you identified easily with a funny name?
What about a projectory?
Women are not a community.
Women?
Well, they don't say us.
Because they live disperse within the group of men.
Anything.
Aren?
(Laughter) It is very pleasant to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists.
(Whispering) They looked for theories in religion, in theology, in biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In discussion, it's philosophical.
Several men usually ask me, "You owe this because you're a woman."
Of course, as if for having ovaries and uterus and rule and hormones I would take away any objectivity.
As if they were writing their children.
You look at you!
AC: They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
Well, what I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them, sharing what I understood.
To share what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
And within all that I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
And I'm going to tell you something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Nature is that?
(Pre-recorded voice) The whole society does not say, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
Well, in other terms.
QD: You're not born a woman.
It's yoga to do it.
And I was quite privileged.
QD: When I published my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Well, therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
A complete, integrated individual.
It's integral.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Poceau.
To have children, devote yourself to creating them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
His feminity resembles to that.
AC: I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
Are we aware of it?
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
AC: With price.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman and every man.
(Laughter) And you have to decide.
But above all, what he wants, for his sexuality.
Above all that he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
What if you want or not to work?
With free choice.
FDB: Libre, will.
Well, I want to be aware of it.
That it is effort.
It has to be done together.
Between men and women.
So, what do I want is that we feel?
That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a whole society.
SV: Beautiful.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
FR: Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Laughter) To be honest, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the steel, which is a steam.
In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And at the end, he says: "And this slope these thoughts so they can give it?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote and operated in search for more than 100 years and we can take it as our own.
Also, right?
And now breathe, you surely have been breathing at home.
Because you know them, right?
(Laughter) Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
A couple of years ago.
So, a group of mine from my school went out to marry for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice.
And my mom, who didn't steal a parade from the time of the Funkon.
Well, he came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
I look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
Well, it's full of kids.
(Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, the same thing was understood, right?
This that for my mom was so surprising and unexpected, is something that is very natural to me today.
(Laughter) Talking about politics, saying what I think, going to get out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, genital chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all there are villains who oppress, who discriminated against the rest, who say they are more.
And there are teenagers, children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a dystopy, which is a futuristic, dark and unbearable world like the one of those books.
And we have to fight to change that.
And then, they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change in which we, young people, who are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
DB: Anywhere where you do a death bag.
There must be aarry, and, of course, there is also a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
In the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments or discuss political things.
(Laughter) Meanwhile, many people want to avoid these issues.
To not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
I know there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone in their political position is not the same as fighting for me because I am in mouth and a kid's voice, that at the end of the day, even if it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment, I'm going to discuss it.
And if I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization, I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her my own without shame.
And when I get a close relationship with someone, I think about these things.
Because he can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
And when many say: "Let's keep quiet."
I say, let's talk.
(Laughter) Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it gives us a lot of fear, because only talking can build our future and regulate our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see markets and political spaces in general not as dangerous, not as it scares, but as a space of personal and social growth of union and inspiration, and I hope there is always, but always, there is always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without a little surprise.
PK: It's full of kids.
Thank you very much.
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a cup like this to take water home?
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted?
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by climate action for water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life.
And if we wouldn't exist in it, in fact, human beings, we are composed of over 65 percent of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the main lakes, through the agriculture of our large companies and even our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not only about the appearance of diseases around the world, but also the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
There are 1,000 children every day.
It's according to the World Health Organization.
This means that if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Well, of that number of people, at least 60 million, are in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it is somehow paradoxical, since this continent counts 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize, going to the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries.
Almost 20 million people, that is, around 20 percent of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
Well, these are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth is in front of this situation.
This question is exactly what made four doctors of zarabota leave everything behind.
And we wanted the bags and we gathered again to bring drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America.
From Mexico?
Funding like this, you go to the project.
And now we go?
It's a piece of self-caravan, so we call the white female.
And, above all, we were charged with a tremendous desire to return to the world the luck that we have had, for having been born.
We launched.
During the way we were going to find them with rural communities and rural camps that rarely have water at home.
All of them could go to poths or editing rivers.
Well, to be able to see, but always with a problem.
(Laughter) The water has this pinea.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat: the bible, to orch it or buy it directly. As you have, it requires a huge waste of resources for people who practically don't have art.
There's money resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go pick up the fire and then avoid.
And we asked ourselves.
So, what can we do to help increase this problem?
Starting from the basis that we weren't experts in the matter, we put them hands to the work and after many weeks of research.
We found a system.
Understanding by membrals that adapted perfectly to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
And I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works almost like a body.
And contaminated water goes through the child.
And this contains all the largest particles than with a love molecule (Laughter) leaving getting crazy, clean water, retaining in 99% of all these substances so damaged about health.
What is this?
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately.
And also, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider it.
That alone continues the water weight to make it work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these filters in the lives of all these people.
A: Well, that's it.
We want to tell you a story: Leocruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream, which was to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny, both he, and all his populate, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by ethical stages around him.
To our move.
And Leo signed up in an English course.
Can't you imagine?
So, the illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
To fulfill, among other things, their dream.
And the truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
I mean, they will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now?
Thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when from Guatemán, Project, they've sold an idea, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
We had never been alone before leaving.
More than 400 people.
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign that was destined to 100 percent to the exclusive purchasing of the water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands.
Together we have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There are still a lot to do, millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis can be one of the risks of the biggest risks in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic force, which is not just us saying it.
So we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident, we have created many needs that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
Where have we seen?
As big embotellers, they were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, therefore they were completely taking their entire access to water.
What do you think, for example, that they're doing for those lands, the large oil producers, the large oil oil oil?
So that all of us can fill our vehicles' depth.
What they are doing is to contaminate.
It's to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there and it's amazing, they're making the communities move.
And in the future, this is what will likely cause, it disappears until its culture.
But it's really incredible and living it hasn't left us.
It has left us something that has opened.
Actually, it's something that really feels and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
And the world's world crisis.
That is, it's a reality.
That not only.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The water crisis is a reality that today, November 12, 2016.
And it is directly affecting us.
Everyone feels in this room.
But you don't need to go very far.
In California?
It was with a technological development world.
They are mutating people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
It was for several hours.
In Spain.
In Spain we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the shortage of water in the future.
But if we really want to make a change, are we really?
But we want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
Well, what we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
This small NGO that is trying to build forces in Guatemala to display these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Why don't we try to exercise a bit of pressure on governments, who they really can?
To make the life that these big companies say, that today, of course, they're not doing the right things.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck that we have to reach our homes.
Opening the glass of water.
And it always drops water, or it's not like that.
And let's go, please, to stop mourning this resource.
And we don't think so.
But...
Believe me, it's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
And we have to act, we have to raise awareness and act, and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
And so we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
There are many, many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
That's it!
It's our way of doing.
What is your mind?
How nice is it for here?
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making an commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources, and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
Audience: Yes!
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
I commit myself to you, and when we see the frequency it gets into our hearts, it's a thousand times higher, and you see that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than thought, the frequency of the tromagnetic thought, that I'm going to talk from the heart, if they open the heart, surely, we only receive one part, so it's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines in front of us to put ourselves in a context: How is society today? Raise your hand and tell me three or four answers, quick, stressed?
Revolved.
(Laughter) Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
An accident from Cadent, well, in my talks I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answers, you saw the answers you just gave, and then to another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy,
(Laughter) Those of you who cry happy, raise your hand.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
You who are, who we are, aren't the society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy, and if they've always told us more or less questions, they'd have told us in that line, lost, discouraged, dismoralized, then it's called the oriented minds to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing, everything that's wrong, everything that I sleep, if we're focused on the media, of information?
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids' diary and we tell them: look for good news, bad and neutral news, day's money, how good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashion, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby goes well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sport, complaint.
When they ask me how you are perfectly fine, it's soon that 7th of July 7 am, first we leave the weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something is wrong, we complain about absolutely everything. What is the heat 3 of black 3 in the afternoon? What happened to you?
DB: You don't complain about anything!
So, we've become a society that's funny.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, so it's a disaster, you see what this is, and this has to change, it has to change the country, the society, my wife, work, all the time we're complaining, so we transform ourselves into recramologists, and the maximum, or pinologists, and all achievements.
We wait for all of you and tell us, maybe you heard someone who says it.
I don't feel able to opt, but we have everything, I see it with my friends, there's a friend Fernando who goes to the shirt with him and I tell him, "I bump with no batteries in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries because he got up the soy?"
You understand that the tone is going down there, and you know, we leave everything, we opinate about economy, politics, and there's something even more worrying: we've started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain, we complain.
Why?
And we are immersive in opinion, what makes us have fallen in a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also had a charger for the doubts that there is not much load, but with our energy, we had it, we started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
In addition, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, the country to be fine, that the weather is not the case, because I was a little overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the ring, I wanted wonderful, and the ring says: "Yes, but tomorrow it is announced to rain."
This is how we are losing power, and there's something I want to focus on, besides being in this society, to leave this society over all our generations, that we have left before society in the moral crisis, that even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine, faced, breathed, but of course, we are making believe our children, that we don't have a future.
Not only do we stop this, but we make them believe this, how this phrase is represented: "You are the architects."
And what do you want to be in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, what can we do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
But if we believe in generations that well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived, leaving me, which was an hell.
So I looked for more knowledge, more knowledge, more abilities, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies.
The multiplying attitude and you know that every zero amount is zero, if you have the attitude you have in front of life, it's zero, that's a zero type.
If you have that negative attitude, that's a negative type, if you have a pessimistic guy, that's a pessimist guy, and if you have a merde attitude, that's a sort of merdity.
Sorry.
So I started to say, well, how or to get out of this attitude, and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed, I had a decision to change the attitude, that I had everything that happened to me, and I started to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I was going to do, who was looking for the changes I wanted to see.
And I left the victim's attitude all the time being justified, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
This square meter lives in the energy I want to vibrate and me, and you know what here, in this square meter, lives in a respectful world, that's why it goes with a shirt that says "I respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter, I started showing what I wanted to see, I started deciding to live in a different world because living the hell wasn't reminded, once I was going to solve and I told him, "Don't worry, three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was in hell and in paradise, I saw happiness exploit every day in my life.
There was also my lover, full of love, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision, where it marks everything I lack, not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
And if all the time we'll be waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate, think there are many ways to educate.
So you're already in the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things, and the protagonist of those people in change, is not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And you're with a group of nightmare, it's a nightmare, if you're with a group of failures, that's a group of infelices, that's an unhappy, if you start with your square meter to contagiate solidarity or yourself, you start to emit that energy, because what energy you emit your square meter, what's important is not what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco went to buy a kilo of side, one would give it, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Pascuas," and she tells me: "These people were born and I, the first one, made me happy and paid." "No, he tells me, what are you waiting?"
What are you emitting, your square meter that emits, what do you fit?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
Why?
Amone inconditional, what is emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you say, what you receive, this is like MMS, if you are in AM and you go from one AM point to the other side, you're going to listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody, and moreover, in FM, you have the long hours.
The frequency is that you want to listen, you can choose, but if you're in the DM, even if you leave from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning and I start to say, "The first match is playing against myself," "Well, I wake up, I don't get up, a wind with bad humour or comedy."
Yes!
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence, mediocreity, this difference, the path you take is a church since you wake up, those victims or protagonists, with humour or not with good humour, well predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack, people drive it for fear.
And my father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
A: Well.
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this Dalbis Foundation, Fronteras, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we were doing, last week we gathered veterans from war of Argentinians and British, a british board came, a burk, and who gathered with Argentine veterans and together gave a meeting message that nobody won, and they knew who to close the conference in my 12-year-old nephew.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
(Laughter) Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a second is born.
A place where I was in charge, I thought there were a lot of things missing, I invite you to see and I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the foundation for which I made on borders, was, in 2012, I went to Brasa with another lady and celebrate, no and celebrate, so I said, "What are you celebrating?"
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, with drinking water at home every week.
And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to drink water and celebrate it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
And do you know what the genius is in lamparadine all through the translator?
And they told me, "I have no idea."
So I'm going to explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me, everything excited and tells me.
And they gave me my hot water bathroom.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment, if all the time was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink, if I could give my bathroom, I would have to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
And it stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story I want to propose an exercise, all of you in this state that we are now.
The first step will have three steps in the exercise: I ask you to close your eyes to all, to close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never realize or thank us, like health, as the possibilities we have, like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room have been welcome or selected or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now, who express this gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding the strongest thing you can shout, doing what you want, express the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life if you feel it right now, from this moment, stand up and clap very hard.
(Applause) Who makes all those endings fighting?
With what we have, with what we receive.
(Applause) For the love of our loved ones, or the abundance in which we unite, for the things we don't realize.
For the protagonists we can be in our lives.
You can shout, you can add to the chair, you can do whatever you want.
We are in a society at a boring moment, very well, very well above.
(Applause) Well upwards, this is the gratitude we have to express for everything we have.
(Applause) Barba, Barba, loist... Yes!
(Applause) And what did I come from?
Keep there for a moment.
The longest path to go.
There are four pads when we moved from our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we realize, when we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, all we have, but a decision.
We managed to turn off the turn for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
And this we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Can you imagine the genius of Aradin's lamp?
So he asks him what you will start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much.
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music.
You know why, because music is already in us, since we are born in beats, in poths, in rhythms.
The sun comes out bad, my life.
Oh!
But music also lives in the pauses.
And it teaches us the art of listening in silence and being receptive, music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy.
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go all together and grow in community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
PK: So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
Ten?
Have you come?
It's not easy to face this way in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be, bullying, all those physical or verbal aggressions.
That usually occur in schools, that's why they're also known as school harassment.
It's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, social problems, however, it's been 5 or 10 years ago.
I think few of us had heard this word "bull".
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that's always happened, and, in fact, beyond the age we have, we have some experience with this kind of situations, that is, because we live it on our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues, our poor colleagues from then, in childhood, or simply because we prepare it, it was called "toming from point to someone to mock."
Now, that is bullying.
Well, but I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, you have similarities with what happens before, but it's not exactly the same. For several reasons, first, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least, it wasn't this bullying word.
It wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to accumulate laws to cure it or to punish it, of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was something more or less normal, right?
And some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that at that same time, that is to say, not recently, other school drames were considered much more serious than those fights, with no importance that occurred in recessions and hallways, I mean amounts, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now, on the contrary, they tend to do the opposite, bad grades and disciplinary repriments, it seems they are increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying involves a more and more central role.
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time, not on the one hand, these most traditional ones of school humiliations, which are punishments applied by an authority, as a teacher or a directive to the students who did something considered incorrect, something prohibited by regulations or something considered they shouldn't do.
It's like behaving bad or not studying, on the one hand, that's how we lose weight.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
They are school humiliation reasons.
Well, these are the scenarios.
And that the same students apply to each other.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
(Laughter) If this is actually happening, the question would be why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a big historical change.
It's a huge historical change that is worth it.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts.
There are various amounts, expulsions, bad grades.
So, what operates there is fault.
Sorry for having done something the same.
That is, something bad.
That is, fault is an internal, private emotion.
In other words, it refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each of us.
(Laughter) For having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect.
I know everyone think that's wrong.
He even cried.
(Laughter) I feel guilty because I did something bad.
Now, in the case of bullying.
And it's not the fault what's at stake, but another kind of emotion.
And be ashamed.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
(Laughter) It doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something wrong, something wrong.
So, in the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others, the others.
And the look of others, that judges me.
In an incorrect and just way, sometimes cruel.
Beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that exercise my cruel look.
So?
And it's a transformation, I think it's a transformation of balance, right?
We have to have more embarrassment than guilt, and I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of others.
What obviously was always important.
But lately, he has won a demeasurable weight, maybe uncomfortable.
And, above all, at the moment of playing, who is each and how much it goes?
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change, and of course, it's a very complex change, that's not the time it's been generating, it's been done for decades.
And it's finishing of consuming now, it's crystallizing now.
(Laughter) And I think one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
That's why it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us and designed it with Ident, the conviction that the inner life existed.
Or something essential?
But invisible to the eyes, it was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and real way that the vanish appearances.
So, those appearances.
In other words, it's not only seen as vine, but also false, so-called.
As a small detail, something without importance compared to the entertainment of the importance of personal image of physical appearance, academic treatments, esthetic treatments, all of this are values and beliefs that are still within us, but that we are abandoning them.
But it's not the guts, it's not that it's inside each one, but it's not the guts but something immaterial, such as the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increasingly believe less in that, and more in what others can see, because we show what we do, and according to this transformation that there's something inside eternal, an anti-subicted, that would be more true from acts and appearances.
Together with this, there appears a series of indices of transformations, and a infinity of symptoms of contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoo, to plastic surgeries of self-production, that are now everywhere, and that until some time are considered a bad taste, as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks of the Internet.
By going through the shows and bullying, but thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
Not because it seems that guilt, when intonestations and bad grades, are increasingly less serious, that is, fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
So, from two sides that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk.
That this alien look, doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance as well, that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying, when these donkeys or disseminations spread on social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what used to be privately was to limit the group of acquaintances or protected by the school walls or at home, all of a sudden, it is exposed to people's villages, we don't have to take refugees.
(Laughter) Not within oneself, nor in intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping to an island of a certain way, that there are more and less or less exist, at least not without Wi-Fi, which is the theme.
QD: So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we post with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) If all this is happening in fact this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do, too, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad, how do we solve it?
I think that both shame and embarrassment are mechanisms of social control, and the fact that guilt is losing a good part of the future now and that embarrassment is magnificating, that's not a good animal in itself, but it's something we have to have in mind, that is, a fact.
Because if we keep thinking that it means that things changed in fact, then if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before, and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far away, in that's what he wanted to tell.
I received her days, we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
GB: One of the people told me.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
But a doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I'm thinking a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn from this educational stage that we don't choose?
And I think that yes, we are learning some important things.
(Laughter) I would like to share three of those ideas that I walked around these days and that hopefully, one of those are good for us to keep thinking about education from here.
The first is that for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency of animals to test new ways of teaching.
Education innovation is something close to what's been talking about, but that up to now occur in isolation by separation.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance and in this process we are encouraging ourselves to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that we didn't need to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available, but that we had never had the urgency in periods in need to use.
See tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social networks, called media, whatever it gives us the result to keep teaching, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples of our tool box, and little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings, we have to adapt them so fast.
Even trying to have patience and do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
And we take the taste to try new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
(Video) Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons to tissue workshops.
Even people with vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, older people began to show how the compound was to make bank paperwork to people of their age.
And we are learning in community.
And the second reduction of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we took part in groups of teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn when and how.
Audience: Yes.
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own time.
(Laughter) Some study more at night, others start with the subjects that are more interested, others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to stop understanding something that doesn't come out, or to learn something new, that they wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on, because it makes us see that they are moments of autonomy, of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working peace.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them when we're very young.
organizing their time.
To manage tasks and all that requires to learn to learn.
And my last reflection is rather a question.
What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
Well, when boys and girls cannot go to school, it appears stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if it's happening these days, we realize how hard it is to be a good teacher.
And this pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between home.
PK: It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
DB: This is the one who has a calm place to study and the one who doesn't.
The one here has to ask and not.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home and those who don't.
The school, with all its difficulties, at least during only one leave, put those inequalities in parentsis and helps all boys and girls to be protected and with the opposite focus.
GB: And in the middle of time.
As an educator, I'm very concerned about how all this will follow and I also wonder what will be left of what we're learning in this fourth grade.
My feeling is...
They saw when they get bad marks and they stay at the naked beach.
Among everything that drags that tide, what it breaks, what it takes.
Well, also on the beach some treasures appeared hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
In this historical moment, it's not for the good ones, it helps us make our own treasures that we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
Let's raise the use of time and ways to learn and also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
But today physical works are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens.
It's the education we dream.
A: Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too long and that suddenly we got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers from their house.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because boys learned to be cyber-attacks, that mythomans and chisms were replaced in the spreading conspiranóid news through social media.
(Laughter) And that those who used to buy smokers, pedophiles, naive shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for dislivering and I dreamed that you could vote from home, opening yes or abortion, we appreciated a button, we all said what it looked like to us, and then I always won most of a day for others, without Senators, Nurses, or catalogical representatives, deciding instead of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also an online, the misses were given on YouTube curas, and of course it was forbidden to launch them on Youtube Kirds.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported to the lawyers and the judges and that, from one day to the other, all those who ever had the right to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google ERT, and that we would do the line in the street, automatically by taste, keeping a metre and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the dunge and that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing we hated before.
And I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day in important things, and that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
And in a very short communicated the president said to the people who had habits to something else, I dreamed that at night, in the big cities, the stars would come back, were dots like in the field, they would proliferate, suddenly, waving and lobos, or that it was possible to go out to the street.
That it could be normal, leave if the president, occupy their jobs, leave their homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9th of July and that we all went out as crazy in the street and rushed the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal and a circular truck hit the snake of the struggle and fly from the truck and killed it, tons of wine cards.
And that more people came out of their house.
To transmit the massacre live, to take selfies with the dead avestruz, and to steal wine, and there were shoutes, and soon, someone joined another and the journalists showed up that they regret the street and then overcome, I woke up.
(Laughter) And I discovered that we are still in quarantine.
And I felt better.
Maybe when you see a photo, sometimes there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly on the picture, or people who are a little nicer.
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
To rethink the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced the challenge of seeing with detachment, of indaging the etymology of the gesture, the visual stimulation of what you are capturing, and of the idea that knowing helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go, on a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
AD: And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
A few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds.
A little bit said to me!
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
And if I could get to know at least 10 things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or unite with a cremma that remained in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and went straight to Instagram, I wrote a lyrics by chance and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started up to Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I assumed I was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some bench pieces of art and I said, "This is it, until a girl likes art."
Something that later I could confirm with some photos she looked like painting.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
PK: What is a trans girl you're at school last year and who's currently studying graphic design?
And among all that I could also see what a healthy person is, who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so he is very respectful with the environment.
(Laughter) But when these ten things had happened 28 seconds, my mom was very shocking, I couldn't believe that I could meet someone like that from social networks, it's true that in social media everyone chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
AC: To go from a general idea of that person, to get to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first meet the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person, understanding this way what I see in my first impression.
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
So, an example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier to want to know it, I didn't play it for being a trans, that didn't work as a barrier to ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making this kind of challenge with my mother, I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like when I talked about taking care of the environment, and there I started to ask myself what I am saying to take care of the planet, if I really want to take care of it, and if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and eating my very deserved me, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and is present in my daily meetings.
And my behavior in the real world, to say so, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't search for a label to fit it, I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing, and obviously I ask your user in social networks, thank you very much.
And I would like you to pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
And what parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
With two eyes, in different parts of the face.
They talk about having somewhere.
Effectively, some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait.
Also, the nazal sacrifices, the mouth commissions, the borders of their ears, receiving the pores and details, were fundamental elements to form what we would call: the portrait's look.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
What is it?
And it was the faces side that the spectators searched.
The elaboration of a portrait is to highlight an subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada, and at the same time it is looking for the other, which is the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a team of positioning in a laboratory of neuroscience we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face to extract information since the rest constitutes the brain?
(Video ends) If we put all the images or all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when making the portrait and which not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
We built it was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This brief trial for the journey of an eye, is somehow a strict of some projects that led together Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think in a way as a trip, a trip through different landscapes, customs and languages in which we travel with some maps of art and various leaves of the field of science, but fundamentally it encourages us to search for establishness, questions, expectation.
Audience: Yes.
Well, at the exact moment.
Do you know what we are born?
We start to get old.
And aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
Do we invest so many resources in living more and more years?
And even so.
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
"Nobody wants to be good."
Why?
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me: "What are you so young?"
(Pre-recorded voice) It's my future that answered to her: Who are you living for many years and I'll go there?
What they didn't say at that time, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this topic.
And it's fear.
Fear to be old.
DB: No!
Meet to live in a society where the most important thing is.
Right?
Or seem young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They keep losing value.
What's my word?
And it hasn't been taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted. Can we see them?
In publicities, in labor searchs.
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
(Video) When the data of the vessor of social debt tells us that 70 percent of the elderly people in Argentina are self-valid, is that they can take care of themselves?
And to take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
You see that the oldest stantists or depressed.
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people in my age or even younger.
Or this passive class label.
The passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
(Laughter) Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a 65-year-old person?
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call, nor an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them: Why did every time they treat older people's theme use the same photo?
From the older person in a park bank, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
The press is gained, it has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults, third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
DB: Great!
It's old.
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everything.
It's the only one that suggests to avoid.
Is it grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
Why affection some of them justify?
But it's because of affection.
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
older people have a name.
Well, like everything.
What do you do with stereotypes?
And they hurt.
Shouching?
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
Are we now?
It was an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs.
And to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example, in this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment.
Or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
But, however.
Office and education proposals are considered almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
In these opportunities we can't detect them intuitively.
Because older people are very different.
And that doesn't respond to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Well, many of us still don't go through that time.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people?
To really understand what their new needs are?
And their new possibilities?
Girls and tastes.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
I was clear to myself if I wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people, and I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
