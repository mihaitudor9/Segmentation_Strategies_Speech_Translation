Well, of course.
I saw whales of orchets.
Are we filling it?
The one that avoids the Partiose.
We had a vision.
Let's do it!
But at check, the instrument we make.
Togonist.
To do this, we change.
So that you sound.
And that is power.
What did we have to learn to work in reality?
It's called by video, each one records their part.
That's how the other can play by themselves.
And that's how we make mistakes.
Let's go with this data.
Perfect.
(Applause) So we don't even have Marzophones.
It's the last frequency.
So I need it.
And relatives are those who don't recover.
What about it?
Do you cry it?
They wake up to see a stance.
But there's another thing that this pandemic comes to me.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to tying.
The content of social networks.
And how will we call this information?
During the pandemic, the flu.
In 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
But their consumption exceeds global level.
And at my time, besides.
The pandemic, COVID-19, is the first pandemic that lives with my anthemic.
What is that, what information?
To the WMS, the World Health Organization.
It defended it as a practice of spreading fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
He played with a wheelchair.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
We know it.
But when it comes to health issues, it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect.
What can lead is directly our life.
(Sigh) I don't know anything about an idea.
Of the amount of waste.
To circulate these days on Facebook, on Instagram.
And you, on Twitter.
And, of course, a WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they bet without a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
Four weeks ago with my team.
We lower it.
without rest.
I have fake news.
Diggers.
Do you see measures?
that circulate over this new disease.
I know what, we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this balance of information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they're frustrated.
(Laughter) That's why I think it's useful and that I tell you what we discovered, what we found.
All the contents.
In COVID-19.
Let's encourage.
Flasifying in four categories.
You'll be more prepared.
The other categories are simple: The first one has to do?
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Competative theories they say.
What?
A pioneering action of two Chinese scientists stole them in Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
If you see content.
Pinculated to a theory that humans believe this virus.
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category relates to how the virus contains and spreads.
who tried that the virus lived a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with just opening the window.
That's not the case.
There are no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Treatments and courts are the most dangerous, it's the one that has to pay more attention.
Those who have to force us to be more careful.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill the virus and making room with hot water and salt or making vapor the virus to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
That he managed to create it, and there is no Argentinian that has already discovered.
A student sailing.
Science works all machines.
To find adequate treatment and medicines.
Totally satisfactory.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, or access to different measures to the opposite measures of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day it was out.
The preventive and obligatory social isolation, like 15 days ago, or a little more, a failure of credit circulated that said that Whitentena started at 3 pm of that day.
And, obviously, it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And so?
It makes us fear.
Encerrated at our homes.
If not in communications.
Deinformation is in general.
They try to create panic.
And it scares us.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health Organization or the Ministry of Salud, unfortunate.
I want to tell you something else we learned.
When we laugh, they start.
To burn, cheat, label.
(Laughter)
We're not good.
No doubt.
We're not comfortable.
When we lack certainty.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
Or if you receive a content, it's not cheated.
Let's replace it.
I begin with doubts.
It's so common.
I don't compare.
For doubts.
That is taking care of our ego.
If you receive a content.
Of someone.
And discover what they do?
Manten jails.
How did he turn around?
Confirmation?
And with smell.
And if you did share a content.
And then you realize.
What fake?
Not having boxes.
Excuse me.
And when they act.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Digital pandemic tell us about infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day.
Science works intensely to get the cure.
Go!
And it needs time.
Hundreds.
There are evidence and information vaccines.
We have to know that this is not true.
To tolerate that uncertainty.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
That if we fill those empty with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
Let's be.
Much worse.
What has been tolerant?
I've been working for 23 years to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I understood what?
Working is a means of pain.
Of other people.
It doesn't make you an amerged person, nor sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And to be grateful?
For all you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe?
And in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle.
In an act.
about reconciliation?
Sorry.
of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that the sense of humor ...
It's a very powerful tool.
that allows you to do a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
insecurity.
And fear.
What do they generate?
The close presence of love.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty.
Being more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
And when despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more atterces than ours.
And that allows you to put it on.
Your own problem as perspective.
Finally.
I learned and I continue to learn.
That it's not just about healing.
Especially.
Is it about relating?
And to accompany.
Cultivate love and compassion.
They help confront suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Multivate.
Love and compassion.
You can lie down.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
Good afternoon, very little.
I was 40 years old.
After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more personal topics.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition.
It's my condition for women.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman, like me.
I have to decide good nights.
I'm a writer.
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
Well, I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
It was a topic already written in many articles.
Feminity is missing.
FR: Do feminity disappear?
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But...
In the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Approximately half of humanity are men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity.
Is manliness?
The other half.
Is feminity?
So, why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
They would have told me.
Who was going to write a book?
about women's condition.
I would have been surprised.
Are you angry?
At 40.
I am really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations.
A man.
It's enough to walk in the street, to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
What do you walk differently?
That they dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I liked my research.
By distancing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological issues.
Physiological?
Psychologists.
Technology.
No man had ever happened to him.
Analize the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
There's no case the shoulder is everything in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women?
Is it the other?
It's the other.
Women.
The second sex.
The second sex.
Women.
It's not essential.
It's not defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity.
That it's all.
So I kept doing my research.
I realized it's in the history of civilization.
Many times you create excluded groups.
Excripted like...
The blacks?
Excrites like the projectmen, or the Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They say "us" they identify themselves.
However, women.
They don't identify themselves easily.
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name?
What about a black woman?
A funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
What about a projectory?
Women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live dispersed inside a group of men.
Anything.
Al board?
It is quite satisfying to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists.
Did they work?
Theories in religion, theory, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions.
Many men usually ask me.
A: Do you wish that because you're a woman?
Of course?
As if I had ovaries and a uterus and rule and hormones I would take away any objectivity.
Well, as if they were, when they wrote their...
Teachers.
They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
What I want.
In other words, it's conscious of these differences and understand them.
Sharing what I understood.
Sharing what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
Audience: Yes.
And within everything I told you that I studied biology, physiology, etc.
And let me tell you something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Is nature like that?
Society doesn't dictate, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
A woman is not born.
It gets to be done.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer.
At the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
A complete integrated individual.
It's integral.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Possau.
To have children.
Give yourself to create them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to them.
Therefore.
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, a lot is missing.
What I do intend.
Are we aware of that?
To awareness about these differences.
And how does it feel shy?
that you can make decisions.
With the clouds in a TED talk.
What I want to share.
So, it is that each woman.
And every man.
He can and must decide what he wants for his sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Every woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to conscientize.
That this is effort.
It has to be done together.
Between men.
And women.
What I want is to conscientize.
That when the second sex...
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a society.
Complete.
It's powerful.
Very good!
Men and women completely complete and free.
Thank you!
(Applause)
(Applause) Anastares, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the whole role, which is a hipno.
In search of freedom.
A book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go.
Like golden wings about mountains and colines.
And in the end it says.
And this spiral, these thoughts, why do they give them?
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdias wrote, "Open Abuca sees."
More than 100 years and us.
We can take it as our own.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home.
Because you know them, right?
Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Applause) A couple of years ago, a group of friends from my school went out to marry for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my other, and to be able with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them?
I accompanied my voice.
And my mom.
And that he couldn't steal a parade from the time of the Congress.
He came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
He looked around him!
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics?
That is to say, what I think, to get out of what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
And I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of books and movies on teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter works, the Games of Ambre, divergent, the geniic chronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all of them?
There are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And in all of them?
There are teenagers.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a distopy.
It's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our head in a distopy.
terrifying like the one of climate change.
Where we, young people, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes, I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where a ball does.
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
In the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me.
To pay attention to the people who make xenophobes comments.
Or by discussing political things.
And...
While many people prefer to avoid these topics to not generate fights or uncomfortable situations.
Me!
I know there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why a relative of mine makes a macho comment.
I'll discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or the legalization of abortion.
I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
And I talk to this person.
I hear your opinion.
And I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
And to resguard our present.
I hope that more and more we start to see markets and political spaces in general, not as dangerous, something that scares.
but as a space for personal and social growth.
of union and inspiration.
And I hope there's always, but there's always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly.
And to say, without a bit of surprise.
It's full of kids.
Thank you very much.
You can imagine having to walk for hours every day.
Taking a cup like this one.
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
It was like that of contamination.
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes.
And we will all have to face the future.
This is how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN.
What did you attend?
Nowadays, due to global climate action for water, a couple of days ago in chestnut.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings.
Us?
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the manantial lakes.
Through agriculture.
From livestock?
Of our big companies?
Even our own daily activities.
Although we don't give ourselves things.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
Five?
Children per day.
According to the World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people in 2016.
They live without access to drinking water in the world.
This is what matters.
Why if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth?
At least two.
Are there serious problems?
To have access to water.
Of that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
Because this continent has 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, for example Peru.
Right?
What is octavo country with largest hydroe reserves in the world?
Do you have at least 30 percent of the population?
Without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico.
Fronest with the United States of America.
Where, by the way, Mr. Trump now wants to build a wall, that is even closer to these two countries.
Almost 20 million people.
In other words, around 20% of the country's population.
She lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with such natural wealth?
They meet in front of this situation.
In this pinete, it's exactly with a problem that we can do to help increase this problem. During the way we were going to meet rural communities and capsines to Peru, that we put humans to the work to bring drinking water, and after many weeks of research, the bazla, or money resources, for the logistics of our project, but above all, the people who practically have nothing.
(Laughter) Being crazy, clean water, retaining in 1999, contaminated water goes by end, older than with a water molecule... (Laughter) The contaminated water goes by the end.
The veling system, which is a completely revolutionary system, if we consider that only the weight of the water to make the team work, you can imagine, the empire of these painters, in the life of all these people... Well, and now?
We want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old boy.
that belongs to the colony 15th October 15th in the trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community.
But it's funny.
Both him, like all his poplars.
They used a lot of money and time.
to get drinking water.
Because the handmandial that was supported was very polluted by skeptical stages around.
To our move.
Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine it.
The illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all of those.
All those agents in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
Is it total?
We delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on.
More than 15,000 people.
Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua.
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
You will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago.
When Projectecto Guateman they're going to conquer an idea.
Well, we realize a little of the dream that we had the opportunity to live.
But, in this dream?
We were never alone.
before leaving?
More than 400 people.
They took their goal through a crowdfunding campaign.
which was destined to 100% of exclusive purchases.
Of the water filters.
And it's not a month later.
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
Together?
We have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
It can be one of the risks, of the greater risks.
To the one facing the human being.
In the next 10 years.
According to the world's economic supply, what don't we hear?
So?
We ask ourselves the question of ego.
How is it possible?
Would I have reached this situation?
Why have we reached this situation?
It's not another one that has an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We have created a lot of necessities.
That we all know they are unnecessary?
That sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer?
So that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
We, in this project.
We have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
Where we've seen as big embotellers.
They were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were taking their entire access to water.
What do you think you are doing?
For those land.
The great oil producers.
The big oilfield.
so that we can all fill the deposit of our vehicles.
What they are doing here is to contaminate.
It's to destroy forests and rivers of communities or oranis of the Amazon, we've been there.
And it's amazing.
They are making the communities have to be moved.
And in the future?
This is probably going to cause.
It's that it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible.
And living it hasn't left us.
It has left us open.
It's really something that...
And we really think it seems.
That it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality.
That it's not just that.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality that, November 12, 2016.
It's affecting us directly.
To everyone and each one.
You feel in this room.
It's not necessary.
And it's very far.
In California?
With a world of technological development.
And they're mapping people for consuming too much water.
And they are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
A Spain.
In Spain we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
The more water houses will suffer in the future.
What if it really?
We want to make a change.
What if it really?
We want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is all of us.
To recognize ourselves.
What we all have to do.
It's motivating, it's learning about these problems, and what we have to do is educate all our children, all our families, about what problems and real needs are.
Do you agree?
What are the solutions?
That they will really be sustainable.
What we have to do.
It is to support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
That small NGO.
who is trying to build powers in Guatemala to display these communities.
Unfortunately, they continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try to exercise a bit of pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really be?
Making change.
The life these big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value.
The amazing luck we have.
To reach our homes.
Opening the glass of water.
And that always leaves water.
Or it's not like that.
Please, let's stop mourning this resource.
It seems like no, but believe me.
It's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act.
And we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness?
But we don't act.
This way we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
Existen.
Many voices to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
A game, how nice it is for here.
The beautiful thing to see so many attentive faces.
I'm going to start the conference by making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
Emotion has a strength many times higher than thought, the electromagnetic frequency that creates a thought is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "I don't."
It speaks from the heart.
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
If you open your heart, you will surely receive 1000% of what I'm going to say.
And that we remain trapped in our minds.
We certainly receive only one part, so that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines, to give.
To give us no context, how is society today, raise your hand and say three or four quick answers?
It stopped.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
An accident of tea, okay!
In my conferences, today it is.
And 30 or 40 possibilities for me to give me this kind of answers, you were given the answers.
They were old, right?
And then there's another question.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy.
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
There are around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
What are you?
What are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they've always told us more or less questions, they'd have told us in that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
It's not called!
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we see, is tied to the media.
Information where ...
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the children and we tell them: look for good news, bad and neutral news, day money, right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Now, that's it.
This is what happens to us naturally when we ask an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes on fashion, when I ask this once football is said, basket, rugby, not well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, which are in fashion today, the first, national sports.
The complaint.
We complain absolutely everything.
They saw it, that is, first we leave the weather: heat that's 3rd of January 3 pm. Oh, how crazy!
How cold it's 7 of July at 7 am?
The first we leave the weather, then we leave the traffic, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something, something is wrong.
When they ask me, "How are you perfectly good? It's a joy dish? What happened to you?
"Oh, don't complain about anything."
That is, we have become a society of quologists.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change this, it's a disaster, or this has to change.
And we have to change the country, society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into claims, sociologists, claims, and the maximum, or pinologists and all achievements.
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
Have you ever heard of it?
If this doesn't feel empowered to opt.
But wait for everything, I've produced it with my friends, I'm a friend Ferrando.
I go to the t-shirt with him and I tell him, "You know why you stay with no battery because it's the place, you see that the soup was up? Do you know why the soup was up?
You understand that pain is going down there, because we know everything, we choose economy, politics, and...
Who's most worrying now?
We have started to have our minds oriented to the crisis.
We complain, complain.
We're immersive in opinion.
What does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged by 100 percent.
A chargator, for the doubts that he doesn't have a lot of load, but with our energy there was.
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
We needed everything to change.
That the country in good shape, that the weather is not the case, because recently I was overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the rhythm what wonderful day, and the rhythm says to me: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced rain."
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society above all our generation.
What have we left our society in a moral crisis that wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine?
Dearded, breathed, but badly, we are making our children believe.
But we serve for nothing, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
We don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how is this phrase represented there?
Do you see how architects are?
And what do you want?
We're in Argentina.
We hear this and if it were worldwide, be: What can we do?
We only leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I graduated.
That the ability was important to get out of that world I lived in, that had been complaining, which was hell.
That talent...
It was important, I had to have talent, experience, and I formed more and more about this, I saw that all of them add up, everything smoke, right?
So I looked for more knowledge, more skill, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
And all these things add up, but the attitude ...
Multiplicates.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimist type, that's a pessimist guy.
And if you have a deserved attitude, that's a type of merd.
Sorry.
So I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude?
How to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I would do.
Who searches for the changes I wanted to see?
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justified, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw.
The protagonist of the installation is a square meter, this square meter I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And for me, and you see what here in this square meter, I vibrate with the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world.
With one!
Aisa that says "free."
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started showing what I wanted to talk about.
I started to decide to live in a different world because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I went to the subway and I told him, "Tell me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was hell and I was in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full.
But hell and paradise is not a place.
It's a decision, because I have hell there next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
Where it begins to complain all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
If we'll always be waiting for someone to change this.
- Well, I went to the man, of course.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not everyone has the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's just one.
With the example: every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So you're already in the way to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change the protagonist things, those people in change, are not waiting for someone to ruin my life.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare.
And you're with a group of failures, that's a failure, that's in a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
If you start a square meter, to contagiate solidarity or optimism, you start to emit that energy, why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco was to buy a kilo of side, one would say it, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "Pelices Pascuas" and she tells me: "These people were born and I, in the first one that made me happy.
And I tell him, "Hey, you told the 300 happy people, you know what?"
The name.
What are you waiting for?
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What are you up to?
A respect?
You respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, what is emitting, what is it that does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you get, this is like MMS, if you are in AM and you go from one AM point to the other side, you will listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody.
And it's more, in fact, having the long ones.
The frequency you want to hear, you can choose.
But if you're in ADM, even if you go from one end to the other, you'll listen to it.
In other words, the world is how we created it.
They live in paradise, but hell is a decision, I get up in the morning and I begin to say, "The first game is playing against myself."
"Oh, I'm up, I don't get up."
Well, I wake up, what had a progress done with humour, or with good humor?
A bad humour, or not, like in humor.
I always say "prepared predisposed," I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence or creative media, there is this difference, the path you take is a blind as you wake up.
His victims and the protagonists.
You're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come or you're going to make the interests that today are governing us and taking us from domesticated drugs, people are lead by fear.
My father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to share two life experiences with this foundation of acts and borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we did last week, we gathered veterans of war of Argentinians and Victims, a Royal Marim Británico came, a burk.
And they gathered Argentine competitories and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
Do you know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew?
There was a doubt, a measuring unit is her.
If they taught me that they were bad guys, if now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a blind is born.
I invite you to see it and I'm going to tell you two life stories.
I had the blessing.
To live with the Markuy Foundation without Borders was: in 2012, I went to work on a gas tank for a conflict between realities and prestigious realities for 70 years.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
And I understood what.
All the time I was worried about what was missing, and one morning I see a Palestine woman in Belén's city embraces other ladies and celebrations, there's no celebration, so I say.
And they are celebrating.
Then the translator says to me: "The water tank was filled."
What does that water orange mean?
If it has drinking water at home, to drink every week.
If you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
They celebrated it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
Do you know what the genius is in lamparadine all through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
I do explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladine.
And I tell her: "I work with you, what did I ask for?"
He looks at me all excited.
to gain my hot water bathrooms.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment.
All the time was connected with what was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
If I could give me a bathroom, I would have it.
Where to sleep?
So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
It stopped me from being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had.
To conclude this, I want to propose an exercise all of you in this state that we are now.
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step.
I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
Close your eyes.
Imagine this moment.
All the things we have to never give them.
Valor, we don't give him any importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to be able to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
Like with our senses, our friends.
How many more things?
We take them for assault, but we never do them.
We list them.
But the second part of this exercise has to do.
So all the people in this room have it.
Now you feel, what have you been?
And...
You read or selected.
Or chose by all you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until this moment.
He listened to that gratitude.
(Applause) Well, what's up there, very strong, I ask you all of us, that we are in a society at a moment in deciding, very well, for the protagonists we can do in our lives, with what we have, with what we receive, what we receive, what we receive, very well above, by the abundance we unite, that you see there for a moment.
The longest way to go?
There are four stadiums when we get rid of our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbu for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
This that we just felt and this feeling.
And that every day of your life, when you go to a shower.
Do you remember what?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Is the genius of Aradin's lamp?
He asks it.
And what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we are going to travel.
If we were going to the hell, or if we were going to paradise.
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
To musicalize is to awaken the inner world and share it with others, and you don't need to be an instrumentist or be a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin.
In bones, in rhythms.
But music also lives in the pauses.
In silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language.
What integrates worlds since we are little and play with sound as if it were a player?
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go all together and grow in community.
Music?
It generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
so that we can welcome ourselves, say goodbye.
A classicator, games and songs.
Who welcomed?
(Applause) Believe me that it's not easy to face this in front of a sea of people.
Imagine then what bullying must be like.
bullying those physical or verbal agencies that usually happen in schools, that's why they're also known as school support.
It's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems.
However, it's been 5 or 10 years ago.
I think few of us have heard this word "bullying".
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new, that it's something that always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age we have, we have an experience with this type of situations, that is, because we live it in our own meat or because...
Or because we simply press it, before it was called "Take a point to someone to mock."
Now, that is bullying.
Well, but I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, you have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
And this for various reasons.
First, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
It wasn't news, the media were not discussed, we tried to promise laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was more or less normal.
It's capable of an unwanted consequence, an lateral effect, with the probe of school coexistence, but not that serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to the children's education.
But there's something important, which is that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school dramas were considered much more serious.
And that those little keys without importance that would happen in recess and in halls.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now going out you tend to be the opposite, right?
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time, not on the one hand, these most traditional reasons of school humiliations, which are bad grades and disciplinary repriments, which are increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying occupies a more central role.
Or a director, students, made something considered incorrect, something forbidden by regulations, or something considered it shouldn't be done, like behaving bad or not studying, on the one hand, it loses weight.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
Books of school humiliation, which are these castles.
Because the same students apply to each other.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a big historical change about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, intonestations, bad grades.
What operates there is fault.
Choose for having done something wrong, something bad.
Guilt is an internal, private emotion, it refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each of us, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be, because it's incorrect, but that everyone thinks that it's bad, even me.
I feel guilty because I did something wrong.
(Laughter) Now, in the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's at stake.
No, but another kind of emotion.
embarrassment.
Because it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
It doesn't refer to a private drama of each one by himself, for having done something bad, in the case of shame.
The problem is not me, but the others, the others.
The look of others.
Don't judge me!
It has been an incorrect and just way, sometimes cruel.
Beyond having fault or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that exercise my cruel look, so it's a transformation, and I believe this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because I think that the alien look, the look of others.
And obviously it was always important.
Lately, he has won a demeasurable weight, maybe, above all, at the moment of playing, who is each one and how much is worth?
This wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, that's not from now, that's been managing for decades, and that's finishing of consuming, now it's crystallizing now, and it seems to me one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a belief.
Fundamental.
During 200 years that previous us, and made it 9, 20, the conviction that the inner life existed.
Is there any essential?
It was invisible to the eyes.
That creates that defined each one in a much deeper and true way that the vanish appearances.
Those appearances.
Not only were they considered bananas.
but also fake, private.
As something lower, it doesn't matter.
I have compared with all the dissemination of that inner truth or beauty.
(Laughter) Well, I think all of this are values and beliefs that are still within us, but we are abandoning them.
So we're already transforming ourselves and we're abandoning those beliefs, for example, in the case of the vanish appearances, I find it pretty clear that they're no longer so late.
Think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in the last decades.
The importance of personal image, physical aspect, gymnastics, esthetic treatments, all that.
(Laughter) It also matters a lot and it's called meaning each time and it's what you see.
And this notion is lost that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that are not the trips, not that they are inside each one, but that are not the trips but something immaterial.
Like the soul or the spirit.
It seemed that we are less growing without that.
And more and more, in what others can see, what we show, what we do.
And according to these changes.
The others judge us from what they see.
And less from that notion that there is something inside, eternal and aerial innerity, middle Victoria, an anti-psymer ana, that would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this.
They seem to us a series of indices of transformations and one of them would be the car for emotion.
No, the tactics or the self-production techniques.
Today they are everywhere.
And that until recently it would be considered a bad taste.
No, but let's think of an example.
The conquest, the obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "I like."
No, this also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms, source phenomena for years, since they go from tattoos.
Until plastic surgeries.
What's going on in reality shows?
And for bullying.
I think that thinking about this broader context doesn't surprises that today bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
When amonestations and bad grades?
They are increasingly low.
Because it seems the fault.
And he lost a good part of his moralizing effect.
That is, fault is no longer so effective.
Like embarrassment.
To produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
Two sides that seem contradictory on one side.
Do we have to expose ourselves?
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are.
And what we do then we have to grow and spread our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk.
That this alien look, doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance as well, that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying when these mothers are...
Or spreads are disseminated by social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what it used to be private, to limit the group of acquaintances or...
It is protected by the walls of the school or house, suddenly it exposes to millions of people, everybody knows.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, much more serious, and we don't have where to take refuge.
Not inside yourself.
Not intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping an island somehow.
That there are more and less or less exist, at least not without Wi-Fi, which is the theme.
AC: So, it seems like this idea that hell is us.
It has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection.
And the profiles are always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we may poster with respect to ourselves.
Well, if all this is happening in fact this historical change with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do?
This is better or worse than before, it's good or bad, as we solve it.
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution.
But I think I have some clues of...
Or do you think so much guilt, or shame?
They are mechanisms of social control.
And the fact that guilt is losing a good part of their work, now, and that embarrassment is magnifying, that's not good or bad in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind.
That is, it's a fact.
Because if we continue, which means things changed in fact, so if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we don't try to solve as if it were the same, we will probably not go very far.
That's what he wanted to say, thank you.
(Applause) So we talked with my kids at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
That we wouldn't forget these days.
One of the people told me.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment.
But for the good ones.
I dedicate myself to researching its education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength, in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us, without wanting.
Exploring what happens?
In a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I've come to think a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn?
This educational scenario we don't choose.
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
And I would like to share three of those ideas that keep spinning around these days and that I hope in one of those...
They serve us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency to dare test new ways of teaching.
Innovation and education is something close to what is being talked about.
But until now, it was happening isolately by separate.
And from one day to another, everyone, simultaneously.
We had to help to take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency.
Those of us who dedicate ourselves to teaching are having to rediscover our classes at a distance.
And in that process?
As if we are encouraging to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
I wanted to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available, but that we had never had before.
urgency in difficult periods of need to use.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms.
Social networks, media, so-called virus.
So it gives them a result to keep teaching.
Especially to keep connecting with the students, with the families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I think.
Once we tried them, we use them.
These strategies are already being samples, they are already part of what we know how to do.
From our box of tools.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings.
To have to adapt them so fast.
Even trying to have patience, do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
And we're grabbing the taste.
to test new ways of teaching and learning.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know, from yoga lessons.
Until yesterday in tissue.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as if in these days they are older than...
He started to show how the compound is.
For that, bankers, people of their age.
We're learning in community.
The second reduction of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to predict.
In a research we did last year, we prohibited teenagers who imagined the ideal school.
Just like what happened once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed.
Do I have it?
A space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn.
And when and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially when only teenagers.
Learn better when they can organize their own times.
Some study more at night.
Others start with the subjects that are most interested in.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to end up understanding something that doesn't happen to them.
Or to learn something new that they wanted.
This also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working on the wall.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
For a thousand youngsters.
organizing their time.
Magestioning the tasks and everything that needs to learn.
And my last reflection.
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as happens?
Nowadays we don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school.
It disappears stronger than ever is a need like space that guarantees that everyone can learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
I don't know if these days are happening.
We realize it.
The difficult thing is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's never the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
They have a calm place to study and not.
And they have here to ask and not.
The one who has to do all the care tasks at home.
And why not?
The school.
With all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
They are protected.
And focused on that.
And he learned.
As an educator, it worries a lot about how this will follow.
And I also wonder what will remain of what we're learning in this quarantine.
And the feeling of this day is.
You see when you climb the tide and you stay the naked beach.
Among everything that devastates that tide.
What breaks.
What is taken.
Also on the beach, some treasures seemed hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
This historical moment isn't for the good ones.
It helps us be own.
Those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relate to the use of time and ways of learning and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
Yes!
Physics are closed.
In one of those I'm opening a door to keep building.
Between all of us.
When all this happens.
It's an education we dream of.
Thank you very much.
At night I dreamed that the Corentena lasted too long for two months and suddenly ...
We got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control.
Conduced by truck drivers in chairs are chairs.
From his home.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up 7 toM to study sleeping.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand.
The work of Bubble Drail, finally.
That motoschologists learned to cyber-attack.
that mythomans and chisms gathered in the spread of conspirantolid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions, pangphiles, naive.
They shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for dislivering and dreaming.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years.
In the elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, we appreciated a button.
Marigón at the free, yes, or Marjuana Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then he always earned most of a day for the other quickly.
Without Northern administrators, or theoretical deputies, deciding instead of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also like that.
Money gave them the curves on YouTube.
And of course, it was forbidden to emigrate them to Youton Kirls.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported the lawyers and the judges.
And that from one day to another, all those who had ever been rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
through Google E.A.
And what about in the end?
We got used to buying in the neighborhood's businesses.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they did before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that united who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
No, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
I dreamed that we had to see TED talks from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the State ...
It sent us a 3D printer to each of us to buy imported products.
I dreamed that at night, in the big cities, stars would come back to see each other, they were doors like in the field and that in the field.
But all of a sudden, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day ...
Many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
In a very short communicator, the president told the people that it was possible to go out to the street.
That you could make a normal life, leave saying the president, occupy your jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed July 9th.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked towards the defeat.
To make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We suffocated it.
And we killed it.
And that a truck without sloppers.
I was fighting against the snail of the struggle and it was coming back.
And they fell off the truck.
Sounds of wine cardboard.
And that more people came out of their house.
In the cock.
Take selfies out with the dead avestruz and steal wine.
And there were screams.
And soon someone joined another and the journalists showed up again.
To transmit live massacre and then, over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
I felt better.
(Applause) It's not something like when you see a picture.
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
(Applause)
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there is photogeneration.
What does this mean?
That photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it.
So a few years ago I started actively.
To draw.
Do we add the idea of what?
When you draw, you draw.
What you think is that you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing.
(Laughter) And the idea of what to know.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
We have to look closely at the visible.
Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?
And he told me that
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds.
I'd eat the last one with a cream that was left in the drawer.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started to the floor, I started to see everything that person had published until the date.
Does it turn out that in a girl who's about a month ago?
I had uploaded a photo with the beautiful ones of number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I knew I was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some pieces of art and banks.
And I said, "That's it, this girl likes art."
Something that later I confirmed with some photos in which she seemed to paint.
All of that was going down and I discovered who one of you currently was your best friend.
Because it's a transvest girl who grew up last year and who is now studying graphic design.
And among all that I could also see that it's a healthy person, who has to rent him and drink him, so he is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
My mom was very shocking.
I couldn't believe that I could know someone like that through social media.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show.
but because it's there that means that it's something 100 percent real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To go from a general idea of that person, to know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personality, their tastes, their family, friends, and then make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant.
Multicultural and it has a great social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it.
Or why does she choose to show no to her reality?
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mom.
I went back to see some publications that had called my attention, like when I talked about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself: What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it?
And if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I spoke to my mom and I ate very deserved, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social networks.
It transformed the screens and it's present in my daily meetings.
My behavior in the real world, so to say it, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing.
And, obviously, I ask her dream on social networks, thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's not that pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
For two eyes.
In different parts of the face.
You might have stopped somewhere.
Effectively.
Some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci.
They knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build.
The look of a portrait.
Also, the nazial buildings, the mouth's cracks, the limits of their ears.
Even the pores and details were fundamental elements to form what we would call.
The look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these artists knew.
Which were the faces parts that the spectators searched?
And developing a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she's looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought about it.
What would it be if we could see how I look at a spectrum?
In a research team, in a neuroscience laboratory, we put several portraits.
In front of many people, we register the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get.
It's how we build the image in time.
How?
Our eyes select specific parts of that face.
To extract information, since it's the rest.
It constitutes the brain.
If we placed all the images, all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when we put together.
The portrait, and what is not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter, of that look, of the portrait, that we just talked about.
And the look of the spectators.
So we thought about it.
How would it be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together?
The look of others.
What we built was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This tremendous rehearsal for the journey of an eye.
It's somehow a stranger.
Some of the projects led together to Mariano Sigman.
an intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Bostudes, languages.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The search of this kindness.
Two questions and the expectation.
Thank you very much.
At the exact moment in which we are born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me.
What are you so young taking care of old people?
It's my future that I answered.
I want to live for many years and that's how I go.
What they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
No!
Fear?
Let's live in a society?
Where is the most important thing?
Is it being?
Or seem young.
Miedo.
To help my knowledge and my experience.
They are going to lose value.
What's my word?
It hasn't taken into account.
Miedo.
Let's go to the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities.
In laborial searchs.
In the jokes we make.
And the worst of all.
It's that many times.
We don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
Let's see some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the vessor of social debt tells us that 70 percent of the elderly people in Argentina are self-beatable.
Does it mean that they can take care of themselves?
And to take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
that the elderly are sad or depressed.
when it's 80 percent.
It can be happy.
And that is much more than what people in my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label.
Clash passive.
(Video ends) Who just seems this definition to me?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know?
It's hard for a person.
65 more.
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However.
I've never found it.
Not a scholarship.
And a call.
Not even a funding opportunity.
That includes it.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
It's the majority of public universities in our country.
There's no matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field.
that in the 70s are invited to be retired by age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit?
This happens to 69.
You can teach them.
And at 71 no.
The media.
They aren't helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them.
Why each time they treat the issue of older people using the same photo?
And that...
From the older person in a park bank, giving them eat the dove, what do you place?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
The bad media has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults.
Third age.
Really.
The elderly are the pieces.
Gerant.
Ansians.
I still don't find a word.
That identify the conformity to everyone.
The only one that would suggest to avoid?
Is it grandfather or grandmother?
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But it's because of affection.
I could say "maddy" because she is a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
The elderly people.
They have a name.
Like all of us.
The stereotypes?
They stimulate them.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina.
There are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
Are we now?
A old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs.
To design new products and services.
This new longevity.
It opens up new doors for us to rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However.
Office and education proposals exist.
They are thought, almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly.
I'm a very different group.
That doesn't respond to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people?
To really understand?
What are your new needs?
Its new possibilities.
of blind people.
And you like it.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each step in life.
It has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Thank you very much.
