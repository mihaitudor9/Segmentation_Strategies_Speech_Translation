Not for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
A: Learn.
to feel, think and act in a sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the Lomboc Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
I mean, with that feeling of instability.
It's surrounded by a big biodiversity.
turtles, harvests, corals, mold fish.
And fish from all colors.
I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature.
It was a mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed as a small fish.
And black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
And you think, "This teacher is crazy, he speaks with fish, right?
And it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them about it.
That is, they look at each other.
And they say, "Gee, the teacher is crazy."
A: But I'm not crazy.
And for that I bring you a scientific test.
But from the globe fish, an artist.
The work is 24.
For one.
For you?
That work of art that we are going to do.
Or on the contrary.
The maritime current would take it.
That screw we see.
It shows you that nature has awareness.
And I'm not a philosophy.
And if I am able to talk to others.
Is it true that indigenous peoples from origins?
You can talk to others.
Or with rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena.
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific evidence, last year Science magazine published a study where 1,200 ecosystems of diverse still are analyzed.
Scientists?
And they told me.
There is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between prey and predators.
In other words, for each four smoke there were three lions.
Or on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Well, paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern.
It is reproduced inside us, in our organic physiology.
I remember Cleíber's law.
It's an elephant that has a size a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse.
But three, four.
And if you stop to think about it?
And the planet we live in?
It is composed of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I wonder.
Is it a simple coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study.
It's the great story of my doctoral research.
That is, all those sciences.
What do uniforms integrate?
And the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of human beings.
That's when I realized that nature has a principle and strategy.
That we should imitate and perfect.
To achieve a sustainable development.
And here you bring a summary.
I remember the broken consensus.
It's like the explosion of the Big Bang.
The universe emerged 13.7 billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.500.
Thousands of years!
And the act of life.
Between 13, 1800.
Three, 500 million years.
During the first life of these people.
Well, the life forms of the Earth were maintained at very simple levels.
I have the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere.
That is, the first complex cells were originated.
And here is the president.
With the Cambrical exclusion of methaneous, biological variety has increased very fast.
We form a wide range of organisms, cell phones points.
Because we are developing survival strategies.
We look for very singular energy.
Like, for example.
DB: Cadina.
The accident seems to indicate that life followed and the depths of the oceans.
He couldn't reach the Earth until 450 million years ago.
With the disappearance of the dinosaurs of the legal period.
66 million years ago the hegemonic period began from the mammals, where I came from later.
One of the first or minimum pepperies.
Thanks to the possible remains found up to echox, it's known that authropologists have about 4 million years.
The homosexuals are the two million, toothpaste sneakers and homo sapis, 200,000 years old.
(Laughter) Currently, Homo sapiens is the only survival of human species.
Ecoavit and co-evolves on the planet Earth.
Together with the rest of his rich Diodiversity.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago and especially since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago.
Human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed.
It was like something insufficient.
In three?
In a 30- or maybe parliament?
100 million species.
A single species?
A new one?
It's destroying.
The processes of co-volution of the rest of species.
And that is to be.
And we are all responsible.
In other words, life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve everything.
But human beings still wanting to destroy everything around them.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
It seems that we have forgotten about irosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees degrees.
And why if that was little?
But future generations are also threatened.
That is to say, due to the great ecological footprint we left in the Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
Well, since 1990.
Until 2020 we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Do I follow the world's forum of nature?
All of us, the whole citizen of the world, imitating the models and life styles given in the United States, we would need four planets like the New Year.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
Have you ever heard of it?
The use of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming.
And what does this mean?
Imagine we close the doors and the windows of this theater and we fire the boats in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine.
You know the barbarie, right?
Well, it's the stage that we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic shortage of natural resources.
They won't be able to develop themselves in a dignity way, that's why people learn how to cooperate.
In other words, Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it's true that there is violence and prevention and excessive in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation, I give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Moving forward, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not competence, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
Well, soccer, for example.
But we all know that a team competes against another.
But we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the thermal body behind.
Is it our body?
It's a pluricellular organism.
That is to say, where millions of cells cooperate to make of us what we do.
Paradoxically, nature is the best way of imitating it and perfecting to reach sustainable societies.
After 3800 million years of coevolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered glacial disasters, meteorites and constant processes of linear trial.
Doctrine is political, like anarchism that failed communism, which also failed.
Socialism failed and capitalism failed too.
A study by Oxfan last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99 percent.
That is to be crazy.
And that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That is, that they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is sick pathologically and that it takes care, because it advances nature to obtain economic benefit.
We have sent garbage to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
Well, money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
In other words, bio, life, my fantastic imitation and imitation of life, but this is not new.
This is already done by the original peoples, indigenous people, for thousands of years, and it's something inside all of us, we all have that college.
And I invite you.
Let's do a game.
It's an imagination.
What happens to this wire?
How could engineers, architects do?
The economists inspired me.
Well, it occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to their peak?
From the birds, Martín Bolador.
Well, the Japanese made the Bach train.
And with this bat?
We could make a trunk.
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
Could we build bioclimatic buildings?
And with this turning on its own.
GB: A solar panel plant.
As we know, there are millions of species.
In nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we continue.
Do we think about nature?
To be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive phrase.
of GDP.
What does PIB mean?
Many economists tell us we have to manufacture, to build.
To increase the amount of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to bring raw materials.
For the industry.
But we have to be aware.
That the world we live in isn't a gift from our parents, but a loans of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think?
If we don't do everything in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started.
Can you imagine?
Do we have a future in dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
And I would like her to tell me.
Pah!
At least you try it.
AC: Thank you.
AD: And you.
What would you like to do?
(Laughter) And what I want to say is that the fourth of our opportunity and cover my mind.
They're laughing things.
The speaker we're not going to do everything we need.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, lying.
We spend it bad, socially with good, we miss our friends.
This is asleep, there's nothing to do with the aspect, and not about why you think it's an opportunity to take advantage of it and we're not leaving something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do I say that?
In other words, life isn't about anything else, that horrible moments and learning about them, we learn the pain of the disease.
We understand it from war, it doesn't die death.
We've always done it and we'll keep doing it.
So.
Well, that's what we are going to do now.
And I think I'm not only bringing it.
It's an idea I've been meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, so cinema is right to the hormone.
These are the newspapers that have already brought me in the 80s when they diagnosed with HIV and then decide to return to their passion from childhood to kindergarten, three men from a cinema until, in fact, after their diagnosis.
And they are a lot of movies, some very important ones, some of the important spaces of their career.
But what he decides is that he will buy a land instead of a horrible hospital and he will take care of a garden.
And what was impressive.
As a person writes you.
For him, taking care of a kindergarten was not having time.
It wasn't, well.
Let's spend the time.
Not like now that we spend the while cooking towards the bread.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks that allow us are those."
And then they thought of the concept of reproductive work, which is a concept that comes out of machismo.
From the Fri of Gengers, basically, and who later took particularly the next feminist.
To talk about reproductive work, not even productive work, which is the one that put new things in the world, we can say, I always get stuck or a slave, it doesn't matter.
And this is a reproductive work that reproduces the conditions for us to do.
Playing, cooking, taking care, right?
AC: Do we start?
We have to cook to the workers so that the next day they put the factory, their reproductive work, and the seed for a long time.
Spreading correctly, that reproductive work is also there.
But in general, what we produce, what we keep is that reproductive work has economic value because it's useful to make productive work, because if workers don't eat or not in the factory.
A: Now, why is the edge of zero in that relative value first of all we don't think of an absolute value?
And even more, why don't we do it like dissoting ejeerman and thinking that this difference is contrasted between productive and reproductive work is a difference?
It's more unhappy given by one side.
Of course, gender, for the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are the productive, traditionally performed by the oronas.
And reproductive ones.
And it brings it if you don't interview it because women are important.
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject of the original, produced by the golden in the world, that the subject that takes care of, is something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you an artist.
They don't make you think, they don't make you an important person, right?
These are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the other way round, even the care tasks are the most important, do they have two days?
We are living, yes, publicists, without writers.
In "Sill a lot of things" even moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food and without care.
And without nurses and health.
Well, the only thing that was allowed us.
Is it eating?
And heal.
And clean.
And without that, the world?
In all of us.
A: Is that scared?
They have a not relative value, they have an absolute value.
And not only that, what?
But not just a mechanic that we need to go through the river.
I wish there weren't any, maybe you could do this, clean the thing.
kitchen is not to solve food.
Maybe, we can think like that, we have planned them for a long time.
But what I thought when I read Ayarman is that...
And, precisely, can we also live them differently?
As tasks with a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that has to do with thinking precisely that the title is not modern nature, modernity, not like...
It's the human being separated from the natural world that...
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
but the relationship of care with nature.
But it's also something interesting.
At the lesion of care with our bodies, we think we have to take care of our bodies.
No, there's the gym, we have to cook.
No, only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
She looked at me.
And that is also a strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are.
And that the body is going to do what we have to overcome.
I think...
Isn't it an opportunity?
And, in fact, at its point, I want to go back to my life.
No, no, the world doesn't need more soap operas and I want to write a soap opera, that's life.
We all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
Now!
Well, given, the world needs more soap operas.
Well, I thought, well.
Why not?
And instead of positioning ourselves to keep being productive these days.
And to know all the matches and with that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with care, with the others, in another way from that?
That's why, when I was invited to do this passive thing, because I thought I didn't want to have an original idea, the world hadn't been that it was a soap opera and the world doesn't need to bring it.
But that's why I thought we're going to write.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I was.
That I had with my books and that might help other people, right?
But why?
I wrote, right?
What else to do?
Be careful.
People, when they are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what doesn't work with.
No more bread.
S: No more sweet, no more posters.
It's every 15 days.
Has it happened?
An end of a half.
These foods don't get fat.
QD: What wakes up is the unmed and disordened way in which we consume them.
But today I want to name you.
Three key aspects.
Yes, to have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
AC: One time, a teacher told me: "Onstage of secondary awareness to brain activity."
And with brain activity, losing experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious one.
Our desires, our beliefs.
So, if consciousness is high school.
He grew up.
And we would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
On the contrary, the one that's not the most.
And after that?
We are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating.
And in which amount?
QD: A good fact is not going to the super I love.
Because when we are hungry, we are not hungry.
The hunger of everything is hunger and hunger.
And desire becomes immobile to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
It's always forbidden.
It has been the most tempting, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about jokes.
B, dream, hug, an escape with double cheese.
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
In other words, pix.
Thank you, I prefer a needle.
Impossible, huh?
Second.
How?
It's like every process in life.
You learn.
In this case, and in many cases.
And that my inclusion is released.
But we must learn to eat in this station.
What does this mean?
To eat the food that was costed at that time.
PK: This is going to guarantee a control.
And an equilibrium in our weight and putting a god in our health.
A: Because foods surrounded by their own times.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest food in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not addressed with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and green?
So this mechanism has led to practice.
What are we going to guarantee?
Well, it will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony to eat the humble.
The last aspect?
That for me it's one.
That is, it's not less, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
To those who don't mess up.
Because they are not hungry, because they don't have time, because they often give Ausias.
And I have a question.
Do you think about it?
And they give them Ausias.
Repeting the plate of matches with a tape.
To think, right?
PK: So?
What do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
Because hunger is not variable.
Yes, they restring food, if they eat.
It's what wasn't consumed during the day, it's going to consume in the afternoon or night, and in double part.
To make it more graphic is like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volume.
And increasingly stronger.
So, if we don't stop.
Each three.
Four hours.
A: To take a break.
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unfold the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating.
So, the smaller I am going to be, the more weight I'm going to lose, and no.
The most experienced body becomes in reserve.
And I said, "Guys."
And when I mean reservation, I mean this, all we want to eliminate from our block.
PK: The food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave for favor of ignorance.
Food can hurt you or can cure you.
It depends on us, about taking awareness, what are we feeding and in what amount?
So I go back.
And the moderation.
Just as there is the sentence that you must know it, drink with moderation.
It should exist a coma with moderation.
That such food stimulates overweight.
To give a closure?
I propose you to eat rich.
I'm going to eat everything you like.
To eat various, but always take care of the portion.
Nothing, there is the phrase of "Sayuna como rey."
I mean, it's lunch as prince and dinner as a mendigo.
I think many people know it.
And health has no listening.
Oh, I can't, there I don't have it.
There it is.
And hunger or worse happened to me.
Sometimes I died of her.
We have four opportunities every day.
To choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthy.
How do I come to obsession?
And telling stories of female scientists.
So I love it, the first one that was obvious to me, Marie Curie.
They gave them a Nobel Prize, they were two.
What is worth its pedestal?
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize.
But they did incredible things.
Well, I learned about the story.
of Ugineia to be tweet.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the Second World War.
They made great contributions.
Among them, the most important thing was that the salt vaccine brought.
It counts on dust in the 50s thanks to her.
Sometimes thousands of lives were saved.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very cool that you could go talk to her.
And do you know what?
In 2011, I was 111 years old.
I've been aware of them recently.
I lost it!
They didn't give an idea to the frightening that that made me know about them recently, very bronze, that's why I tell stories of female scientists.
Or to honor those who left.
But above all.
We lost.
And a lot of time in school learning ortography.
The kids?
They keep losing a lot of time at school.
With ortography.
And why is that?
I want to share with you a question.
That's it!
A new ortography.
And I think so.
What does it need or better?
And I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question nor the answer are new in our language.
But they come rooting from the century in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language.
An Antonio of Nebrijas went into our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
And that's how we have to describe how we say it.
And pronounce how we write.
Each sound had to correspond a letter.
Each letter had to represent a single sound and those that didn't represent any sound.
They should be eliminated.
The criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write.
Second, we pronounce.
It's not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It is, because the Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, has always had a strong resistance to write too different.
And how we say it.
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we would uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided us.
And a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was the etymological one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, Latin, Greek, and so we stayed with Hesmudas, that we wrote, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with velargas and decorations that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the forecastation of the Spanish.
This is how we stayed with Jes.
And that sometimes they are asperous as in people.
And sometimes they sound their birds like in cats, so we stay with ces, feces, marks.
Three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
QD: I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
We all invest large amounts of learning time.
large amounts of that time of plastic and child brain, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules full of exception.
We were transmitted in many forms, implications and explanations.
And the idea that spelling was something fundamental.
One of our training.
However, I have the feeling.
But the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function of spelling?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask yourself that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendental of what you usually believe.
Antography is used to uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and so it's not easier to understand ourselves when we read.
(Laughter) But in contrast with other aspects of language, such as puntuation, for example, in ortography there is no expressive and individual ability involved.
In puntuation.
With puntuation I can choose to change the meaning to a phrase, with puntuation, I can print a particular rhythm.
To what I'm writing, with ortography, no.
Or with ortography or is it good or bad?
Second, don't you add the right standards?
But then, wouldn't it be more likely to simplify the current rules?
For it to be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
Wouldn't it be more sensitive to simplify the current rules?
So that all that time we dedicate to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, do deserve time and effort.
It's not.
Surely!
The ortography is not.
And each one.
Don't write how you want.
Longue is a tool of life.
Therefore, I think it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But he also stood up.
Unfortunately.
Those common criteria are the most.
Complete.
What can it do?
Of course not?
And that's our orthography.
We are not old down.
When does ortography simplify?
It doesn't feel.
Nothing!
It was the quality of language.
Every day with literature to say it from Olo Lego, Agarcilazo, Aservantes, Agongora, what do I see?
What do you write?
Let's see, without H.
Or, sometimes, they write "Scribing with Vecorte."
It is absolutely clear to me.
What's the difference between that?
Are you and ours?
It's a convention.
Or is there still a lack of convention at the time of them?
I mean, but not in quality.
The bad guys!
A key in this story.
I mentioned it for a while.
Is this insistence a little irreflexive?
The teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
Right?
That makes sense.
It's our society.
How does it work?
It's a privilege that allows us to distinguish the blame of broken.
To the educated of the ignorant.
Incredible!
What content?
One of what is being written.
Or you can be able or stop getting a job by a H, who put or stopped putting.
You can become an object of public mockery.
Why once?
It collapsed.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
That throughout the history of our language.
There is always more.
Or individuals related to teaching the first letters.
Those who promoted ortographic reforms.
Those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example.
The launch, along with Andrés Bello, promoted the biggest ortographic reform that had indeed been place.
In the Spanish language, the one from Chile.
In the middle.
In the 19th century.
Why then?
Of those teachers?
To move forward in our ortography I am here.
That's our intimacy to 10,000.
I would like to put some modifications on the table that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's end the Hemula.
Why?
It's a place where we write a House.
Isn't it?
Let's not be anything.
How hard it is?
What kind of sentimental attachment?
Stop!
All the mistakes?
That causes us.
Very good!
Velarga and kiss, we said before.
So, they've never been distinguished in the Spanish language.
Let's choose one.
It can be any, we can discuss.
To sit down, each one will have their preferences.
Not being able to argue.
We see it?
Let's burn the other.
What a boy!
We invite them to functions, to make people burn their soft sound.
Cats, magician, agile.
That the screw turns to the sound "asperó."
Jarabe.
Girafa, people.
It's Argentinian.
What is it?
How are you?
It's an interesting case.
Because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide.
But it cannot be.
It's an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronounce.
And they must take care of each other.
Now I used to say, "Everything is left."
In some places correspond to a sound, in two to two, and in three letters, we lower two.
We're all better.
Some of you?
And these changes may seem a bit tragic.
But they are not that much.
And the real Spanish Academy.
All the tongue gyms also believe that ortography should be modified.
That the language.
It is linked to history, traditions and customs, but also.
It's a practical tool of daily use and that sometimes attachment to history.
To traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
Well, for the use.
Today.
That's it!
What does it imply?
I think our language is much more.
That we know.
What do we have geographic?
How was it historically modified, for example?
We went from orthography, ortography, we went from theater, to theater.
We went out of quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol.
And little by little, now.
Some roofs are starting to be removed in the dictionary of the Academic Real.
Armony, they can write with H.
Or without H.
And we're all fine.
And it also seems to me.
What is this a moment?
And, particularly, the appropriate way to face this discussion.
It's always said.
What does language change?
And it's spontaneously from above.
That are users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
and that authority in some places.
A gym in other places is a dictionary, in other places, it's a ministry.
And a lot of time later, it accepts them and incorporates them.
But only for some levels of language, it's true for the lexic level, for the level of words.
Well, it's less true.
To the gramatic level.
I would almost say that it's not true for the level of ortography that always, historically, changed.
from above to down.
There were always the institutions that focused on the norms.
And they proposed modification.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Hello!
And writing?
He always had a much more restricted and private use than his speaker.
(Laughter) But at that time...
The era of social media.
And that is suffering a revolutionary change.
And he never wrote as much as now.
Why never so many?
They wrote so much to the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time.
We are looking at a large scale.
They were ortographic and innovative uses.
Even people with impecable ortography, hyper-educated, when they write social networks.
It behaves quite similar to how it behaves.
Most users of social networks is to say.
Right?
The ortographic correction and priorizes.
And also speed and efficiency in communication.
For now, there.
There are chaotic uses.
Incredible.
But I think we have to pay attention to it.
Because I probably don't know.
And I'm saying that a time that is assigned to writing to a new place.
Living for that writing.
With new criteria.
I think they would do it.
to reject them.
Let's forget them because we identify them.
As symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, no, I think we have to observe it.
Orden them and encourage them.
In other words, within another norm.
with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose.
etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to keep etymology, it wouldn't be able with ortography.
Besides.
What did we want to learn?
Latin, Greek, Arabic.
with a simplified ortography.
Let's go out!
And to recover etymology at the same place where we are now.
Or étymological dictatorships.
A second objection served from which I gave.
If we simplify spelling, let's leave.
To distinguish between other words that today make a difference.
In just one leth.
I don't know.
But it's not a problem.
Let's see.
Who is the monument?
Who has more than a meaning?
And we don't confuse them the bank where we sit from the bank where we deposit the money, the suit we put of things.
Can you imagine?
Most of the situations, the different context.
I didn't have any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
Incredible, even.
It's the most conmovedor, the one that people say.
I don't want to change.
Well, I educate myself.
customary in this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortography.
Give me your eyes.
This objection is part of each one of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases?
In other words, changes are made in advance, children are taught new rules.
Those who don't want, let us write as we are.
Have you fallen?
And I know?
Until time feels.
And the new rules.
The success of every ortographic reform.
What touch?
Stop.
Prudence.
The consensus, the degree there.
And tolerance.
But we can't let the frightening of old customs.
Today they prevent us from moving forward.
It's the best tribe we can do to the past.
It's improving.
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that academies have to agree.
And cleaning our orthography.
All those habits we use because we receive them.
Although they don't serve us.
All of this is convinced.
What do we do?
Because in the model field.
It's important for language.
Are we going to be letting them go to the next generations?
I made a future.
It wasn't better.
But before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes.
I had the coffee eyes with a achievement around deliris.
And say to myself, "Me too."
Well, I didn't hide from that eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and love.
Well, maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry.
And I felt the need to look at their ashes at the microscope.
Surprising all the scientists I approached me, theyaugurated monocratic images.
The discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
In other words, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy.
She became a father.
This image.
Do you know?
And that's the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And there's another one.
It's the brother of another else, and that's how I could teach you infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection of anything or anyone.
His death, more than an end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life.
In fact, I'm a project.
For me, this teaches me.
Well, that our most pure material essence.
Well, we are accustomed by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror.
There's perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine than a specific principle.
In Argentina.
It hit me.
This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is easy.
Because their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
It's the ability that has the state of innovation.
So, we shouldn't create it.
This is an INBAP of education.
Imagine a public agency.
It designs and content and strategies to transform learning.
And I worked with schools.
To rewrite what classrooms pass.
Which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in high-scale education.
A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers.
Doctors, many of you.
Why should this be blind of short-term political logic?
And the maximum specialists should come.
And to develop a culture.
It's a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
And it's thinking of the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of every year.
But only that way, changes in education.
They won't benefit the highest.
As a scientist, I have been doing experiments for years to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From bigamorphoses.
There are extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemics.
Until fiction became a reality.
And here, now, at home.
So, we stop asking more questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition, even the most ridiculous and worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession could buy pieces of paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Who is an unconscious logic?
In this case, the focus is more focused on intensity than on relevance.
Well, that's it!
It's a bit like the futurist who runs desperately a ball that actually knows she won't reach.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, Chinese Government in only 10 days.
Not only had he found the virus that produced the disease, but he had sequenced his genome and made it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us not being for another principle of human psychology.
It's called "the optimistic blind."
The same here makes many of us handle or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in reality, nothing will happen to us.
It makes the major politicians in Europe and many world's tropicators lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more moral.
Why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up feeling guilty or stubborn.
For example, in the bobonic fishing he added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
In reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a rats cemetery, which were actually spreading the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, masks are useful, especially to avoid people who are already ill with each other.
However, in Japan, everyone falls down.
This first makes people sick and not contagiate and this is very important, but there's another reason, maybe more important, that is that if you only use more caregivers, you know who's sick and who isn't for if you wear or not more affection.
That they use it all over the world.
It's a way of avoiding the stigma and this.
And take care of us all.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we need is motivation to do.
And we've discovered this now for years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change them.
And, however, in three days, all the kids are educated at home.
But we don't know the consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the premature need, and the world keeps going.
Also, of course, change our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started.
West people looked at China with acusatory eyes.
By their predisposition to restring individual liberties, to confin people in their own.
Today what seemed horrible.
That everyone has to stay at home, it seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how our principles can change and how we can adjust them, I would like to be a little experiment.
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of paying attention.
A public council that includes the World Health Organization, but also to govern ourselves and other public sectors has the capacity through some technology, to know where we are, where we move them, to whom we find them.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our transitory load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected and who is not.
Moreover, we assume that this cost can use this information to restrict people's movement in a specific way.
Those who are children and stay home, those who are not risks can go out.
And we keep on this mental experiment.
Imagine that with this we really increase the effect of the epidemic.
It disappears completely, but less people die, and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop economy and the world in a global way.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons, why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that they were a bad use of them.
It's still loyal.
PK: There's nothing.
The question is: If you had the beginning of the pandemic?
And I could choose if you feel good or bad.
What would you do?
Well, I chose this dilemma because I think it's voice to the inevitable attention there is.
On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
Who knows?
Let's see our data a little bit like vaccinating.
It's a concept we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social pact.
To take care of us.
And everything.
A while ago.
With HIV as well, luck leaves freedom, in this case, to sexual freedom, we find a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to reach to feel at the same time free?
And be careful.
Are they going to fly less environments in the sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves?
Will we also realize that taking part of our work is like a public good to take care of all of us?
We don't know.
DB: But, locked up at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think more freely than ever?
What do we want it to be the coral's compreservative sex?
What was the encounter with a fossil?
It was when I was 12 years old.
In a trip.
So we did with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been in museums many times, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
He saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It's an animal I've lived for millions of years.
And that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, like a mind we call it.
They are sea dollars.
They are relatives of sea wounds.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment ...
I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to get it out.
And I discovered something about fossil that I didn't know.
The sea dollar was broken, it fell into the sand.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had begun in the worst way.
PK: But...
Well, I'm interested in fossils, my pobling fascination.
Or those beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me.
We are going to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
But approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist.
But...
The whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I told you about 100 million years old.
What is a number we paleontologists?
That's what we mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000 for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That doesn't enter home.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life.
A amount of time that is really very...
It's very difficult for us.
BB: In our heads.
But well.
Life has made me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I haven't traveled.
QD: Effects and fossil studies from all over the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, South of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but...
It has also led me.
to a very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
We naturally think of these forest landscapes, lagos, close to the Andes mountain.
But for us ...
The palentologists.
GB: Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils.
What are left to be discovered?
Fortunately, we know many dinosaurs from Patagonia, it's one of the best places in the world.
Not to look for dinosaurs.
And most of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia.
They are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call the creptic period.
This is already about 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
And the most common carnivores belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While for that time, in the northern hemisphere.
They added other families of carnivores, like, for example, accidents.
A: Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of South was not surprising, because at that time a big ocean divided and stopped, isolated the continents of the south hemisphere of the hemisphere not.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pange.
And we know very little about what happened at this time, in a juryic.
It's in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs on our planet.
Her key meat specially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time completely dominated the planet.
For the first time they achieved gigantic size, for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the herbivores' niches, carnivores, omnivorous in everything.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues studying.
Businessmen and scholarships.
Explain.
Or the rocks of the Patagonia's Law.
And that leads me.
To one of the stories.
And it's in the discoveries we were able to do.
This is the last blood.
But we found it four years ago.
In hills like these, walking.
A very heat afternoon.
And after walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw a few meters away, something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I approached as I approached.
It was becoming more clear.
Yes, what it was.
It was the trail of a dinosaur.
And I got closer.
I stopped next to me, I shooled.
And I was really held.
I asked myself what it was and at the same time I knew what it was.
Yes, after studying years.
It was made of bones, anatomy, dinosaurs.
Effectively, it was the back part.
It was from a meat dinosaur now.
But really?
But I couldn't believe it.
Did you know it was one of those discoveries that happen?
There are very few times in life.
[A.DE.]
To warn the rest of the team?
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it.
After several days we were able.
Or cover it with bones of bones, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was already over.
We didn't count on the team or time, it was necessary to seem a big excavation and we had to go back to the museum.
And until the next season the winter came.
It was a year, long, waiting, until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
And to see if there was something else, it was only the skate we had found.
Or there were more preserved remains.
After that long year, the first day.
It's from the station.
And we realized that the complete skeleton of this dinosaur was there.
5:1pm. Me: "Thank you."
Very good!
In the dinosaurs' findings, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal.
Ah, he was dead.
To the beachs of a lake and it has been covered by endless bars, preserving in an intact way.
That's it.
And that's where excaution begins.
Their skiping layer, layer, those sediments that were burning.
It's a very emotional moment, for the first time it's.
I was returning to the surface, an animal.
I was living in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
And the animal had to have died, it had to be covered by sediment strings that kept gathering up to 2 meters and meters.
So they captured the follower, and that food was transforming.
Or in sedentary rocks.
In that same process bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
And then all that package of buried rocks.
So he had to rise to the surface due to a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a raise.
Well, of all this block.
And then the rain and the wind had to start erosity.
And start discovering.
The layers that contained this dinosaur, in the same summer that we were walking those mistakes.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering the judges is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours and hours under the sun.
The pathologic wind, that doesn't lose.
And then we could carry it.
All this rest protected by bones tiles to the lab.
In the lab, the museum starts another stage.
It's extremely long, it's where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain from grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's where we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we could see.
Well, this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
Studying anatomy.
Well, from these rests what we saw.
It was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor.
Of the abelizens, of those carnivores of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery proved to us that this family had originated about 100 million years before.
And that's what they thought.
Much before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere they divided, being due to a big ocean, at the time of fire, when all the continents were united in a big supernight.
Now, not all discoveries follow this trajectory.
Because we really do some discoveries in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, of some rocks like these that were transported.
Until the museum knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing.
We arrived inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We went to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was content in those role blocks.
The challenge was quite complete?
And I was containing a very well preserved crane and with very strange teeth.
You laugh in the form of hand and that's why we call this dinosaur "maning".
For this dinosaur is also very special.
It's for something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is...
It's a replica of the podium of this dinosaur.
This is a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 cm from the tip of the head to the end of the queue.
And this meth of a dinosaur didn't look like any other way.
We contract or knew about the northern hemisphere.
Studying their remains we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient times.
And this was not so surprising.
But if you see on the South Africa and Patagonia were very close to each other in this time of foreign.
The Atlantic Ocean still hasn't been formed yet to these two continents today.
But once again, we had a case.
Of restricted animals, the only ones from the South Hemisphere and that had nothing to do with those of the hemisphere.
We started to find other cases.
So, what did they adjust to this pattern?
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived in this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us.
That is, the environments of this time.
Ridying climate models, what we see is that right now...
From Pangea, where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic, that posted the existence of a great right one.
Or in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big equatorial desert.
It was a great way what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve.
independent and completely separated from the faines of the northern hemisphere.
That's it!
The lack of water.
That's what I had isolated those.
These vaccines were not a desert full of water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs.
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy.
But we've really told ourselves fantastic, fansifascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of what the body size is in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It's what makes us understand.
The chapters like this is the history of the planet.
And we, the pentologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
The rocks.
They were formed for millions of years.
It's our plan.
When?
Good afternoon!
To animals.
And the plants that lived in him.
They had stayed while they were formed.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of websites.
Scrites over 4.5 billion.
And life.
I listen to a place prepondering.
In this story, in the last 3800.
That millions of pages still to read this book.
What if we really want?
To know our planet.
Cystems, ecosystems, the problems we're seeing nowadays.
It's important to know its story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Audience: Yes!
But it's also key.
Respect.
A future.
Tico.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and they would watch so many movies.
I dream of healing.
And contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of...
to defend small terrible and invasive villages.
Then, time.
They are not real bathrooms.
You lost the subway and you don't have the magic ball of Harry Potter.
Sometimes empires without standing small villages and you don't have the position of patterns to defend them.
But something of that childhood vocation remained in me and almost without realizing it.
But I dedicated myself to looking.
And try to understand how these superpowers work.
What is my imagination?
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas.
To develop one of the main superpowers.
Maybe?
It's the most important thing in this situation that we have to live.
And what is the superpower to think better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others.
And this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea I'm going to tell you about.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor fixed.
but it can be development.
Pooling our mind with it.
Power and practicing ideas.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others.
Think about something.
A: The first one.
Imagine you enter a gym.
Look.
That they make the floor.
Besides these rings, fix bicycles.
A: Do you get a half-turn?
They go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three months of lines from Manteque and Serako.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body improved.
There it is!
And I started, less.
It doesn't count to think.
Five is to think.
And we have to practice, think.
They develop us the habit of finishing.
Well, and we take the time.
Very good!
In intelligence it's not something you have or you don't have.
It's something that's used or not.
And I know one.
And does the saying say?
Who only sees a bottle?
That now, who only has a bottle sees in all the problems as a cloud.
But if we have to remove a torn, a hammer is useless.
And not to take into account of his slave.
If we have a torn, we need a defeat.
And if we need to cut something, we need a brain.
It was a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
And the tools of mind are called "Mental Mental Memen".
If we only have a mental model?
We can think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get 2,000 out of an human being.
Or if we have many mental models.
Well, our mind is much more powerful.
But where are those mental models, where do they get them from?
And when you find yourself in different disciplines, in different places, with no different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
There are mental models in the old Egypt three,000 years ago before Christ.
In other words, in the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better we have to broaden the box of tools in our heads.
A: Yes, no.
Well, all the problems will be worried to us.
Not long ago, I was at the club and at the table on the side, a man told his friends about his son's soccer teacher.
Do you see his son and his classmates?
For a mistake the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told him something.
There's the Sun.
But it didn't realize.
Of what?
Or by saying this.
I was causing a much bigger evil.
In his child.
He was letting him like a bone in front of his friends.
And he was detegitiming the teacher.
To the front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning on a scale.
You don't have success on that scale.
And without knowing it.
We do things that make us lose in other most important scales.
And having a discussion.
And lose friendship, for example.
Get silver, try freedom, or win freedom and lose love.
When we act, let's think about what scale it impacts.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think?
How to act?
And the beginning taught us that the essentials invisible the eyes.
Sometimes the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the pressure generates emotion.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
Or a lot of data came to China's situation.
But those acts didn't generate impression.
And they generated emotions.
And they didn't make us act.
When they began to come images of Italy, a country that we feel more family and similar than China.
Those expressions generated emotion, fear.
And fear generates action, that we are all now stored preventively what we are seeing.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone like us happened before.
But many times...
And it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
Is it the practice to anticipate?
It's what distinguishes us with the modern civilization of prehistorics.
"Casting is one thing."
Do you feel hungry?
You fail?
You have an immediate reward.
You eat what to get married.
But very different farms.
Do the effort now for something you're going to take advantage of within six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
To prevent us, it creates applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a policeman.
But it saves lives.
And we develop our ability to act before we feel.
That is to say, to develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills of thinking well.
And let's think of a million.
What do we have to anticipate?
And now?
That we still feel, we don't see.
Of whom?
But we all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last a month, it's very sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 km, for example.
By km 9 we are exhausted.
And if we programmed to run 20.
By km 9 we are impecable.
We do a culte of resilience.
But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever happened to you that you met an acquaintance in a very trouble place?
Are you walking through a little town in the middle of the ship?
A high school classmate who wouldn't do it 15 years ago.
You can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
Finding that colleague, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But, as we know so many people.
And that is very likely.
To find someone in a very unlikely place.
A: In fact.
It happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same. Are there so many unlikely things?
It is very likely that something very unlikely happens to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the unlikely is impossible, and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future.
We don't know what will happen.
And not now, my field with more normal times.
We have to learn to live with meaning.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
And it always leaves many open doors.
Not thinking only about the most likely and find ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
There's no way to do serious things.
Although they are very probable.
What if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have the car with Nasta's tank?
Contestals, why once?
You found yourself in a village on the other side of the world.
With a high schoolmate who wouldn't see that sequence.
In other words, at the beginning I guided the zero of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being thirsty.
To the facts of ideas that make us change our way of thinking.
AV: And of people.
With which we cultivate those ideas.
Or power of people that enrich.
It's a way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
An interview Borges 40 years ago, the interview asked me a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewee told me, "That's what you answered to me."
This same question four years ago.
Well, that's it.
I don't know what happened.
Doming?
And he said: "I apologize."
And it hasn't had much time to think about this issue for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limited moment in our lives.
To be in account of new ideas.
Of the new ideas that are emerging and always being open.
Let's change.
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to emotional sport.
But that's why they need the cost of a male, the rational of the family.
At the beginning of your lives?
They will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will get a good husband they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
From a manual?
For the education of girls and young people.
It was about marriage.
While it was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, it was one of every 19:30.
But the idea itself.
And it has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, at all times.
In 1915 no country in the world women could vote.
(Laughter) In 2015 that means today, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
In 1910 Marie Curie.
And he won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
But...
The French science academy said he didn't have merit.
What do you feel to do academic?
And the first woman in France.
who entered science academy in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here had already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school.
In 1925, 50 years ago, we're celebrating that.
But she let a woman be the master's.
At Yale University, they admired women just in 1970.
The University of Princeton just in 1974, and we could go on and on.
Well, that was it.
This idea.
that women are only useful to create children.
And...
That helps your husband.
And that is an irraational being.
What a cisteric?
And it was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time.
And almost all of them taking 5,000, maybe.
But they thought that this idea.
But it was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living.
The astonising mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, is a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived in economics, if you are nothing beside this.
We are putting aside the idea that the truth is.
So, it's true.
To the idea that truth is a lie.
And there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem.
Or neurobiologists, now.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this.
Or we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not everyone.
In other words, not the main world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that facts don't exist.
There are only interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretative framework, what is today?
September 24th.
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we've convinced it's on September 24th, because all we're here agreed with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreu, Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more they exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every aspect we put is part of a very hard social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
And cats live without calendaries.
My dog sticks to the accelerator, and who is this world alone at home?
No, making a damn.
But I didn't know the time, I knew it had become again.
Well, he doesn't look at the clock.
But if human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That would be a little more stimulation, but surely the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
And she looked at me rolling.
He wrote the law of gravity: What a genius!
But that's not how ideas arise.
And ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
I would have missed the trips he made, met the animals he saw, everything he had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
And...
It's about discussing the investigations accumulated over 500 years through the diffusion of books and printing, in the 14th century, there wasn't even the print.
It doesn't matter how great a man can do if he doesn't have the context, he can't think of an idea.
In other words, wisdom, geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what generates it.
The theory of evolution could only have been born in the 19th century, with never been born.
But if it was born, it was born in the 19th century.
And the same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now.
What we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation.
They are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that facts don't exist, there are only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political, and social field.
That is, revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women have been.
Those who took care of the house and created the children.
Nevertheless.
And in less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
Half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women, look at all the creative energy that humanity has lost.
To think about the way women were not useful for anything else than cleaning ladies.
How many medicines, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
I mean, wrong ideas are monsters.
There's an idea.
We can do it.
Following because it was created a century and a half ago and that model was created to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, "But how, the Greeks, the Romans, the Pingues, and all those things."
And relationships between them.
People of the same sex, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you today, have always existed, in every culture, at every time.
That is, they are even documented in many animal species outside the human.
But it had never been thought that the sexuality of a person.
Not bad, as it was called at that time.
No, no, no.
Now, how was a person totally created, sexual identity was created?
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Vitoriana, who was one of the great forms of social control over a century.
It's stronger than there, because the same thing as turning into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it proibdes to something we want to do.
(Laughter) "Don't masturbate."
(Laughter) You'll do it guilty, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to be guilty.
It's not true, fault is a big control.
Great!
Don't you say?
The woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
Isn't it?
I mean.
It will give you fault, it will give you fault, and even if it gives you fault, you do it.
Isn't it?
And so that's a terrible social control form because it dominates us.
Well, incredibly!
On the one hand, do you know we can't leave, as if they were deprived of me?
We can't stop eating, that's why we are all the same.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there.
Hosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world.
They don't have the right to talk.
My right to stand up, the same as women before.
Isn't it?
Or I judge him.
Or that blacks, without salt from slavery, don't even speak when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of sexual loved ones, it also changed the situation of black people, it also changed the situation of Jews, in some of the situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free and in a much more tolerant environment than a century ago.
What 50 years ago, what 20 years ago?
It's been 10 years ago.
The homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't even have the right to donate blood, this is just getting up now.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
To be exhausted.
But in many parts of the world today they are completely legal. This was possible for the paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all oppressed ones.
Spread your identity.
Now, respect each other and then make others understand that they are also human beings with a full right.
But there's a drama of social struggles.
And you have to get into jail that discriminated me.
(Laughter) To be respected as a Jew, I have to be just a Jewish.
To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman.
So that they respect me as black, only black, and the same as gay.
And the gays, women, Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people.
And maybe I don't want to cost as a man, what do I know?
I said, "No."
However, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
From prison.
What 50 years ago?
Look how old sun is.
I was a homosexual boy.
But I didn't know what it was to be a homosexual child.
Mom!
I didn't know the homosexual word and they didn't even say to me like this: "My schoolmate told me, "Sure, let's go."
"Sure, don't look at me."
I didn't even know what it was to be trophy, nor gordopologist, or homosexual.
Nothing!
And at the same time?
I knew that caused rejection, that was something I had in me.
I didn't know what it was.
And I returned home, from school.
And I saw that my father, who loved it.
He looked at me.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so bad for someone to come out?
Look!
I had to learn what it was to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual.
So I had to insist on being homosexual.
Let's assume the identity there is.
Have a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world.
With translator, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual.
We are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person, saying that I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay 24 hours, that we have to escape identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea that was having.
Or that it arises from understanding that there are no facts that exist.
interpretations.
There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it, we are contradictory.
There are no facts, there are contradictions, and contradictions are also interpretations.
What do the facts exist?
This means that interpretations exist, that I was put into a jaula, they got me in a place.
I had to accept staying there to defend myself and now I want to leave, I said.
And when I faced it.
Because when an idea is incarnated, it's that it doesn't move, while we have it only in our heads it's not useful.
And I made her body.
I left prison.
And I left my house.
Is there a marvel?
Did you think what prison it is?
What is exceptional?
It's not like that.
To do that?
To those who are not there.
DB: Yes, it's true.
Why live constantly with this house?
Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
It doesn't have the things we need.
And if I had the things I needed.
Exploring is difficult.
terrifying.
Each personal and place are completely different.
The constant movement leads us extraordinary situations.
At one point.
In the long or worse.
full of confusion, where a storm stays and everything you know how to disappear.
When everything I did, I've erased by someone else's voices, you, I'm not even in microbes.
To double the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts than the obstacles.
And once you say it, once you get to get rid of your words, an avalanche of ideas that live towards you at all speed.
Each of these ideas seems a bomb that seeks to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain and you are chosen.
It opened your paraguas and cover it from there.
Or to do one side and in part with each one of them.
Every moment is a combination of energy, of following, of returning, jumping, or copying.
But learning to achieve this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement.
A class is not quite bad, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that each moment needs and that, even though life controls music, the movements believed them.
These are movements that take moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep in words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
Remember that maybe it's not like that.
Thank you!
But they will allow you to revive the exact way in which these stars are seen.
The formula I saw that face when I spoke about what I liked the most, the speed was the one that went to your heart.
Or how did you break when you spoke about that voice, that forest that you know so much, that knows that you're probably looking for something that you lost?
DB: That voice.
Your best friend, you're always there.
So, the first one to stand up, the first one to give you a little puzzle to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that list to jump for you when you need it.
Why is that?
He told me: "My friend."
A microphone?
Why water?
A notebook, a dance class and a better friend, without that, yes, if it's not a moviemaker, I cannot survive.
What we created in City.
Yes, it's funny.
And once we chose.
I mean, the opportunity to get out.
Very good, thank you!
I didn't manage a stable job either, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
S: Yes.
There it is.
It always appears onstage.
A person you'll see is already in year.
It's good.
And with a lady, wake up her experience, but totally.
They come to remind us that the past was better.
It really does this.
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer it.
To think about this?
I unfortunately remember my friends all my life.
And Juancho, Franco and Emanuel.
(Laughter) These photos you're seeing there.
(Laughter) It's from 2009 when I live in high school.
PK: What can I say to my friends?
Because I love them a lot.
(Laughter) What are my brothers?
And they are three people super capable.
That, as they didn't count on the necessary resources as to be able to stay like to be able to study what they liked.
They stayed in each city.
AC: And be surprised.
Until today.
They can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
As for me, what is the port in this picture?
The mark of the absence of opportunities also became present, my parents, who are workers.
And they made an effort on human beings that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew I didn't know if they stayed here in the city.
I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be with all opportunities.
Well, maybe some of you wondered why are these things happening?
Audience: Great!
Well, in full 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and progress are with a speed that surprise us all.
(Laughter) And borders collapse and barriers that exist between people.
And in this context?
And the cities to make more and more important tales.
Let's be honest, it's our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68 percent of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more people choose to live in cities...
And it means that this is where we have a greater chance to progress.
What explains in two schemes?
(Laughter) While weapons seem to stay in time.
Others make progress, they're vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
Here I'm going to tell you a key word, that you want them to keep and argue.
When they come out with that door, to return home.
What?
Strategy!
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
I'm talking about my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships.
It happens precisely for him.
To connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminated manner, but sitting on our strengths, our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) Now you may ask me: How do you see all this beautiful thing I'm telling you in real life?
Through complex processes.
Because it improves the quality of life of the population.
(Laughter) It drives migration to other places in search of a better future.
Once again inevitably.
I remember them, my friends.
OK?
(Laughter) It's a photo a few months ago, so you can see a couple of things.
Why start?
In short, a fifth friend Ameo Vieira.
Do you know what it is?
No, he was drinking something.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of proportional investment relationship is given.
As it improves the quality of the photos of the phones.
No, what we were in it, we were going to improve.
(Laughter) Does anyone have a couple of jokes in addition?
(Laughter) And we have to receive the fight.
AC: But...
Do you know what we share until today?
And beyond the deep hackeism we have each other.
The mark of the lack of opportunity.
Franco, for example, who is also that.
Why?
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2012.
I see nationality.
(Laughter) But today, even if you want to detect a geography teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be on Monday students working, simply to be able to live.
AC: Then...
They are hungry?
What's the one on my left?
(English) The bathroom is their place.
(Laughter) How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to enter one of the security forces in the best country?
But since I didn't count on this possibility here, then we are changing career without being able to find what was really passionate to him.
And I can't even get a job that allows some economic independence.
(Laughter) Finally, they are manuals.
(Laughter) It's a computer genius, but genius don't know.
In life, anything.
(Laughter) But then?
The whole day working in his place that built from the ship.
He goes to college to study programming.
And you can't develop your potential and continue learning what you like.
Because it doesn't count all the necessary tools.
(Laughter) For lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
Why?
We, as young people, don't have...
PK: Nothing you don't know!
No less than the rest of the world, absolutely.
That's it!
Recently in English, I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 young homes at the world.
(Laughter) In order to participate in a weekend, in New Delhi, the INPS's capital.
I left Argentina's representation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
The thing is to say it was an incredible experience, that is, my head fell off.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I'd like to share with you, it's like this.
ME: In my one?
There are millions.
You will never be able to say this with sufficient emphasis so that you can understand, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
(Laughter) For all tastes and colors.
Great!
You have to be discouraged to find them, the sun doesn't come.
And in one of the two.
(Laughter) But not less important.
Our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I have nothing to forget about the youth, nor the Chinese, nor anyone.
Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
What do you want?
And I've been here to come out to the world and bring opportunities to them to act to develop.
MA: Once again.
(Laughter) We want better cities.
We act strategically to the world.
Remember?
(Laughter) When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, I found myself to go to study.
And with three days to turn 18.
They were good!
It doesn't have a result, with a lot of fear.
This can never be found in public.
(Laughter) Because it's very difficult.
And all those surrounding me know for all those I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city.
What is your home?
(Laughter) It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
And until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
Why is this?
I don't have to go to taste.
And my friends?
Nobody knows it!
No, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
Finally, who's the most beautiful?
And keep wings to the city that would come to do you.
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine how brilliant.
No, what would have been crazy?
If we had been able to completely dedicate geography.
Why?
If today they were in one of the security forces in our country.
Or to not go so far than Manuel.
If I had the necessary programs to keep on going to what it was.
Is it true?
Thank you!
Ah, yes!
AC: You see the lack of a short film.
Yes!
No, all this.
What do I want to tell you?
It doesn't seem to be enough argument.
Do you want another example?
That's fine.
DB: This is it!
PK: What is tattoo?
She tells me when, finally.
Please stand up.
(Laughter) It's the unique depression.
And in Africa?
Why have to go?
DB: Two suicide attempts.
DB: It's innumerable.
DB: Those psychological ones?
Very good!
Much, a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop passing.
We have to come out strategies.
In the sun!
(Laughter) We don't get a final point.
Thank you very much.
I'm a surgeon.
Since always, the surgeons.
We thought that to have more work.
Well, we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in the last 10 years.
It was my research.
Well, in my case, in the sofa.
It was based on it.
Or to search for it?
Now, the reasons.
To operate less and less patients.
And that?
We can do it in several ways, for example, looking for genes.
To detect early diseases, like cancer.
And so we don't have to operate it.
Can we?
To help tissues to repair.
Well, by themselves alone.
By using their own ability to regenerate.
Let's see this.
Well, we do it.
With biological platforms, which are like a map.
What do we give them?
Not to the tissue.
To use their own ability.
But we have to restore after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope.
to make procedures.
and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate this task.
DB: What happened before.
It seemed like science fiction, today.
It's almost daily.
Alucinan.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
[A.DE.]
To have more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction.
What about me?
And a lot of patients.
Well, that they avoided.
Not having to become a surgery.
Well, with all this I told you, I realized.
that developing methods, increasingly less invasive.
[A.DE.]
Well, every time.
Sharing.
No reflection.
About what can mean a collective culture.
At a moment like this.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese.
And in my work for many years I've had contact with questions.
BB: Literary.
Sociology and anthropological culture of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and answers.
Special and individuals of the Japanese society.
They can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's going to ask us a first question.
Why, Japan?
He could avoid the biggest impact of the contagium.
If it was in January, the first case happened.
We were so close to China.
There were almost 130 million inhabitants in a very reduced space.
Moving from the population of the third age in the world.
Going back to the second country with more smokers.
For the number of inhabitants.
Why in Japan the infection of this virus?
It has not had an exponential growth.
but an advance.
GG: Great!
And the identified one.
Until now.
But we know that this new virus chron is very contagious.
In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail.
What would allow a great propagation of the disease?
Many people, in little place and a room.
For those people, with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in a way.
It answers organicly and united to any event that compromises her.
Japan passed through war.
Picks, their name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
A thousand earthquakes per day.
Generation, transgenation.
He had to overlleve catastrophs.
MMS: Natural?
It is generated by man.
We can think of this with something that really likes Argentines.
The team went for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day.
It has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained.
that has no infrastructure and has to go out to improvise.
And the directives?
We are social distancing.
And hygiene and individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or in its own home.
The Japanese population has not established.
It's been hundreds of years ago.
You don't need to say no to embrace yourself.
And not give a kiss.
Because they don't do it.
It is greet with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect.
And most workers in public spaces use gloves.
You don't need to recommend to get rid of your shoes, when you enter home, because it's already customary.
And we don't have to indicate it is not to storm or storm on someone else.
Because this is a habitual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, years ago studies show.
What more than 50% of Japanese?
You will use board when you feel cold.
And not to protect yourselves.
I said, "Yes, to protect others."
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good at all.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They did two Western teachers.
In a school in Japan.
You'll surely know the game of the chair.
It puts music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants.
And they are taking one out of one.
In each round.
This experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, stayed all behind.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win.
One when another suffers.
The Japanese word loves this way of being.
It's about having the confidence that the other will take care of me.
In resonance, allow us to perform when we take care of others.
There's a child in the example.
But we can already see how a collective society works.
If it helps itself.
Because every immigration contributes to the good of everyone.
