We are Chéos, we do our profile at the end of Campion Churchills.
There's the instrument brought by lands, distant and music, orchestra.
The Chinese?
In the room with patios... We had a vision, a butcher's button and the instrument we go, the main character, to do.
In our popular music, why do we change the way we play it?
So you sound like a folklore and you can dance.
A city-privile Milion lives in Neuquia.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
And the beginning we had to learn to work on guitar, it's called by video, each one recorded their part.
That's how the other point falls over and that's how we shout the repertoire.
Let's go with this mouse.
Very good!

(Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Well, we don't even go to what Marso Piangers is.
It's the second frequency.
So, close my eyes.
And the relatives of those who didn't recover.
What this time?
I take it with my hand.
They wake up to see a stance.
(Audience 5) Yes!
But there's another new thing in this pandemic.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the content of social networks and fighting misinformation.
We were already seeing and worried about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there was already in Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global levels of overwhelming.
And it's in my bone.
The pandemic, COVID-19, is the first pandemic that lives with infodevia.
What is that, what information am I doing?
The WHO, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice to spread fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
(Sigh) And he called it like rooting it.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
(Sigh) misinformation is always dangerous.
When we know, but when it comes to health issues it is much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can put in danger, is our lives directly.
(Sigh) You don't know anything about the amount of waste.
To circulate these days on Facebook, on Instagram.
And you, on Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they bet without a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
Great!
(Laughter) Four weeks ago, with my team, we worked.
without resting, cheating.
I have fake news.
A winner, truths in half.
They circulate over this new disease, but they know what we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of that information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes it's frustric.
(Video ends) That's why I think it's useful to tell you something we discovered, something we found.
All the contents.
In COVID-19.
You can fit.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
I believe that by telling them, they will be more prepared.
And they are more prepared, maybe they can help, to stop this avalanche of disinformation on us: The four categories are simple, the first has to do with that.
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
The cooperative theories that say that a pioneering act of two Chinese scientists stepped them in Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
None of this is true, if you see content linked to a theory that humans created this virus.
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus contains that spread.
A wrong reading in a scientific study of a Pepper that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not the case, there's no evidence of that.
The third category is related to fake news.
Girls and jury are the most dangerous, it's the one that has to pay more attention, the one that has to force us to be more careful.
It's not true that taking hot water with lemon we kill albums and making garbage with hot water and salt or making vapor is drop to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
There's no Cuban land.
That he was able to generate it and there was no Argentinian who already discovered the saving vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications, but at the moment it doesn't have a fully satisfying answer.
The fourth category of misinformation relates to false measures, not farther in Argentina, the day the preventive and mandatory social isolation was expelled, 15 days ago, a little more, a false of credit that said that the quarantine started at three in the afternoon of that day, or at the reach of different measures to the disposal of the authorities.
And it obviously generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you cross paths with, who say you'll fall on the Internet, not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that not only we'll be locked up in our homes, but also communicators.
Deinformation is in general.
They try to generate panic.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source like the World Health organization or the Ministry of Salud unfies.
Before I finish ...
I want to tell you something else we learned, those who dedicate us, check, check.
(Laughter)
We're not good.
No doubt.
We're not comfortable.
When we lack certainty.
Audience: Yes.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask your favor, if you receive a content, it's not checking.
Don't share it.
Let's replace comparison with doubts.
It's so common:
I don't share my doubts.
That's Swiss care.
(Sigh) If you receive a content.
Of someone and cover what's wrong.
Please raise your sheets.
How did he turn around?
Enjoy me salt and with affection.
And if you share a content and then you realize that it's false.
Please raise your sheets.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not stupid, but alive.
Science works intensely to get the cure, dynamic pandemic, infectologists, sanitarists, workers all the time, there are changes every day.
It requires time.
While there are evidence and information vaccines.
We have to be able, maybe as never before tolerating that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those brickets with blue content.
Because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we will be much worse than tolerate them.
(Applause)
23 years ago.
that I work to accompany people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I learned to work in the midst of pain and other people.
It doesn't make you a bitter, nor sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches us to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If we can't see a miracle in a reconnection act.
Of sorry?
of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool.
that allows you to do a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
insecurity and fear.
that generate the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty, to be more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
And when despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
And there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more atterces than ours.
And that allows you to put your own problem into perspective.
Finally, I learned and I continue learning.
That it's not just about healing.
Above all, is it about relating?
And to accompany.
Cultivating love and compassion help face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Cultivate love and compassion.
They can leave a path of transcendence so that others can travel.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
I turned 40 years ago.
After writing several novelas, I wanted to write about more personal topics.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that I would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, about my female condition.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman like me?
Do I have to decide good night, I'm a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
KA: I had a lot to start my research on women's condition.
It was a topic already written in many articles.
Feminity is missing, feminity is going to disappear.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But, in the end, what is feminity?
We can remember approximately that half of humanity is men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity is manliness and the other half is feminity. So why are we asked to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
When I was 30, would they have told me I was going to write a book about women's condition?
I would have surprised, maybe angry.
At 40.
I am really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time, it was so ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations to a man.
We just have to go on the street to see that humanity is divided into two groups.
who walk differently, who dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I started my research on listing all beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes of these myths.
I studied biological, physiological issues.
Psychologists.
Technological ones?
No man had ever thought of analyzing the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
It's not in case man is everything, in most languages, man is both the positive side as the neutral side, man is humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women?
It's the other, the other.
Women.
The second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It wasn't defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity.
That it's all.
So I kept doing my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization many times there are groups of excluded.
Excrued as blacks.
Excrites like Proletaries or Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They say, "We identify each other."
However, women...
They don't identify themselves easily.
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman will identify themselves more easily with a white name?
Because with a black woman.
A funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
That with a projectionary.
Women are not a community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live disperse within the group of men.
Anything, the man.
It is quite satisfying to believe and feel the king of creation.
Actually, the vifeminists!
Did they work?
Teories in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions.
Many men usually ask me.
Do you think that because it's a woman?
Of course, as if there were a few or a uterus and the rule and hormones would take me any objectivity.
Well, as if they wrote their own...
Teorías.
They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
So, what do I want?
(Laughter) It's conscious about these differences and understanding them.
Sharing what I understood.
(Laughter)
Sharing what I understood about why women behave differently from men.
(Audience) Yes!
And within all that I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Audience: Good evening.
Is nature like that?
Society doesn't dictate, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
A woman is not born.
It gets to be done.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I immediately became a writer.
At the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds, it was a complete, integrated individual.
It's integral.
Many women remain in their feminity because men explain that it's very natural for her.
Don't you think about it?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Possau.
To have children, devote yourself to creating them.
Men explains that everything is natural to him, therefore.
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, there's a lot.
What I do intend.
Are we aware of it?
To recognize these differences.
And aware that you can make decisions.
With free will.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman.
And every man.
He can and must decide what he wants for his sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to conscientize.
That this is effort.
It has to be done together.
Between men.
"Women."
What I want is to conscientize.
That when it's the second sex.
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
Well, we will live in a whole society.
The powerful one is.
It's made of men and women that are completely complete and free.
Thank you!
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause) Good afternoon, I guess you have studied for today, you surely know the taste, which is a hell in search of freedom, or a hell that talks about the thoughts that thoughts go like golden wings on mountains and colors.
And at the end she says, "And these thoughts for them to give them?"
To suffering, value.
It's something that Verdi wrote, supreted searching for more than 100 years and we can take it as his own.
They are all ready, up too, right?
(Laughter) Breathe now, surely you're already breathing at home, but now...
Or that I know you, now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) "Thank you, love, love, love, woman, love, love, woman, love, woman, love, woman, love, love, woman, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, God."
(Applause)
(Applause)
A couple of years ago.
A group of my friends went out to marry for the abortion legalization.
I asked my other, and to be able with them.
And my mom told me that no, that in any way, I was very young to be there alone, that scared of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
If you don't want to go with them, I accompanied my voice, that I wouldn't steal a walk from the Funkini's time, and my mother came with me to Congreso.
I still remember his face when we got there.
Let's look around and he told me with a smile and a big surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
Yes!
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, going out for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, the Nárnica chronics.
What are the stories of my generation?
In all there are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And there are teenagers in all.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
Audience: Yes!
I'm not surprised at all, so the attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a distopy.
Because it's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our heads in an a terrifying distopy like that of climate change.
Where we, young people, are going to pay the bill.
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where you do a death bag.
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni (Applause)
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives, in the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
Sometimes my friends or my family criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobos comments.
Or by discussing political things, I believe there are certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a relative of mine makes a macho comment ...
I'll discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or abortion legalization?
I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion and I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that, opinion, is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
And to resguard our present.
I hope that more and more we start to see markets and political spaces in general, not as dangerous as it scares.
but as a space for personal and social growth.
From union and inspiration and I hope there's always, but always, there's always a place for teenagers.
And to be able to look proudly and say without any surprise.
It's full of kids.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours each day carrying a wall like this?
To take water to your house?
Wow!
(Audience) Yes!
(Audience) Yes.
Can you imagine that the water inside was so polluted, had this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face in the future.
This is how the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended every day by the climate action for water, a couple of days ago in more rocks.
Water is life, and without it we wouldn't exist, in fact, human beings, we are composed by more than 65% of water.
Despite that, every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, main lakes.
Through agriculture.
From the livestock of our big companies and even from our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
A thousand children a day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world.
This means that if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
Very good!
Of that amount of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America and if we think about it, it is somehow paradoxical.
Because this continent has 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, which, for example, Peru, sorry, is the octave country with largest hydric reserves in the world, has at least 30 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, Mr. Trump, now wants to build a wall, that stops even more in these two countries.
Almost 20 million people, that is, around 20 percent of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
(Laughter) These are all these numbers that were looking back made us wonder how is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth is found in front of this situation.
thousands of people in Latin America, from Mexico to Peru.
Sunding like this, from Guatemala doesn't arrive.
Let's make the luck that we have indeed had, to play where we were born and, above all, we've caressed with a tremendous desire to return it throughout a window I've given the self-caravar to call the white wound.
We went into the adventure.
During the way we were going to find rural communities and rubbish communities that rarely have water at home.
All of them go to rivers, poths or marantials.
To be able to see.
But always with a common problem.
(Laughter) The water and this pinete is contaminated.
All these communities usually have three ways to purify the cat.
Living it, crying or buying it directly.
So, as you can see, it implies a huge cost of resources for people who almost don't have age.
Money resources to buy these subsidies or time resources to go pick up the fire and then go away.
And we asked ourselves.
What can we do to help solve this problem?
From the basis that none of us were experts in the matter, we put our hands to the play.
And after many weeks of research we found a system.
from filtration by membrals that was perfectly adapted.
To the logistics of our project, but above all, to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works practically like...
It's a strainer.
Great!
Wow!
The contaminated water goes through the child.
And this contains all the largest particles than with a water molecule... (Laughter) leaving only going through clean water, retaining in 99% of all these substances so damaging about health.
(Laughter) (Applause) It's a real system that is the most efficient to carry clean water immediately, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider that it's only the water weight to make the myth work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these filters in the lives of all these people?
(Laughter) Well, and now?
It's Leo's story, Leocruz is a 21-year-old boy, we want to tell you a story.
It belongs to October 15th colony in Trinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but unfortunately, both he and all his poplars, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which he was supported, was very polluted by stakeptical stages around him.
At our march, Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride that it was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well: We delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people: Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, in Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua.
You will have access to drinking water for about 10 years, and now thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago, when Guatel Vancolera was an idea.
Well, we realize a little of the dream we've had the opportunity to live, right?
But in this dream we were never alone, but in this dream we were never alone, before leaving, more than 400 people brought their gota through a crowdfunding campaign which was destined to 100% to the exclusive compass of the water filters.
(Laughter) And nine months later, fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
(Laughter) Together we have created a social movement that has made the trip of these four friends.
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
(Laughter) But there's still a lot, there's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
So, we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question of how is it possible to be one of the risks of the greatest risks in which human beings are facing in the next 10 years, according to world economic supplement, which is not that we say it.
The reason for having reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We have created a lot of necessities that we all know are unnecessary, that sometimes we don't think of what other people suffer, so that we can fulfill all of them.
We have seen this project with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
where we've seen how large embotellers were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were completely taking their entire access to water.
So, what do you think, for example, that they are doing for those lands, the great oil producers, the great oil oil purposes?
So that all of us can fill our vehicles' deposit.
What they are doing here is polluting, it's destroying forests and rivers of communities or or the Amazon rivers, we've been there and it's amazing, they are making the communities have to be displaced.
And in the future, this will likely cause is that it disappears until its culture.
Why not?
It's really incredible and living it hasn't given us something that is open.
(Laughter) Actually, it's something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
[A.DE.]
The world's world crisis is a reality that is not just one.
It affects the underwhelmed countries, the world's crisis is a reality that, on November 12, 2016.
It affects us directly and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far away in California.
A technological development world is powering people for consuming too much water.
They are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
Audience: Good afternoon.
In Spain, we also suffer from drought, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the houses of water in the future.
(Applause)
If we really want to make a change, if we really want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is to raise awareness, what we have to do is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems and what we also have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, about what the problems and the real needs are.
And with that, what are the solutions that will be really sustainable, what we have to do is support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption, to that small NGO?
They are trying to build poths in Guatemala to overcome these communities that unfortunately continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try to exercise a little pressure on governments.
Who are those who can really change?
These big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value the amazing luck we have.
To reach our homes.
Opening water shifts and always water goes out, or it's not like that.
Let's stop worrying this resource, it seems like no, but believe me, it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
So, we have to act, we have to raise awareness of both and act, and we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
This way we won't be able to change what we want to see in the world.
(Laughter) Luckily, there are many ways to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
(Audience talking) Hi!
This is our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
(Applause)
(Music) Wow, how nice it is for here!
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making a commitment with you. Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it is proved that emotion has a potential thousand times higher than the thought, the electromagnetic frequency that creates a thinking.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, you talk about the heart."
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
If you open your heart, you will surely receive 1000% of what I'm going to tell you if we get stuck in your mind.
We certainly received only one part, so that's my commitment. To start the conference, ask a quick question, about all the lines ahead to put ourselves in context. How is society today? Raise your hand and give me three or four answers, quickly?
It's not like that.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
A car accident, well, in my conferences I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you gave me the answers.
And then there's another question, you've just given, right?
Now someone in this room is happy to raise your hands those who are happy.
Well, that's it.
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
Why?
There were around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are?
Why are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they'd always told us more or less questions, they would have told us in that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is...
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we're accustomed to the media, information, where?
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids' diary and we tell them, "Be good news, bad and neutral news, day money," right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Well, this is what happens to us naturally when we ask a question or an impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with athletes on fashion, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby, or well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first national sport.
The complaint.
We complain about everything, the cold that 7th of July is 7 am, first we leave weather, then we leave the country, well, we leave my wife, and if we don't complain about something, something is wrong, when they ask me how you are perfectly well, it's happiness dish, what happened to you?
"Oh, don't complain about anything."
So we have turned ourselves into societies that jologists.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, this is a disaster, and this has to change, it has to change the country, the society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into recramologists, and the maximum, or pinologists and all achievements.
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
Some of you have heard someone who says: "I don't feel the ability to operate this."
And after we got everything, he produced it with my friends, he's a friend Fernando who came up with him and said: "I packed two sympathers in that place, do you know why you stay with no batteries because he got up to the soy?"
Did you understand that the donor is going down there, that time we leave everything, we opens the economy, politics, and...
And there are some worrying people, we have started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain, we complain.
We are immersive in opinion, what does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also took a...
It's a chargator, for doubts that it doesn't have much load, but with our energy you use it.
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
We need everything to change, the country to be fine, the weather should be not know what, because I was recently overwhelming and I came to give a conference and see with the rhythm, which was wonderful, and the ring says to me: "Yes, but tomorrow they're announced rain."
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society, above all, our generation.
That we have left our society in a moral crisis that wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents. We could imagine, facing, risky, but it's wrong, we're making our children believe.
But we serve for nothing, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
We don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how is this phrase represented there?
Do you see how architects are?
And what do you want, are we in Argentina?
We hear this and if it were worldwide, do you know what we can do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-compense teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important. So I formed that the ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived, that I lived complaining, which was hell.
That talent...
It was important, I had to have talent, experience, and I formed more and more in this, I saw that all of them add up, all add up.
So I looked for more knowledge, more skill, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude multiplies.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimistic guy, you are a heavimist guy, and if you have a merd attempt, that's a type of merd.
Sorry.
So, if I started to say, how or to get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed only my attitude and everything changed?
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I was going to do, who was looking for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's position all the time being justified, criticizing, robbing, and I began to prove...
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw is that the protagonist of this leadership is a square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And for me, and you see what here in this square meter, I live in the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why by handing a shirt that says "I respect".
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example, because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to live a different world, because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I went to the subway and I told him, "Tell me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was in the winter and lived in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full, but hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision, because hell I have it next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
When it begins to claim all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
If we'll always be waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the man in the theater.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
This is not all the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's just one.
With the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, these are the ways to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I am the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change the protagonist things, those people in change, are not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start producing energy of optimism, because do you know what with the people you put together, you were told?
And you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare.
If you're with a group of failures, I'm a failured, that makes you a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
And you start with your square meter, contagiating solidarity, optimism, and I started to emit that energy. Why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco was to buy a kilo of side a helium that doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "Pelices Pascuas" and she tells me: "These people were born and I, in the first time, made me happy to pass."
And I say to him, "Hey, hippie about 300 happy people, why?"
"No, she says, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What do you lawyer for?
Emite respect, respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, which is what you are emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy, and according to what you put, it's what you receive, this is like AME, if you're in AM and you go from a PP to the other side, you'll listen to Radio AME, and now if you change your frequency, there's another melody.
And what's more, at FM, you have the frequency you want to hear, you can choose, but if you're in ADM, even if you go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to it.
I mean, the world is, as we created it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, if I get out in the morning I start to say, "The first match is against me."
"Oh, I'm up, I don't get up."
Well, I wake up, you sing with humour, or with good humor.
With bad humour or not, with good humour, well-disposed bad predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence or media creates this difference, the path that you take is a blind as you get up, those victims or the protagonists.
You will show what you want to build for the generations that come or you will make the interests that today are governing us and taking us out of domesticated nostress.
People drive it for fear.
My father told me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Well.
We form, no, let's be safer each time.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this foundation of my borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we did, they were going to happen. We brought together veterans of war with Argentinians and Vitanicans, a role to the British sea and with "Gurcar."
And they gathered with Argentine veterans and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
And do you know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew, do you know what he said?
It works for lives, that a measuring unit is that.
If they taught me that they were the bad guys and now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 and half blind.
I invite you to see it, I'm going to tell you two life stories that I had the blessing of living with the Berkuy Foundation without Borders. It was in 2012 I went to the Baja de Gaza, a conflict between realities and Palestine realities that had been 70 years old.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
I understood that all the time I was worried about what I was missing. One morning I see a Palestine woman was the city of Belén, she came and hugged with other ladies and celebrations, no and celebrating.
They are celebrating.
Then the translator says to me: "The water tank was filled."
What does the stage mean before I do, that has drinking water at home to take the whole week?
If you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water.
And they celebrated it, right?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy, I ask him:
Do you know what the lamparadian genius is through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
So I explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladium.
And I tell her, "I work with you, what do you ask me?"
A kid looks at me all excited and says:
"Give me the hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment ...
I was connected all the time with what I lacked.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
And if I could give a bathroom, if I would have one?
It's where to sleep.
So they lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude.
I stop being in the world of carency and I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story, I want to propose an exercise all of you in this state that we are now.
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
If you close your eyes, imagine at this moment.
All the things we have to never give them.
Valor, we don't give him any importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to be able to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
Like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do.
With all the people in this room...
Now you feel, what have you been?
Being born or selected or chosen by all you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude because of the state of things that have done until now.
that express that gratitude.
Slowing standing applauding the strongest thing that can yell by doing what we receive, that we are in a society at a moment when I decide very well, very well above, very well above, for the love of our lives, for what we have, above all, these gratitudes that we have to express, for the things that you've received in your life, if you feel it right now, from this moment, and clap very strong.
The longest way to go?
It's in four stadiums when we got to get down.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we realize...
Everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
What do we just felt and this feeling?
When you're going to give a shower and each day of your life.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
The genius of the radin lamp?
He asks what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path we're going to travel, if we're going to hell or if we're going to paradise.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music, you know why? Because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin, in bones, in rhythms.
The Sun goes out on the moon, my life.
But music also lives in pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with the sound as if it were a player, provoked Pach, until we grow up and we bring music with us.
And it also creates bridges, creates alliances between institutions, families, schools, so that we can all go together and grow in community, music creates rituals to accompany everyday life.
So that we can welcome us, say goodbye through games and songs.
(Applause) Welcome to the talk and his group.
(Applause) (Music)
Believe me, it's not easy to face this in front of a sea of people.
Why?
Imagine then what bullying must be, bullying those physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, and that's why they're also known as school support.
(Laughter) One of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems. However, 5 or 10 years ago, I think a few or none of us had heard this word "bullying".
Although it also usually says that this is nothing new, that it's something that always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age that we have, we have an experience with this type of situations, or because we live it in our own meat, or because we contribute to exercise it against our own colleagues telling our poor colleagues from then in childhood, or because we simply press it, it was called "Take a point to someone to mock" now it is said "mullying."
Well, but I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new, you have similarities with what happens before, but it's not exactly the same. For several reasons, first, we didn't have a word to name it or name the phenomenon, or at least, it wasn't this bullying word.
So, it wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to promote laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was, but it was thought it was more or less normal.
It's capable of an unwanted consequence, an lateral effect, with the probe of school coexistence, but not that serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to the children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that at that same time, that is, not so long ago, other school drames were considered much more serious than those fights, without any importance that happened in the recreations and in the halls.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Both children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
(Laughter) Although now going round tends to do the opposite, which are the punishments applied by an authority, as a teacher, or a director, to the students who did something considered incorrect, something considered uncomfortable, it seems that they are increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
Teachers of school humiliation, which are these scenarios that the same students apply among themselves.
For the various reasons, but almost always for something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim: Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's about a big historical change, a big historical change, about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts, intonestations, bad grades...
What operates there is fault.
Culp for having done something wrong, something bad, guilt is an internal emotion, private, refer to a moral conflict, to a drama of each one itself, for having done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, that it shouldn't be because it's incorrect, but that everyone think that it's bad, even me.
I feel guilty because I did something bad, now in the case of bullying is not the fault what is at stake, but another kind of emotion, embarrassment.
It doesn't refer to a private drama of each of us, for having done something bad for others, other people's eyes, that judge me in an incorrect, unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty, it's the others that exercise my cruel looks.
(Laughter) Because it seems to me that the alien look, the look of others, which obviously was always important, lately has won a demeasurable weight, dismissed, perhaps, at the moment of judging who each of us is and how much it is.
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change, and of course, it's a very complex change, it's not from now, it's generating for decades, and it's finishing to consume now, it's crystallizing now, and I think it's one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that previous us, and made it 90, the conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes, that was believed that it defined each one in a much deeper and true way that appearances.
These appearances are not only considered vine, but also fake, so-called.
As something lower, something without importance compared to the entertainment of that truth or inner beauty. Well, I believe that all this is values and beliefs that still remain between us, but that we are abandoning them.
No, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in recent decades, the importance of the personal image of the physical appearance, gyms, esthetic treatments, all of that.
And this notion is lost that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see, it also matters a lot.
But that are not the guts, not that they are inside each one, but that they are not the guts, but something immaterial, like the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increasingly believe less and more in what others can see.
And according to these transformations, others judge us from what they say, and less from that notion that there's something inside, inside, eternal, eternal, mediodictoriana, an anticuated medium, that would be more true from the acts and appearances.
Together with this, I find a series of indices of transformations, and one of them would be the self-management, tactics or self-production techniques, that are everywhere, and that are even recently considered a bad taste.
But let's think of an example: conquest, an obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "me like" This also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and who deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, a infinity of symptoms of contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries.
By going through the shows and bullying, but thinking about this broader context, it doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious, so serious.
That is, fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives, because it seems that fault has lost a good part of its moral efficiency.
And this, of course, is very complicated because it requires a leadership, an administration of two vertical issues that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to do what we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and spread our image, but on the other hand, it's always the risk that this look generates, doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, mockery, ignorance too, that ignores us.
So, we have become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about complication, cyberbullying, when these mocking or disseminations spread on social networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc.
Protected by the walls of the school or the house, suddenly it exposes to millions of people, everybody knows it, so embarrassment becomes terrible, not much serious, and we don't have to take refugees.
(Laughter) Not within oneself, nor in intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping to an island of a certain way, that there are more and less or no more, at least no Wi-Fi, which is the subject, so it seems that this idea that hell is us.
It has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependency that we develop, regarding the button, I like, this magical click that we expect everyone to consider in front of any selfie or whatever we post with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) Well, if all this is happening in fact, this historical change with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do?
And well, the bad news is that the solution I don't have, but I think I have some clues before, it seems that both fault, as embarrassment, are social control mechanisms and the fact that fault is losing a good part of its future now and that embarrassment is magnificating, that's not good or animal in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind, it's a fact, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve it as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
The trend is what he wanted to tell, thank you. (Applause)
breast, breast, well.
(Applause)
(Applause) So if we talked to my children every day at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
Because we wouldn't forget these days.
And he let me tell us.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment, but in the good ones.
Today I'm thinking a lot about this, I dedicate myself to researching its education and I feel that the pandemic sent us to strength in a sort of educational and global experiment that is forcing us without believing, to explore what happens in a world, what hyperconnected in which we can't go to physical school.
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
And I'd like to share with you these ideas that I've been walking around these days and that hopefully, one of them serves us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, we all have the urgency to dare find new ways to teach.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and obliged by the emergency, those who dedicate ourselves to teaching, we have to redesign our classes at distance, and in this process we are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms, social media, called media, and especially to keep connecting with students, with families, to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available, but that we had never had the urgency in difficult periods of need to use.
They are now, but so important.
(Video ends) And the good news in the middle of all this I think is that once we try them, we use them, those strategies are already making samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings, we have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to have patience, we do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning, we're holding the taste, getting new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system, today teachers and teachers of all kind are teaching online what they know, from yoga classes.
Until fabrics workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging them to do it, as they don't know if well in these days, taught each other that they began to show a space, at least in part, the boys and girls told us always that the school I dreamed had to make bank tricks to the people of her age, and just as one and another.
To choose what to learn.
And when and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
In these days, many families began to realize that many times children, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own times, others start with the subjects that are more interested, others connect with their partners to do the task, or a change on the web, to finish to understand something that they don't get out, or to learn something new, that they wanted.
And this also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working on the side.
And he also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them, from very young, to organize their time, manage the tasks and all that requires to learn to learn.
And my last reflection...
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as it happens nowadays, we don't have physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, declarative way, but in the skin, in the body, when boys and girls can't go to school, it's stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees, that everyone can learn.
They have a calm place to study, and those who don't, this pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between home, it's not just the one with a computer and the one who doesn't, the one with the Internet, the one who doesn't.
The one here has to ask and not.
The one who has to be all the tasks of care in the house.
And the one that doesn't.
Well, school.
With all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
They are protected and focused.
To learn.
Well, as an educator really worries how all this will follow and I also ask myself what will be left of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is...
When the tide is worth it, and it's on the naked beach, I hope that even though, as my son said, this historical moment isn't for any good ones, it helps us make our own what it takes, what it breaks, between all that drags that tide, those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relate to the use of time and ways of learning and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
But today physical works are closed, but one of those is opening a door to keep building together, when all this happens, among all of them.
It's the education we dream.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music ends) (Applause) At night I dreamed that the Corentena lasted too long and suddenly ...
We got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control, driven by truck drivers from their house.
That doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home, the doctor in yours, X-rays, the tea and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up 7 toM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand the functioning of vulnerability.
That motorcycles could learn to cyber-attack.
that mythomans and chisms gathered in the spread of conspirantolid news through social media.
And that those who used to buy pulsions before, peanphiles, the naive shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for Rivery Soñé.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, they appreciated a button.
Marigón Alibre yes, or Margó la Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then we always earned most of a day for the other, without North Senors, nor theoretical deputies, deciding instead of people, I dreamed that the Church was also an online one.
The girls gave them the curas on YouTube, and of course it was forbidden to emigrate them by Youton Kirls.
I dreamed that an algorithm supported lawyers and judges.
And that from one day to another, all those who had ever been rights, had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert.
And that, in the end, we got used to buying in the neighborhood's negotiation and we had a line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar with the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they had before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that united who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them, because we realized they thought all day up in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
No, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or they did addicts to something else: I knew that TED talks had to be seen from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, they were dots like in the field, and that in the field to buy imported products.
They proliferated, suddenly, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very short communicator, the president told the people that it was possible to go out in the street.
That you could make normal life, leave previous sky, occupy your jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that an avestruz crossed the 9 of July.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked to the avestruz.
To make us a cell and the animal and without wanting.
We suffocated it and killed it.
And that a sintriculing truck shocks against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out of their house and the journalists showed up that they'd go back to the street to take selfies with the dead avestruz and to steal wine.
To transmit the live massacre and then over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Isn't it that when you see a picture?
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem nicer.
(Applause)
That fact has always caught my attention because if you think that photogeneration is there.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't move it, so a few years ago I started actively to draw.
Meaning the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So, I embraced that challenge to do with detachment, to indicate the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing and the idea we have to know.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible we have to look closely at the visible.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom: "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?"
(Laughter) Ponco told me.
And just as I know, I felt challenged and I suggested to test it.
(Laughter) If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds.
I would eat the last or unbelievable with a cream that was staying in the drawer. Imagine my illusion when he accepted, I put the cranomer and I went direct to Instagram, I wrote a lyrics by chance and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until the Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, singing the happy birthday, so I assumed it was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some benches of art and I said, "This girl likes art." Something that later I could confirm with some pictures she seemed painting.
(Laughter) That was going down, it was going down and I discovered that who is currently an object was his best friend, who is a trans girl, who grew up in school last year and who is currently studying graphic design.
And among all that, I could also see that it's a healthy person who attacks eluclelele and drinks it, so it's very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds, my mom was unthinkable, I couldn't believe that I could know a person like this, through social networks.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show, not because they're there, it means that I leave 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
(Laughter) I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To go from a general idea, that person will know details.
Today, thanks to social media, it can say that it completely transformed and it is the reverse and something immediate.
And, thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends, and then make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
(Laughter) My generation is tolerant, multicultural and it has a lot of social and environmental concern, this is much more powered in social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram, I didn't judge her for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it, or for her to choose to show me their reality, on the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helped me question what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like in which I spoke about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself what am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if it's like this, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and I was eating very deserved, invites with a cream.
So we wonder how these 30 seconds our meetings are transported in the day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social media went through screens and my day-to-day meetings is present.
(Laughter) My behavior in the real world, that's why it changed completely, when I met a person I don't know, I don't look for a label to embrace it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
(Applause) I ask everything without playing, and obviously I ask his user in social networks, thank you very much (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Music ends) (Applause)
Let's do it?
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think you are looking?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
For two eyes.
From different parts of the face...
You will have stopped somewhere.
Effectively, some artists like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci knew that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait.
Also, the nazal sacrifices, the mouth commissions, the borders of their ears, receiving the pores and details, were fundamental elements to form what we would call: the portrait's look.
It was as if, somehow, these people knew.
Which were the faces parts that the spectators searched?
And developing a portrait, showing evidence a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she is looking for the other, the one in the spectrum.
So we thought what would be like if we could see how a spectator came about.
In a team of positioning in a laboratory of neuroscience we put several portraits to many people and we registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image over time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face to extract information since the rest constitutes the brain?
If we put all the images or all the looks together in the image, we could see which relevant parts are when we put together the portrait and which ones not.
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that portrait we just spoke about and the view of the spectators.
We thought then how it would be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together, the look of others.
What we built was what I am showing you today and that I want to share with you.
This brief trial for the journey of an eye, is somehow a strict of some projects that took along with Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes, customs, languages.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
(Music ends) It's the search for childhood, questions, exploration. Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
At the exact moment in which we are born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However...
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago, when I started working on longevity issues, many people asked me, "What do you do so young?"
It's my future, he answered: "I want to live for many years and I'll go there, what they didn't say that moment."
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Meet to be old, no.
Fear to live in a society where the most important thing is to be or to be young.
I keep my knowledge and my experience losing value.
That my word...
It hasn't taken into account.
I stay at the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the elderly women who suffer the most.
Besides, stereotypes linked to age are still socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities, in labor searchs...
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
Often, we don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
We take some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
When the data of the male dive of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-beatable.
That is, they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
Or this shared belief that the elderly are sad or depressed?
When 80 percent says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people of my age or even more young.
Or this passive class label?
Casi passive Class, who seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
Are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives because they determine social behaviors and institutions.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
(Laughter) Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a person of 65 to get a credit or funding for their project?
Even when it is proved that the projects involving elderly people have more chances of success.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Not a call or an opportunity for financial financing that includes them.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country, geryatry matter does not exist.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field, that at 70 are invited to get rid of their age issues.
(Applause)
Who defines that chronological limit, all the 69 can teach them?
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them why, every time they treat older people, they use the same photo.
That of the older person in a park, giving them food to their dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images, words are missing.
older adults, third age.
Levely, elderly are the suits.
Germaine: Green!
Ancians?
I still don't find a word that identify or according to everyone.
The only one I suggest to avoid is a grandfather or a grandmother.
Except they're your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But if you are careful, you could say "my" because you're a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond.
older people have a name.
It's like everyone.
(Applause)
Stereotypes stimulate them.
Exclusion.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina there are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither accept ourselves.
If we collapse, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, create employment, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opened doors so that we rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
(Video ends) Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However, business proposals and education that exist are considered almost exclusively for children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very diverse group that no longer responds to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why, my proposal is to listen and learn from older people to really understand their new needs.
Its new possibilities, desires, and tastes.
A while ago, I interviewed an older person, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be activities with people of their age or with younger people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to assume our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
Yeah!
We are the ones who are going to do, thank you very much. (Applause)
