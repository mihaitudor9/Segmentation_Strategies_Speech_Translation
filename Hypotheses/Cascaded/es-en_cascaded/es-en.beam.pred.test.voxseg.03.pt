I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me with it.
(Laughter) It's very simple, do we need?
Or learn to feel, think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I was diving in the star of Lomboca, in Indonesia, 30 meters below the water, with that feeling of tirelessness, turtles, hummon fish, at that time, I had an intense feeling of being connected to nature, it was a very deep mystical spiritual experience.
Are you fragile?
And black and yellow people came out of a fish bank and it was put right in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were communicated telepatically.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was an intense spiritual feeling, and you're thinking, "This teacher is crazy, spoke with fish," it's the same thing my students think at university every time I tell them, they look at each other.
And they say: "Yes, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy, huh!
Why?
And for that I bring you a scientific test from the globe, which is an artist.
He works 24 hours for a week.
To draw that work of art that we're going to see, or on the contrary, the maritime stream would take it, that mandation that we see proves that nature has awareness and that I can't stretch.
And if I am able to talk to fish?
Is it true that indigenous peoples can speak with birds or plants, rocks, mountains and other natural phenomena? I think yes?
Last year Science magazine published a study, scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three quarters between pregnant and predators, that is, for every four smoke there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in an amazing way to this same mathematical pattern, reproduces our inner, in our organic physiology.
(Laughter) According to the law of clayber, an elephant that has a size thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat a thousand times more than the mouse, but three quarters.
And if you stop to think about it?
So I ask myself: Is it a mere coincidence on the planet we live in or really nature has an inherent consciousness?
So, after thousands and thousands of years of intersistemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great history of my doctoral research, that is, we should imitate and perfect all those sciences that integrate and unify the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of the human being, and here they bring a summary.
(Applause)
The first complex cells were originated, the biological variety has increased at a great speed and the miracle of life, between 3800 and 3500 million years, with the appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated, the corner chain.
Thanks to the fossil remains found until the year, Echac is known that autropitects have about 4 million years, the black homes of mammals, started the hegemonic period of mammals, today, homo sapiens is the only survival of the human species that cubs, hasn't got the rest of their rich God.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants about 10,000 years ago and especially since the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings have been adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has been revealed, as something unbearable.
It's a species between species.
In a parliament of 30 or maybe 100 million species, only one species, one more unitanean, is destroying the processes of covolution of the rest of the species, and that is to be crazy, and all of us are responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve at all costs, but the human being keeps trying to destroy everything around him.
Since the midst of the 20th century and for the first time in human history, human beings have technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them, although it seems we have forgotten of irosima and Nagasaki, we have already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than nuclear Bomb.
To give you an idea, they equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars, that can reach 65 million integrated degrees, and, if that were not the future generations, they are also threatened by the huge ecological footprint we left in Pachamama, our mother Earth.
In the midst of the 90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: From 1990 to 2020 we've been proved that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
Do I follow the world's forum of nature?
But we don't have four true planets, that's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think, if all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and life styles that are given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours, and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and carbon, has generated a huge global warming and this means, imagine that we close the doors and windows of which you are sitting.
PK: Yes, imagine it.
You know the barbarie, it's the stage we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones that best adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of co-operation.
While it is true that there is violence and pregnancy and excess of all forms in life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but co-operation, I give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, competing to achieve an ovum, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not to read that competition, but symbolic union, having a spermatozoid and an ovule between two different ages that create a new one, that defines life and cooperation.
football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but we don't realize that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players together with all the technical body behind them.
And constant processes of trial and error, paradoxically, our body is a pluricellular organism, where millions of cells cooperate to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of coevolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered linear catastrophs.
Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed communism that failed socialism, that failed as well, that is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and for their children, that is to be crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and their children.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, money has colonized life, biomimetics is a new science that imitates nature to solve human problems.
And it's something inside all of us, we all have that college, and I invite you to play a game, my goal, my imitation of life.
How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us, imagination, what did they think of making a plane?
What would happen to them with the peak of the martimbolator?
Well, the Japanese made the bullet train.
And with this bat.
We could make a trick, right?
And with this winning wedding.
We could learn to fly.
With termites, we could build bioclimatic buildings.
Well, with this circle alone.
A plant of solar panels, as we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bioispiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature will be there forever, and many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb up for one percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murdering it to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started for the industry, and that you will think of them, if we don't do everything that is at our reach, at least you tried it, you fought.
And you?
And what would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
What I have to say is that quarantine is not an opportunity, and the pandemic is not an autonomy, it's horrible things, and I learn it deolitically, we do it wrong, we learn it from the pain of the appearance, thinking about the idea in which I was meditating, from a book, and it's not because thinking that it's an opportunity to take advantage and that we're leaving out of something that is a great moment to learn, it's not a great moment for anything, it's horrible moments.
And what struck me was that for him, as a person writes, and then decides to spend the time, like now that we spend the time, and it's a lot of movies of the second source of his career, it's the newspapers that have already brought me to the USA to play a very important garden, called modern nature from the American cinema, or whatever.
Or cleaning and thinking: "Well, even if the only thing we do is was to wash dishes, not the only tasks we promise are those."
And also due to modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that makes the original, which produces the volume that the reproductive work is also correct, basically, cooking to the workers so that the next day they put the factories, by the care work, and that the reproductive work has economic value, because reproductive work is a difference, by reproductive work, we don't think of a concept that comes out of the most feminist, we don't think of a productive value, because we don't have an absolute value, because we don't have an absolute value, because we don't have an absolute value, because if we have an absolute value, we don't have an absolute value.
We think it's the opposite, even, it says care work, it's the most important, and now we're living without advertisers, without writers, without a lot of things, even moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps turning, the only thing that allows us today is to eat and without health and clean.
That's also a strange way of thinking about what we have to overlleve, but, that's why I thought that careful relationship with our bodies, let's think that hope it didn't exist, that hopefully it didn't exist, that there isn't something that already existed in the natural world, that are not methaneic, and that, in fact, when you invite me to do this step, which is not absolute, because you can't think like that, because you don't have a value in another way.
Thank you very much.
When people are going to be a diet, the first thing they think is what they are not going to eat: no bread, no more sweet, no more posters, an end of a half.
These foods don't fat, what wakes up is the unmed and disordened form in which we consume them, but today I want to name you three key aspects to have a good food: the first is consciousness.
Once a teacher told me, "The secondary awareness of brain activity," and with brain activity, the experts are missing on this subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if we take secondary awareness to our desires, we would never choose a food we wanted to eat, but on the contrary, the one we liked the most.
And after that, we are aware of what we are feeding ourselves, what we are eating and what amount.
A good fact is not going to the super hungry, because when we are hungry, we are not hungry, we are hungry, we are hunger, and the caloretical hunger, and the desire becomes unstoppable to that or to those food we want to eat.
The most tentative thing has always been forbidden, right?
The one who diets and gets restricted, fast food, is constantly thinking about pizzas.
B, dream, hug, an escape with double cheese.
So?
Returning to this topic: Are we really able to say pizza, nothing funny, I prefer a hole?
Impossible, huh?
Well, the second aspect is practice.
To eat, like every process in life, you learn.
And in this case, and in many cases, my include remains.
We must learn to eat in this station what this means, to eat the food that was costed at that time.
A: This allows us to guarantee a control and balance to our weight and to enhance our health.
Because foods that were expelled, their own, at the time.
They are the most natural food, that is, they are not addressed with calories, they are the richest food in nutrients, or it's normal to see fruit all year, unnecessary for our body, and they are not treated chemically to survive in time, or it's normal to see tomatoes, in winter and summer.
So this mechanism, led to practice, will guarantee a quality and variety consumption where we won't fall in monotony of eating always the same.
The last aspect that for me is not a small one, but it's one of the most important in moderation.
Those who don't break up, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they use them, I have a question: Does anyone use them to repeat the match plate with fruits?
To think, right?
So, what do I mean with this, that hunger gets accumulated?
That hunger isn't affordable if food is restricted if food is taken out, which is not consumed today will be consumed in the afternoon or at night and in double part, to make it more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
More and more size, more and more volumen and with more strength.
So, if we don't stop every three or four hours to take a break.
Why?
That snowball will disappear in a vorace manner at the first time we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to unleash with all the food around us.
to finish.
Together with this, I want to unleash the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the cheaper jokes, I'm going to lose and not.
The most expert body becomes a reserve, and when I mean reserve, I mean this, I mean this, to everything we want to eliminate from our body.
Food doesn't only make you fat, we go out in favor of that ignorance, food can hurt you or can cure you, depends on us, take awareness, what we are feeding us and what amount.
So, I return to the moderation.
Just as there is the phrase that you must know it, drink with moderation, there should be a coma with moderation.
That such food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closure, I propose you to eat rich, eat everything you like, eat variable, but always take care of the portion.
Not at all, there's a phrase from "Sayuna como rey," "Almourza como prince and dinner as a beggar." I think many of us know it: " health doesn't have excuses, I can't, there I don't have it, there it happened to me, or worse."
Sometimes I died of breastfeeding.
We have four opportunities every day to choose how to take care of ourselves and to eat healthy, thank you very much.
A while ago I was obsessed with telling stories of female scientists, I love it, the first one that happened obvious to me: Marie Curie, they didn't give them a Nobel Prize, they gave them two, so they deserved their pedestal, and they say it was a very cool way that you could go talk to her, and they know that they died since 2002 that I work at Ugeneas University to do it.
But I found out of them recently.
How I lost it, they didn't give me an idea to the anger that this made me find out of them very recently, a lot of anger, that's why I tell stories of female women, to honor those who were, but above all, to not lose ourselves at the age.
We've lost a lot of time at school learning ortography. Kids keep losing a lot of time at school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
(Laughter) And the question and the answer are new in our language, comes rooting from the century to the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas came into our ortography, a very clear and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and say, they should be eliminated.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, as we say, is and is not at the base of ortography as a cat, which sometimes are aspers as people, who write, but we don't pronounce, so we stay with gestures, feces, feces.
Three letters that in some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
However, I have the feeling that the teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important, even if all of us went to school, I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for their own experience, we all witnessed large amounts of that plastic, child, indicated, in the memorization of ortographical rules, crying, however, of exception.
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is quite simpler and less transcendental of what you usually believe, ortography is useful to uniform writing, so that we all write the same and so it is not easier to understand ourselves when we read, but in contrast with other aspects of the tongue whose complexity, they deserve time and effort.
(Video) What I propose is not to embrace ortography, it's not that everyone writes as they want.
Longue is a common tool for usage, and therefore I think it's fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be, above all, because if we simplify our orthography we're not leveling down, language is a common tool, or a lack of convention even at the time of them, but not quality.
But let the teachers go back because they're key characters in this story, but the truth is that when things like you are, that makes all the sense, you can get or stop achieving a job by a H, who put or stopped putting, you can become an object of public mock for once misplaced, so, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography, but we shouldn't forget that.
Throughout history of our language, we were always teachers or individuals linked to teaching the first letters, those who promoted ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography there was an obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, the biggest ortographic reform that had indeed place in the Spanish language, which was the one of Chile, the mediated ones.
In the 19th century.
Because then it's going to take the bet of those teachers and start moving forward in our orthography. I'm here, in the intimacy of us the 10,000, I'd like to put some modifications on the table that I think is reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate the HMUDA, where we write an H, but we don't say anything, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify to someone.
All the engines made by HEMUDA, Bélarga and B-Cort, we said, "Never did they distinguish in Spanish language," we chose one, it can be any, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one can argue, we want no one, we eliminate the other, "If, hijota" and that the jauta retains the sound "asperó."
Jalabe, giraffe, people, Argentinians.
And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it cannot be an absolute principle, in some cases, prediction differences should be attended, now I said before, it feels in some places that correspond to a sound in others to two and three letters, we descend to two.
We're all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit tragic, not so much, the real Spanish Academy, all language gyms also believe that ortography should be modified, and that sometimes the attachment to history, to traditions and customs, turn into an obstacle for today's use.
And that explains in fact that our language is much more than those we know, geographically close, it was modifying historically by us. For example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we were of quantity, we were from symbol to symbol, and, little by little, now, they start to remove oneself robbed in the dictionary of the Real to Academia, harp, harmony, they can write, or without H.
And we're all fine.
It also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to confront this discussion.
We always say that language changes spontaneously from below to top, which are users who incorporate new words, those who introduce grammar modifications and that the authority in some places a gym, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above to down. It was always the institutions that filmed the rules and proposed modifications.
Why do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment, until now, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use?
But at our time, the time of social media, this is undergoing a revolutionary change, it's never written as much as now, so many wrote so much at the view of so many, and in those social media for the first time, we're seeing at a huge non-violent ortographic scale, where even people with impecable or perishable orthography when they write social networks.
It is similar to how most users behave in social networks, that is, they relax ortographic correction and priorize speed and efficiency in communication right now.
There are chaotic, individuals, but I think we have to pay attention, because they are probably telling us that once they are assigned to writing, a new place, they are asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do wrong to reject them.
In detaching them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time. I don't think we have to observe them, order them and fit them inside a normal norm, with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, we didn't confuse the bank where we sat from the bank where we deposit the money, the traject we put of the things we bring, in the vast majority of situations, the context disciples any confusion, but there's a third objection, we'll stop distinguising among other words that today differentiate in just one letter.
And for me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one who says: "I don't want to change."
I get hurt like this, I got used to this way when I read a word written in simplified orthography: "The eyes hurt me."
FR: This objection, in part, is inside each of us.
What do I think we have to do, do as it's always done in these cases, changes go forward, children are taught new rules, those we don't want, let us write how we're used, it's in the prudence the consensus, the level of alism and tolerance, but we can't either agree and clean our orthography?
All those habits we use because we receive them even though they don't serve us, I'm convinced that if we do that in the modest field, but importantly in language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future.
Good afternoon before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes, I had coffee eyes with an accomplishment around light and say to me, "Go on, don't blame your eyes."
After his death, reality didn't make sense, he had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my formation as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when we are hungry, I felt the need to look at their ashes in the microscope.
Surprisingly, all the scientists I approached andaugurated monocratic images, the discovery I did transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space, an expansive space, without body.
It was absolute happy, it became peace.
This image.
Well, you see it.
And that's the image of the ashes of my father to the microscope.
And this other is someone's brother, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and all my sadness disappeared, I didn't feel disconnection of anything nor of anyone.
His death, more than a end, represented the beginning of which today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this taught me that our most pure material essence is acariciated by the cosmos.
And that when we look into the mirror there is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we think.
And that the matter doesn't grow or destroy itself.
They become more adivine action than a thermodynamics principle.
In Argentina, INBAP is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And space technology, its satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have the ability to innovate.
AC: We shouldn't create an INBAP for education.
Imagine a public agency that designs and contents and strategies to transform learning, which develops research on border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
(Laughter) A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of short-term political logics, the best specialists should come and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management: the first step.
It's thinking of the state as a possibility, not as the variable of all adds, just like that changes in education won't benefit the most advantages.
(Applause) Today, I'm not the scientist and I've been doing some experiments to try to understand the human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of those extraterrestrial, from big disoriented ones, even pandemics.
And here, now, at home, from the most extraordinary corners of the human condition, even the most ridiculous and the world's most, for example, the world's obsession to go out to buy hygiene mountains.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and ridiculous is a bit like the football player who runs desperately a ball that actually knows won't happen.
And failure is lived with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to the human being to try to find explanations to what happens to us.
Thinking that, in fact, nothing will happen to us, and this would have generated a great advantage of time to the rest of us, of not being for another principle of human psychology, the same here many of us are managing or driving while we talk about the phone or worse, while we send messages, and that had kidnapped their genome and made it public, and from many other places in the world, they lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for aren't biological or medical, but they are more moral or social, and, unfortunately, almost all these questions end up unbearable or stigmas, for example, in the bobonic fishing, they added to Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in a cemetery of rats, which were those that really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the cheapest ones, are useful above all to prevent people who are already ill with other people who abused it all over the world, it's a way to avoid stigma, and to take care of us all.
Maybe, what we've discovered beyond our traditions, our habits, our habits, because it's impossible to change them, but the truth is that what we really lack is motivation to do something, and the world turns around, and yet, in three days, now all children are educated at home.
Also, of course, they change our values, our judges, for their predisposition to limit individual liberties, just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the West people watched China with acusatory eyes to confin people at home.
Today what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And about this idea, how can our principles change and how can we adjust them, I would like to do a small mental experiment, a dilemma, a caricature so we can think about the future?
Imagine the following situation: we are at the beginning of the pandemic, a public council that includes the world's health organization, and we keep on this mental experiment, and we can use that information to know who is infected or who is at risk of being infected, and who, our temperature, our respiratory frequency, perhaps, where we are, where we move, who we find, who we find, and also data in a way and the world in the way we have done it.
Lastly, let's think that all conspirative reasons why we generally don't want to see our data, risk, or that it was a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: If you had the principle of the pandemic and could choose if you feel good or bad to do this?
And what would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's a voice to the inevitable attention there is, on one hand, the privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
To take care of us, to give up our data in a bit like vaccinating us, it's a concept we do from one of our many freedoms, as part of a social pact, perhaps and everything.
A while ago, with HIV, also a luck lets freedom, in this case with sexual freedom, when all this happens, what is the balance we want to get to feel at the same time free, compreservative, sex and care?
Will they fly less too is a sky?
Will we change the way we greet ourselves? Do we think it's good to be part of our tattoo as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked up at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want anybody to be the conservative sex of coronavir.
My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old on a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagona and Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with strings full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
It was an animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it "freeliers of sea," are partners of the sea wounds, and they were very common in the seas invaded Patagonio 15 million years ago, at that time, I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, I immediately tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about fossils I didn't know.
But I was interested in fossils, or fascination for these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past, and they took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet, around 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as what is nowadays, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other reptiles groups.
And I just told you 100 million years ago that it's a quantity that we paleontologists mention daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, you'll see 10,000 people in this stadium, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like this of 10,000 people, 10,000 for 10,000, those are 100 million, it's a number that doesn't enter in your head.
And this multiplied for a year of duration, think about what happened in all your last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to have in our heads.
But well, life has helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I have traveled some of them and I've studied fossils from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, south of China, South Africa, taking fantastic fossils, but it has also led me to a very special place, Patagonia.
Naturally we think about 70 million years, but for us we know many fossils of Patagonia, and for example we know that in the South hemisphere, dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called "Belisáurios," while for that time, in the North hemisphere, it's one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs.
But what happened before this stage that we know well, what we call the legal period, about 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were joined in a supercontinent called Pangea and we know very little about what happened at this time, in the law, in the South hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of the dinosaurs on our planet, for the first time they achieved gigantic size for the first time, they differentiated and achieved the niches of herbivores of carnivores in all the planet.
We've been dedicating this for the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of the Patagonia.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to make in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like these, walking a very hot afternoon.
And after walking all day long, I had just returned to the camp.
I was walking and I saw a few meters something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor, and I approached as I approached, it became clearly what it was.
It was the path where it hurt us.
I approached, stood next to me, shooled, I was really held.
I asked myself what it was, and in Bello I knew it was, after studying years of bones, anatomy, dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the trash part of a carnivorous dinosaur was.
But really, I couldn't believe it, I already knew it was one of those discoveries that happens very few times in life.
After warning the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
Protecting the rest to extract it, after several days we could cover it with bones lines, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started carrying it hard.
But the expedition was already over, we didn't talk with the team, nor the time needed to appear a huge excaution, and we had to go back to the museum until the next season the winter came, it was a long year of waiting, until we could organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the skull we had found, or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day of the expedition, clearly the animal had died in the dinosaurs' lengths, a complete skeleton preserved in a spectacular way in life position, in the rings of a lake and it was covered by endless clay caps, preserving in an intact way its complete skeleton.
And that's when the excavation really begins, to throw away layer, those sediments that were burning us where it was abroad, it's a very exciting moment, for the first time it's going back to the surface a animal that lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
The cinema had to have died, it had to be covered by seeding layers, that kept gathering up to gather meters and meters of sediment layers, and in that same process the bones turned into fossils by chemical reactions.
Then all that sacred rocket package had to rise to the surface for a fracture of the Earth's cortex and a warming of all this block, and the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, even start discovering the layers that contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking those dinosaurs, searching for those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of all that had to happen, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
And discovering the judges is a new species completely unknown until now.
It's a long work that takes hours under the sun, the patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry all these remaining protected by bones tables to the lab, in the lab to the museum, another very long stage is where technicians, with an infinite patience, are removing grain.
All rocks cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
Studying the anatomy of these remains, what we saw was that it was a relative, it was an ancestor of the abelizures, of those carnivores of the South Hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated being alive by a big ocean, in a big supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we really do them in the lab, we were able to discover the remains of a dinosaur that was contained in those role blocks.
The skeleton was quite complete and contained a very well preserved crater and with very strange accidents, dents in form of hand, and that's why this opened up to us and we call it "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very special, in addition, because of something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replica of the crash of this dinosaur, is a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or complete skeleton, would not take more than 50 centimeters from the end of the head to the end of the queue.
And this dinosaur minis didn't look like at all the forms we contracted or knew about the North Hemisphere, studying the rests, we could see that their closest relatives had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same ancient ancient times, the Atlantic Ocean was still not formed today to these two continents, and this was not so surprising.
We started to find other cases that adjusted to this pattern.
This led us to study together with colleagues who work in other animals who lived at this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environment at this time.
Returning the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of fire where all continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic, that was possibly present in the existence of a certain fact in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was in the south of this huge equatorial desert, it was a great fact what had isolated this fauna, making it evolve independently and completely separated from the fauna of the North Hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these vaccines, it wasn't a desert filled with water.
And when we really think about dinosaurs ...
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we've really told us fantastic, fascinating organisms, have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life, have diversified and achieved terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It makes us understand chapters like this is the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that were formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were formed.
The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written over 4.5 billion years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages still by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, its poems, the problems we're seeing nowadays, it's fundamental to know its history.
Because knowing the past is key to understand the present.
It's also key to project a future.
Like many of us, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers.
Today I want to share with you six ideas anticipating what would later do so many books and you would see so many movies, I dreamed of healing and not having Harry Potter magic wand, but something that kids' vocation remained in me to develop one of the most important powers in this situation, to play living.
Obviously there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I believe are less well-known.
The ones I'm going to tell you are my own ideas, I learned from others, and this is perhaps the main thing of all ideas, something like the zero idea I'm going to tell you about, that we are capable of learning and practicing.
So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: Imagine you enter a gym, look at those on the floor, parents of these brickets, fixed bikes, go to the bar, have a coffee with milk in three months of some meth and pig.
It doesn't work like that, our body doesn't recognize better.
Well, compensation happens the same, it doesn't count to think, because it counts to think.
We have to practice thinking, developing in ourselves the habit of thinking, in intelligence is not something you have or you don't have, it's something you use or you don't use.
It's the second.
It says the saying that only a tornil is not useful for us, but where these mental models are found, if we have many interesting models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology, as if we were trying to get a torn with a hill, with more tools, it allows us to do more things, solve more problems.
To think better we have to broaden the brand of tools of our head, but all the problems will seem worried to us.
It's the third one.
Recently, he was at the club and at the table on the side a man told his friends, after his son and his classmates, who had told him about his son's soccer teacher for a mistake that the teacher had made.
The man was right in everything he said to his friends, because he had told the teacher.
But he didn't realize that...
When he said this, he was generating a much bigger evil in his child.
I was leaving him like a bone in front of his friends and he was detegitiming the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that being focused on winning on a scale, we don't have success on that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another more important scale.
When we act, let's think about what scale this impacts what we're going to do and what is the most important scale to give money and lose freedom, or win freedom and lose love in which we have to think how to act.
The fourth?
And the beginning taught us that the essentials invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
For example, now in the pandemic, many acts of China arrived, those pressions generated emotion, fear, and emotions make us act, images of Italy, a country that we felt more relatives and similar to China, generated emotions and make us act, that we are all now preserved preventively what is moving.
This time, we were lucky that fear gave us time, because someone like us happened before.
But many times it's important to act when we don't see and feel.
And the practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us the modern civilization of prehistoric.
You are hungry, houses, you have an immediate reward, you eat what you married, but cultivating is very different, now effort is done for something that you will be able to fire within six months or a year.
This is the piling of almost everything we have, preventing us from creating applause, because it is avoiding something no one is delicious, but saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before we feel, that is, develop our ability to anticipate, is one of the main skills of thinking well.
Let's think for a minute, what do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we don't see?
The fifth: we all evaluate things according to our expectations; if something bad lasts three months, if we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we programmed to run 10 km, for example, at 9 km, we are exhausted, if we programmed to run 20 to 9 we are inseparable.
We do a point of resilience, but the key of resilience is to manage the expectations well, the sixth and last.
Some time it happened to you that you met an acquaintance where you are walking through a village in the middle of NASA, a high schoolmate who would not be 15 years ago, you can't believe in chance how unlikely it is to find it in that place.
It's true, finding that colleague in that place is something totally unlikely, but, as we know so many people, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life it's the same, there are so many unbelievable things that are very likely that something very unbelievable happens to us, the problem is that our mind makes us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the forecast which little from the future, we don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more normal times, we have to learn to coexist with uncertainty.
And maybe the intelligent way of coexisting with an uncertainty, and if someone ever asks you, not to think only the most likely and find ways to take care of us, when possible, with serious things, even if they are very likely, even if they are very likely.
That because once you were answered you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world with a high schoolmate who hadn't seen 15 years ago.
In other words, at the beginning that I thought about zero of this talk, most importantly is to develop our ability to learn and people with whom to grow these ideas, and learning has to do with being in the section, with which to grow these ideas, be able to empower us from people who enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others. An interview Borges 40 years ago, the interview asked me a question, and when Borges answered.
He looked at him, apologized, Borges kept quiet, and said, "That same question four years ago, did I not have time to think about this issue for these four years?"
Let's take advantage of this limited moment that is to live to be accepted of the new ideas that are emerging and always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
Women are irraational beings, always given to emotional disorder, that's why they need a man's guard, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives, will be contained by a good husband that you'll have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for education of girls and young women about marriage.
It was circulating all over the planet, in different translations, in the 1930s.
But the idea in itself has 5 millennia of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all moments.
In 1915, no country in the world, women could vote, in 2015, so, 60 years later, 65 countries are governed by women, in 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won two times the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But France's science academy said that I didn't have enough merit to be an academic, and the first woman in France entered science academy was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here were already finished elementary school.
Harvard University has a very prestigious business school that just in 1965, 50 years ago, is celebrating that, let a woman do the master's degree.
The Yale University admired women, just in 1972, the University of Princeton, just in 1974, and we could continue and continue.
This was this idea that women only use to create children and help their husband, who is an irraational being, who is cisteric.
It was true, in fact, a century ago, the same women believed in it, there were 1800 million people in the world at that time, and almost all taking 5,000, perhaps, believed that this idea was a truth in fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, it's more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the amazing mass, transformation, the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived through, if this is true, the facts don't exist, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our world's idea, 2500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem, now in neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not anybody, not the main world.
There's a huge discussion about if the world out there, ever we can understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that only social interpretations exist, are the basis of ideas, we have no human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative framework.
What is an interpretive frame, which day is September 24?
Does any of you doubt this?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we know it's on September 24th, because everything we're here agrees with the Greek calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in Ebreo, Jewish, or any of the calendar 500 or more that exists, every thing we say, every goal we think, every goal, every goal, live without schedule.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world, my dog, yap, hacker, and who, at this moment, is alone at home, doing some illness, don't look at the clock, that would be maybe, and a little more stimulation, but probably the world in which we would live wouldn't make any sense.
Every idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, he looked at a pity fall, was to write the law of gravity, what a genius, but it's not how ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin had lived in the 14th century and being the same genius he was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, the same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, as we have seen, the birds, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea, but if it was born in the 19th century, with the same happens with what we are thinking now.
Nevertheless, in less than 100 years, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university professors are women. They look at all the creative energy lost by humanity to think how women were not for anything else than to clean pneakers.
(Video) How much was humanity lost, how many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
In other words, wrong ideas are monstrous, there's an idea we can make.
You may say, but like in the Greeks and the Romans, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women or any other, transgenere that occurred to you today, have always existed in every culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animal species outside the human, but they had never thought that sexuality of an an anomal person, as it was called at that time, determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity was created.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the A generation.
Moral Víctoriana, who was one of the biggest forms of social control over a century and become stronger that exists, because the same thing that turns into the empecated sex of the Catholic Church, when it provises us of something we want to do is not more turbine.
(Laughter) You'll do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to blame you, it's not true, it's a big social control, huh?
(Applause) Don't tell the woman of your fellow man or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
That's going to blame you, it's going to blame you, and on the one hand they know we can't leave, it's as if they deprive us to eat, we can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censors, a garbage was created where everything wrong in the society from the sexual point of view was placed there, homosexuals during a century were terribly persecuted throughout the world, they didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves.
It also changed the current ideal situations, but in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be fusiled, but in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal, this was possible, because of the paradigm change, it allowed the struggle of gay, Jews, blacks, etc., all oppressed, assumed their identity, 20 years ago, they have to respect, and then, they are also human beings, who have a full right, who have a full right, who have a full right.
And gays, women and Jews, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictory people, that I might not want to meet a guy, I know, but I have to accept that, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just Jewish, identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
50 years ago.
Look at that old sun, I was a homosexual kid, I didn't know what it was to make a homosexual boy, and I didn't even say to me, "My schoolmate told me, "I'm going to hurt you suddenly."
"Sure, don't look at me."
I didn't even know what it was to be a cake, a dumb, a homosexual, or anything, and at the same time I knew that it was rejection, that was something I had in me, that I didn't know that my father, who loved me, looked at me.
And it made me feel that I've done that bad for it to come out like that, what was that?
I had to learn that it was to be like that, I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
And accepting the identity that is, had a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, the Jews here, the women here, if there are black too, they've learned the same thing that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, to do everything better than the others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I was in a terrible prison that was close by 24 hours.
And I stopped being a person.
And I am a person, like any other person in the world, I am against dictatorship, I am complete, I am complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings, and it took me 50 years to learn that I am also a contradictory complex that I don't have to be gay 24 hours.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
(Applause) interpretations.
(Applause) There are no contradictions and it's going to say, because that's it, we're contradictory, there are no facts, there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to take the assume to stay there to defend myself, and now I want to leave prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful.
Did you think what prison are you in?
After that, or they told me, "The constant movement takes us extraordinary situations, that there is a list of things we need to survive, that of Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to explore, but exploring is something difficult, scary, every moment, person and place are completely different, where a storm stays and everything you know disappears."
When everything I did, each of these ideas looks like a bomb that seeks to exterminate, but once you say it, once you can get your words, you take a avalanche of ideas that live towards you at all speed, of going back, falling, shooting, or running, your voice, my movements, that take moments, like a chain, moments when you don't stop laughing.
It will be the first to stand up, the first to give yourself a little pile to save that sea of possibilities, and at the same time the first one is in that brand, that voice, a microphone, a paraguas, a notebook, a dance class, and a better friend, that voice that so much you know, but will allow you to review, the way is satelist to get out of you, that person is a better friend, if I can't survive.
What we grew up in girls cities, I'm sure that once we choose, there's no opportunity to get out, there's nothing to do, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
(Laughter) They come to remind us that... laying and with a lady, remember her experience, but the goal. And then a person appears on stage already in years, and every married time was better.
Is this really the case?
When I think about this, I inevitably remember my friends of the whole life, or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
I can tell you about my friends, that I love them a lot, that they are like my brothers, that as they didn't count with the necessary resources to stay, as to be able to study what they liked, they stayed here in the city, and, surprise, until today, they can't get a job that allows them to fulfill their dreams.
As for me, as I am the port in this photo, the mark of the absence of opportunities also became present, my folks who are workers, made an effort on human beings that I could study what I liked, because I knew that I didn't know that if I stayed here in the city, I could study someone else's life, but probably the future as a person would be short of opportunities.
Have any of you ever wondered why these things happen?
We live in the middle of the 21st century that we are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, in which successes and progress are at a speed that surprise us all and collapse the borders and the barriers that exist between people.
And in this context?
And the cities to make more and more important such stories, we are going to be sincere, they are our home and we create them and recreate them every step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2058% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound, it should be nearly feels of every 10 people around the world.
Seven of dead bodies.
If more and more people choose to live in cities it means there are places where we have more chances to progress.
What is it that explains why, while the weapons of cities seem to stay in time, other progresses, are vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them?
Here I'm going to tell you a key word that they want them to keep the cow when they come out there for that door to return to their homes, this strategies them.
If we want globalization to help cities to treat more opportunities to people, we need to go out strategically to the world.
And, apart from my concern, as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely by this, by connecting the cities and trying to decrease the impact the world can have about our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now look how this is so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life, and avoid migration through concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population, to other places searching for a better future.
Secondly, as to say it's given a kind of investment relationship of my friends, it's about what it is, we add a fifth friend, the group would be, but, again, inevitably, I remember them what we were in it, we are going to improve ourselves.
Great!
Franco, for example, who is the one who's fine about her in this picture.
It was a national champion of geography alone in 2002.
(Laughter) But today, even though you want to do it, they had geography teachers, it doesn't have time because it has to be on Monday students working, simply to be able to live.
(Laughter) After Juancho, it's the one on my left, I like going to happen. How much did I want to study something related to the defense field to get into one of the security forces of the enfortaises, but since I didn't count on this possibility here, then, by changing this rule without being able to find what is really something about passion?
He goes to university to study programming, and he cannot develop his potentials and keep learning what he likes, because he doesn't count the whole day working in his place that built from nothing himself, every day working in his place, who built from nowhere, goes to university to study programming, for lack of budget to university.
The guy studies programming and doesn't even have the necessary programs on the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you is that we, as young people, have nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing, you know?
(Laughter) Recently I had the immense fortune of being chosen among a group of 8 cuberts worldwide team to participate in a weekend in the city of India. I left Argentina representation. I was the only Argentinian who sees, fell into my head.
But if there are two things I'd like to share with you, there are not millions, but not less important for you, neither the children, nor anyone, who have a state present to come out to the world and bring opportunities to develop themselves.
Once again we want better cities, we go out strategically to the world.
For the first time, I met Rosario to go to study, I remember, it was less unexpected, with a lot of fear.
(Laughter) This can never be said in public because it's very difficult, but all those around me know for all that I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city playing, until today I feel it like this, almost six years went by, it's like leaving a piece of your heart.
For this to happen to you, not to your friends, nor to anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our youth so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
After all, what's most beautiful to be allies to the city that had made you?
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine how brilliant it would have been Franco if it had been able to completely dedicate geography.
If I had the necessary programs to keep on understanding what they like.
That's it?
This is how opportunities are shown.
Of course, all that I desperate telling you doesn't seem to be enough argument and they want another example.
Look!
(Laughter) Very good.
This is the tattoo that tells me, when finally I was able to overcome the unique depression in which I fell for having to go to university.
After two intentions of suicide.
In numeral, psychological sequences that took me a long time to overcome.
If we want these things to stop going, we have to go out strategically to the world.
But, please, we don't eat a final point in our cities, thank you very much.
I'm a surgeon.
Well, since always the surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in the last 10 years.
(Laughter) My research, in my case in the sofa, was based on looking for the reasons to operate less and less patients.
And that can be done in several ways, we do that, for example, by looking for genes to detect early diseases such as cancer, and so we don't have to operate them.
We can help the tissues to repair themselves by themselves, using their own ability to regenerate. We do this with biological platforms, which are like maps we take to the tissue so that they use their own ability to restore themselves after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with a endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before they had to operate and take them out.
(Video ends) robotics is giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks.
What seemed like science fiction previously, today is almost daily, it's amazing.
Undoing my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfaction, me and a lot of patients that prevented having to become a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work.
I want to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Why?
I'm not a Japanese society doctor and I believe that certain behaviors and social and individual answers can help us when facing a crisis like this.
It's worth making a first question, having almost 130 million inhabitants, being so close to China, having the third age population in a very reduced space, the major in the world.
Sing in the second country with more smokers per number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
And the identified one, but a linear progress up until now.
Many people, in little place, and a fourth of these people, basically Japan presents us a cook that would enable us to demographic farms, so Japan presents us a cocktail that would enable a very contagious virus in this spreading disease with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society that went through wars, tifons, educated in a way, that answers organically and united to any event that compromises it: Japan, tsunami.
Audience: Yes.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 earthquakes per day.
Generation after generation has had to overlleve natural disasters contained by men.
We can think this with something that really likes Argentinians, soccer teams, for example.
What team of soccer will have better performance in a critical moment?
The team that train every day has infrastructure in which everyone knows what to do.
Or the team who never trained, who has no infrastructure, who has to go out to improvise.
And the directives of social distancing and hygiene and individual behavior can be replaced by their own home.
It's not necessary to say not to embrace hundreds of years because they don't do it, the Japanese population has not established, it's greeted with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most of the workers in public spaces use singers.
In fact, years ago, studies show that more than 50% of Japanese don't have to invite you to get your shoes when you enter home, because it's already customary, not to protect yourself, you don't have to indicate you don't want to stamp or possess any other person, that more than 50% of Japanese.
Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture, the good of all is more important than the good of a part.
(Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience two Western teachers did, you will surely know the sillas' game.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to take a chair, this experience was made in Japan, put music, chairs in a circle, less than the number of participants, and they were getting out of one, in each round, they were all sedating the place to a classmate.
Because it's embarrassed to win when someone else suffers.
The Japanese word loves this way of being, it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we do when we take care of others.
That's the same.
In the example there are children, but we can see how a collective society works, they help themselves, because each immetialism contributes to the good of everyone.
