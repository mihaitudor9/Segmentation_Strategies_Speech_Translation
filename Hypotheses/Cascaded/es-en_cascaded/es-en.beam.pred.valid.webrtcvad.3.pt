(Applause)
(Applause) (Music) ♪ Invisible, the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
At that time, I was a geologist.
It's pretty surprising to the same citizen.
It's a science environment.
It's there in the railing moment of stones, distant.
I saw orchestra music.
In general, death.
The one that avoids the sacred match.
We had a vision.
Do he do it?
Have you seen the sky and the instrument we make?
Protagonist.
It's our popular music.
For this, we change the force.
I'm talking about playing it.
So it's coming to an end.
I can't dance.
Milion pre-privile and live in Neuquén.
One of us lives in Buenos Aires.
I wanted to end.
They had to learn to work in reality.
It's called by video, each one records their part.
That's how the other can play on it.
And that's how we are talking about the repertoire.
Let's go with this kitchen.
Right?
(Music) ♪ Invisible, the air in the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
♪ Invisible can travel with the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Of course not even a pandemic is what suffers me.
That's what really works.
So I need it.
And the relatives of those who didn't recover.
What this time?
I take it with my hand.
They wake up to see a stance.
But there's another new thing in this pandemic.
Something like those who...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the content of social media.
And fighting with that information.
We had already seen it.
And not worrying about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there was already on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
But its consumption, its global penetration.
And at my time, besides.
The pandemic, COVI-19 is the first pandemic that lives with infodevia.
What is that, what information am I doing?
The WHO is the World Health Organization.
It defended it as a practice of spreading fake news and bad news about the pandemic.
And he called it like Aterda.
Because it generates panic and anxiety in people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
We know it.
But when it comes to health issues, it is much more dangerous.
Because what can affect.
What can put in danger is our life directly.
(Sigh) I haven't taught an idea.
Of the amount of waste.
To circulate these days on Facebook, on Instagram.
And you, on Twitter, and of course on WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's an idea, because they bet without a virus.
Every day, they suffer the viralization of content without verifying.
Four weeks ago with my team.
We work.
without rest.
Checking.
I have fake news.
A winner.
It's half-time.
that circulate over this new disease.
They know what, we know.
And we are aware that alone they can't stop this avalanche of that information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they are the "flustrac".
(Laughter) That's why I think it's useful that I tell you what we discovered, what we find.
All the contents.
In COVID-19.
Can you?
Let's encourage.
Or classify yourself in four categories.
Do I think they were telling each other?
You'll be more prepared.
And they are more prepared, maybe they can help to stop this avalanche of information on us.
The four categories are simple: The first one has to do?
With contents linked to the origin of the disease.
Some conspirative signs that say...
That an act of pioneering of two Chinese scientists stole them in Canada until an English lab created this virus in 2014.
Nothing of this forever.
If you see content linked to a theory that human beings created this virus?
They don't take it seriously, they download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus contagiates and expanded.
A wrong reading of a scientific study, of a Pepper, that caused the virus to live a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media publish that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window.
That's not the case.
There are no blood evidence.
The third category is related.
with fake news.
It's the most dangerous, it has to provide treatments and jury.
more attentive.
Those who have to force us to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we killed the virus and making rooms with hot water and salt or making vapor the virus to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that the vaccine is already going to heal us.
There's no Cuban land.
That he managed to create it, and there is no Argentinian that has already discovered.
I was with a savior.
Science works all machines.
To find adequate treatment and medicines.
But now it doesn't have an answer.
Totally satisfactory.
Now, the fourth category of misinformation is related to false measures.
To reach out of different measures to the limits of authorities.
Without the farther in Argentina, the day it was disappointed.
The preventive and obligatory social warming, like 15 days ago, or a little more.
(Sigh) There was a failure of credit that said that the Whentena started 3 pm. that day.
And it obviously generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others you encountered with, who say you'll fall on the Internet.
Not only in Argentina but in the whole world.
And so?
It makes us fear.
That we are not only going to be so much.
Encerrated at our homes.
but in communications.
Deinformation is in general.
Try to generate panic.
And it scares us.
That's why it's important that if you receive one of these contents that enters one of these four pieces and doesn't come from an official source, such as the World Health Organization or the Defies World Health Ministry.
Before I finish.
I want to tell you something else we learned.
Those who dedicate us.
To bite, cheat, cheat.
(Sigh) It's that...
We're not good.
No doubt.
We're not comfortable.
When we lack certainty.
Audience: Yes.
And then we push ourselves to look for that certainty.
Without all the care that we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, isn't checking?
Don't share it.
Let's replace it.
I begin with doubts.
It's so common.
(Laughter)
I don't compare.
For doubts.
That is taking care of our echo.
If you receive a content.
Are you someone?
And I didn't know what fake.
Please raise your sheets.
How did he turn around?
Confirmation.
And with affection.
And if you did share a content.
And then you realize.
What fake?
Putting boxes.
They cut them off?
And correct.
That's not so many.
but still alive.
The pandemic is dynamic, infectedologists, sanitarists, workers all the time.
There are changes every day.
Science works intensely to get the cure.
But that's it!
And it needs time.
Hundreds.
There are evidence and information vaccines.
Do we have to be capable?
Maybe like never before.
To tolerate that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties that we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
That we fill those brickets with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
Let's be.
Much worse.
That if we tolerate them.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
23 years ago.
So I dedicate myself to accompanying people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
I would like to share with you today.
I learned that...
Working is a means of pain.
Of other people.
It doesn't make you a bitter, nor sad.
That's the opposite.
It teaches us to appreciate every instant of your existence.
And be thankful for all you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe?
And in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If you can't see a miracle.
In an act of reconciliation.
Of sorry?
of love.
Or of transformation.
I learned that humor is a very powerful tool.
that allows you to do a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
insecurity.
And fear.
What do they generate?
The close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty.
Being more humble.
And not feeling frustrated or failed.
And when despite having done everything possible?
The result is not what we expected.
I learned that when we're going through difficult times.
It's good to see.
That there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more atterces than ours.
And that allows you to put it on.
Your own problem as perspective.
And finally?
I learned and I continue to learn.
That it's not just about healing.
Especially?
Is it about relating?
And to accompany.
Cultivate love and compassion.
They help confront suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
Multivate.
Love and compassion.
You can lie down.
A path of transcendence so that others can travel.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
Is it little?
I was 40 years old.
After writing several soap operas.
I wanted to write on topics more personal, more personal.
I took my pen and after several pages.
I realized that it would be inevitable.
Talking.
The thousand female conditions, the thousand conditions of women.
Why when a man is introduced?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good afternoon, I am Mr. Durant, I am a writer.
For a woman like me?
Do I have to decide good night?
Is it a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why do we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I dedicated a lot to start my research.
about women's condition.
It was a topic already written in many articles.
Feminity is missing.
Feminity disappears.
The topic becomes fastidious, especially for women.
But?
In the end, what is feminity?
Can we remember?
Limately, half of humanity are men.
And the other half are women.
Half of humanity.
Is manliness?
And the other half.
Is feminity?
So, why?
Does it ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
They would have told me.
I was going to write a book.
about women's condition.
I would have been surprised.
If it gets angry?
40.
I am really enjoying it.
Is it a topic?
It's so evident.
But at the same time, it was so ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations.
Different.
A man.
We just don't go by, it's on the street.
To see that humanity is divided into two groups.
What do you walk differently?
That they dress differently.
And who speak differently.
I liked research.
By distancing all beliefs about feminity.
The myths that exist.
Above all women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If I was not going to look for the causes.
I studied biological issues.
Physical?
And ecological?
Technology.
No man had ever happened to him.
Analize the peculiar condition of men in society.
The singularity of man.
Isn't that the shadow is everything in most languages, man is so much the positive side?
Like the neutral polo.
Men are humanity.
Men are the whole, the main one, the essential.
Women?
Is it the other?
It's the other.
Women.
The second sex.
Second sex.
Women?
It's not essential.
It wasn't defined by itself.
They define man reciprocity.
That it's all.
So I kept doing my research.
I realized that in the history of civilization...
Many times you create excluded groups.
Excluded as ...
The blacks?
Excrites like Proletaries, or Jews.
But among them there is a community.
Oh, the dozens!
Us?
Is it identical?
However, women.
What do they identify easily among them?
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a white name?
Why with a black woman?
A funny woman.
Will they identify themselves more easily with a burgh name?
And what about a project?
Women are not a community.
Women?
They don't say us.
Because they live disperse.
Inside us.
It's the group of men.
Why?
Aren?
It's quite satisfying.
Creating and feeling the king of creation.
Until the vifeminists.
They searched.
Teories in religion, teology, biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions.
Many men usually ask me.
Do you think that because it's a woman?
Of course?
As if I had ovaries and a uterus and rule and hormones would take me away.
Any objectivity.
As if they were, when they wrote their...
Teorías.
They didn't have their hormones and their terone texts showing them to think.
What I want.
It's awareness about these differences and understanding them.
Sharing what I understood.
Sharing what I understood about why women are ...
I behave differently to man.
And within all that I told you that I was studying biology to physiology, etc.
I realized something.
that women's behavior isn't dicted by their nature.
but for culture.
Is nature like that?
Society doesn't dictate, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
A woman is not born.
It gets to be done.
I was quite privileged.
When I approached my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time I was recognized.
As a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best of the worlds.
A complete individual.
Integro.
It's integral.
Many women remain feminely because men explain to him.
It's very natural for her.
Don't you think about it?
Go back to Sclava de Suez Possau.
To have children.
Give yourself to create them.
Men explains that everything is very natural to him.
Why?
His feminity resembles to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition.
For that, there's a lot.
What I do intend.
Do you recognize it?
To recognize these differences.
And how to synthesize?
that you can make decisions.
With my willpower.
What I want to share.
It's that every woman.
And every man.
You can, and you must decide.
About what she wants, for her sexuality.
Over what he dreams of doing his family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do at work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to conscientize.
That this effort.
It has to be done together.
Between men.
"Women."
What I want is to conscientize.
And when is the second sex?
These questions would have answered.
And it's living them.
So?
We will live in a society.
Complete.
The powerful one is.
That's it.
Men.
"Women."
Totally unpleasant.
And free.
Thank you!
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
To be honest, I guess you've studied for today, you surely know the entire role, which is a hell in search of freedom, or a hell that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go.
Like golden wings about mountains and colines.
And in the end it says.
And this spiral, these thoughts, so they can give it.
To suffering, value.
It's something he wrote: "You go, take up your searches."
More than 100 years and us.
We can take it as our own.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now repeat now, you've probably been breathing at home, but now...
Not that you know them, right?
Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, go with the court?
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) "Thank you, love, love, love, love, love.
(Applause)
(Applause)
A couple of years ago.
A group of my friends went out to marry for the abortion legalization.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me no.
In any way, I was very young to be there alone, and I was afraid of what could happen.
And then I said to him, "Okay."
And if you don't want to go with them?
I accompanied my voice.
And my mom.
Which didn't steal a parade from the time of Foncin.
He came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we got there.
He looked around her.
And he told me with a smile and a huge surprise.
Wow!
What full of kids?
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the same thing is understood, right?
What for my mom was so surprising and unexpected is something that is very natural to me today.
Talking about politics?
That is to say, what I think, to get out of what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think a little has to do with growing up with a almost strict diet of the book and movies on teenagers who changed the world.
Harry Potter leaves, the games of hunger, divergent, northern chronics.
What are the stories of my generation?
In all of them?
There are villains that oppress.
They discriminate against others, they say they are more.
And in all of them?
There are teenagers.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
I'm not surprised at all, then.
The attitude I see a lot of teenagers regarding politics.
Sometimes it seems they don't let any other option.
Because they educated us thinking that when we are living in a distopy.
Because it's a futuristic, dark and indeseable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put our head in a distopy.
terrifying like the one of climate change.
Where we are the youths.
What are we going to pay for the bill?
Sometimes I look around me and I feel we're living in one of those books.
But where there's one of these utopians also have to be those protagonists that reveal, right?
Anywhere where you do a death bag.
There must be a Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
(Applause)
For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all aspects of our lives.
In the culture we consume.
In the stories we tell.
In the versions we choose to believe, in what we think is right or wrong.
Even the bonds.
For me, they have a political dimension.
It happens to me -
Sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobes comments.
Or by discussing political things.
And as long as many people prefer to avoid these issues.
To not generate fights, their uncomfortable situations.
Me!
I have to do certain things that it's worth fighting for.
And to discuss with someone in their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm from the mouth and the voice of River that at the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't seem, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why a relative of mine makes a macho comment.
I'll discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against igualitarian marriage or the legalization of abortion.
I haven't seen the theme to keep peace.
I talk to this person.
A lot of their opinion.
And I tell her my own without shame.
And when it comes to find a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about others and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that, opinion, is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say: "Let's keep on calling."
I say everything, let's talk.
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it scares us a lot, because only talking can build our future.
and rejuvenate our present.
I hope that more and more, we begin to see marks and political spaces in general.
And not as dangerous, something that scares.
but as a space for personal and social growth.
of union and inspiration.
And I hope there's always, but there's always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look proudly.
And to say, without any surprise.
It's full of children.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours a day?
Taking a cup like this one.
To take water to your house?
Can you imagine the water inside?
Was it so polluted?
Was there this color?
The world's world crisis is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes.
And we will all have to face the future.
This is how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN.
who attended the day by global action by water, a couple of days ago in more rocks.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings.
Us?
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the manantial lakes.
Through agriculture.
From our big companies' farming?
Even our own daily activities.
Although we don't realize it.
This is not just the appearance of diseases around the world.
but it's the direct cause of the death of 1,000 children a day.
10,000?
Children per day.
According to the World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people in 2016.
They live without access to drinking water in the world.
This is what matters.
Because if we selected 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth.
At least two.
Are there serious problems?
To have access to water.
Do I have that number of people at least 60 million?
It is found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it's somehow paradoxical.
Because this continent has 35 percent of the sweet water reserves around the world.
What if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, for example in Peru.
Isn't it true?
What is octavo country with largest hydroe reserves in the world?
Do you have at least 30 percent of the population?
Without access to drinking water.
And if we go up a little further, to Mexico.
A border with the United States of America.
Where, by the way, Mr. Trump now wants to build a wall.
That they look even further in these two countries.
Almost 20 million people.
In other words, around 20% of the country's population.
She lives without clean water every day.
These are all these numbers that were looking back made us think.
How is it possible that a continent with such a natural wealth?
What are they facing this situation?
This question is exactly this question that asked four doctors to do.
Good afternoon to you.
Let's not leave everything.
We grew bad poets and got together again to bring drinking water.
thousands of people in Latin America.
And he made a mistake?
Until Peru.
Dying like this?
Raise your hand the bosses.
Now let's go.
It has a piece of self-caravan so we call the Blanca wound and, above all.
We were inherited with a tremendous desire.
to give back to the world.
The luck that we have indeed had.
By being born, where are we born?
We embarked on the adventure.
During the way we were going to meet with rural and white communities.
Classing to see have water at home.
All of them go to rivers, poths or marantials.
To be able to see.
Always.
With a common problem.
The water has this pinete.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three days to purify the cat.
Can you see it?
Do I love to or buy it directly?
Just as you are, it's a huge waste of resources.
People who almost don't have age.
How many money to buy these bidons?
Or resources in time to go pick up the sign and then avoid it.
And we asked ourselves.
Can we do it?
To help solve this problem.
Doing the basis that none of us were experts in the matter.
Raise your hand to the play.
Well, in many weeks of research.
Do we find a system?
from filtration by membrals that was perfectly adapted.
To the logistics of our project, but above all, to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to teach me how it works.
A filter that works practically like...
Following!
The contaminated water goes through the child.
And this one goes back to all particles.
(Laughter) Women who have a love molecule.
Sergio Feferovich: It's taking that crazy step, clean water.
Retening 99 percent of them.
Thank you, so harmful only to health.
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water immediately, and also, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider it.
Physics, the weight of water itself to make the title work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these filters?
In the lives of all these people?
Well, that's it.
Why?
We want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old boy.
It belongs to October 15th colony.
In Guatemala, in trinity.
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And end up being a teacher in his community, but it's funny ...
Both him, like all his poplars ...
They used a lot of money and time.
to get drinking water.
Because the handmandial that was supported was very polluted by skeptical stages around.
To our move.
Leo signed up in an English course.
You can't imagine it.
The illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see, all those...
All those people in those communities?
How did they spend a lot of their resources?
How can we fulfill among other things?
They are their dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to speak.
To describe it well.
In total?
We delivered 78 family filters.
And 14 community filters.
Destined to schools.
From now on?
More than 15,000 people.
In Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua ...
Columbia, Ecuador and Peru.
You will have access to drinking water for about 10 years.
And now, thinking, being here, thinking about two years ago.
When Guateman, why?
How will an idea come up?
Well, we realize a bit of the dream we had the opportunity to live, right?
But, in this dream?
We were never alone.
before leaving?
More than 400 people ...
They took their goal through a crowdfunding campaign.
which was destined to 100% of exclusive purchases.
Of the water filters.
And nine months later ...
Fortunately, we don't tell you for thousands, right?
Together?
We have created a social movement.
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable caravan against the world's water crisis.
But there's still a lot.
There's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the world's crisis...
Can it be one of the risks of the greater risks?
To the one facing the human being.
In the next 10 years.
According to the world's economic force, what's not that we say it?
So?
We asked ourselves the question of...
How is it possible to have reached this situation?
Why have we reached this situation?
It's not another one that has an insufficient education and information.
In Occident.
We have created a lot of necessities.
That we all know they are unnecessary.
And sometimes we don't think.
What do other people suffer?
So that we can absolutely satisfy all of them.
We, in this project.
We have seen it with our own eyes.
We've experienced it personally, we've developed a project in Mexico a few months ago.
Where have we seen?
Like big embotellers.
They were appropriating the local earthquakes that supported communities, so they were taking their entire access to water.
What do you think you are doing?
For those land.
The great oil producers.
The big oilfield -
To make us all.
Can we fill the deposit of our cars?
What they are doing here is to contaminate.
It's destroying forests and rivers.
From communities or oranis of the Amazon we've been there.
And it's amazing.
They are making the communities have to be moved.
And in the future?
This is probably going to cause.
It's that it disappears until its culture.
It's really incredible.
To me, living it hasn't left us.
What has left us open.
It's really something that...
It seems to us and we really think it seems.
That it doesn't affect any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality.
That not only.
It affects the underwhelmed countries.
The world's world crisis.
It's a reality that...
November 12th.
From 2016.
It's affecting us directly.
All of us and each one.
In this room.
It's not necessary.
They say very far away.
In California?
A world of technological development.
That is, they are multing people.
To consume too much water.
They are cutting their minister.
For several hours.
A Spain.
In Spain we also suffered drought.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
What else will the shortage of water in the future?
What if it really was?
We want to make a change.
If really...
We want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is all of us.
To recognize ourselves.
What we all have to do is to motivate ourselves.
It's learning about these problems and what we have to do is also educate all our children, all our families.
Over what are the problems and the real needs.
And with that?
What are the solutions?
Because they will really be sustainable.
What we have to do.
It is to support local projects in our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
That small NGO.
who is trying to build poems in Guatemala to display these communities.
Unfortunately, they continue without drinking water.
Because we don't try to exercise a bit of pressure.
About governments.
Who are those who can really be?
Making change.
The life these big companies would say that today.
Of course, they are not doing things right.
We have to really appreciate and value.
Is the incredible luck we have?
To reach our homes.
Open in the water turtle.
And that always leaves water.
It's not like that.
Let's stop worrying this resource.
It seems like no, but believe me.
It's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to raise awareness and act.
And we have to do it now.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness?
But we don't act.
This way we won't be able to make the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
Existen.
Many voices to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact on other people's lives.
This one.
It's our way of doing it.
What is your mind?
(Applause)
(Video) (Video)
(Applause)
The beautiful thing is to be here.
It's beautiful to see so many attentive faces.
I started the conference making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
We can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion.
And it was verified.
Emotion has a strength many times higher than thought, the electromagnetic frequency that creates a thought is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emit our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: Nenny.
Talking from the heart.
I commit myself to you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
To open your heart, you will surely receive 1,000 percent of what I'm going to say.
And that we remain trapped in our minds.
We certainly receive only one part, so that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask a quick question, especially the front lines.
To give us a context, how is society today, raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
Fast.
It stopped.
Stracked.
Revolved.
Funding, aggressive, facing a face.
An accident of tea, okay!
In my conferences, today it is...
It's 30 or 40 possibilities for me to give me this kind of answer.
You gave the answers you were given.
Here's vanity, right?
And then another question came.
Someone in this room is happy to raise your hand those who are happy.
Well, that's it.
Those who cry happy, raise your hands.
There were around 57 people here and almost everyone raised their hands.
I assure you that if I give you 100 possibilities to tell me how society is today, none of you has told me happy or happy.
Do you know what they are?
Why are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we mean, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if they'd always told us more or less questions, wouldn't they have said?
In that line.
Lost, deceived, facing, dismoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
I've never had it.
Oriented to the crisis.
When they ask us something, the first thing we say is.
Everything that's missing.
Everything that's wrong, everything we see, is tied to the media.
Information where ...
The answers we go to schools sometimes, we take the day to the kids, and we tell them, "Take good news."
bad and neutral, day money, right?
How good do you think they find or how many neutral ones?
One, two.
Now, that's it.
This is what happens to us when we naturally ask a question or an impulse of how we see society.
And then we have...
Another big problem that has to do with athletes that are fashionable, when I ask this once they say soccer, basket, rugby, not well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports that are for me, that are in fashion today, the first, national sports.
The complaint.
We complain absolutely everything.
They saw this, that is, first we leave the weather: heat that's 3rd of January 3 pm. Oh, how crazy!
How cold it's 7 of July at 7 am?
The dangers take us out of the weather after we complain...
The traffic after we leave the country, well that we stop my wife.
What if we don't complain about something?
Something is wrong.
When they ask me: "How are you perfectly well? It's a happy dish, he tells me, "What happened to you?"
"You don't complain about anything."
That is, we have become societies that jologists.
It's like a title that we have to leave everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim.
This can't be this, it has to change, this is a disaster, or this has to change.
We have to change the country, society, my wife, work, all the time we are complaining, so we transform ourselves into claims, psychologists, claims.
And the maximum: "opinologists and all achievements."
Or do we pirate with all of you and realize?
Have you ever heard of it?
That's why I don't feel able to opt.
And after that, I produced it with my friends, there's a friend Ferrando.
"I go to the shirt with him and I tell him.
"You play without drums in that place," "Oh, you know why you stay without drums," because it's the place, you see that the soup got up," you know why the soup got up?
Did you understand that pain is going down there, that time we leave everything, we opens the economy, politics, and...
And there's something more worrying, right?
We have started to have our minds oriented to the crisis.
We complain, complain.
And we are immersive in opinion.
What does it do?
We fell into a sort of vital distancing.
You saw that we came out of our house with the cell phone charged 100%, and we also took a...
It's a chargator, for doubts that it doesn't have a lot of load, but with our energy...
The "wat."
We started the day.
With a vital distancing, with a kind of fatigue.
Moreover, it makes us lose power, why if we want to be OK?
We need everything to change.
That the country feels good, that the climate might not know which, because it was recently overwhelming.
I got to give a conference and went with the rhythm, I wanted wonderful things.
And the reporter tells me: "Yes, but tomorrow it's announced to rain."
(Laughter)
This is how we are losing power and there's something that...
I want to focus on this, besides being in this society and leave this society, above all, our generation.
What have we left our society in a moral crisis that wasn't even the most perverse minds of our grandparents could imagine?
Slowing, breathing.
But it's wrong, we're making our children believe.
But we serve for nothing, that we are corrupt, lying, that the success model is famine and money, and that we don't have a future.
We don't just stop this, but we make them believe this, how this sentence is represented.
Do you see how architects are?
And what do you want?
We're in Argentina.
We hear this and if it were worldwide, do you know what we can do?
Not only do we leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in generations that, well, they can't change it.
A mistake, this is the self-fulfilling teacher.
Now, well.
For a long time I was there, I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I graduated.
That the ability was important to get out of that world I lived in, that had been complaining, which was hell.
That talent...
It was important, I had to have talent, I had to experience and I was formed more and more in this, I saw that all of them add up, all of them add up.
So I looked for more knowledge, more skill, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add up, but the attitude ...
Multiplicates.
The attitude multiplies and you know that all the amount is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
That's a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative one.
If you have a pessimistic attitude, that's a pessimistic guy.
And if you have a deserved attitude, that's a type of merd.
Sorry.
So I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude?
To get out of this position and the first thing I saw was that nothing changed, it only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change my attitude and which was to get out of that state of victim that had of all that happened to me and I started deciding to be the protagonist of my life.
I started deciding.
What was he going to do?
Who searches for the changes I wanted to see?
I left the victim's attitude all the time being justified, criticizing, rooting and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw was that the installing protocol is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a square meter, depends on you, nobody else than you.
And for me, and you see what here in this square meter, I vibrate with the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world.
With one...
Aisa that says "free."
I don't care what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to congratulate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see.
I started to decide to live in a different world because living hell.
I went through hell, I remembered once I went to the subway and I told him, "Miss, give me three reasons for which I should keep living, wow, it was very bad!"
I was in the winter and he gave in paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, mine, in love, full.
But hell and paradise is not a place.
It's a decision, because I have hell there next to me, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I start to see everything I lack and not everything I have.
When it begins to claim all the time and opt all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates like I want and you know that one is what you do, but it's also what stops doing.
If we'll always be waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the man in my theater.
That is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
This is not all the same possibilities, we don't all have the same possibilities.
I started to educate.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's just one.
With the example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, these are the ways to educate, being the image of what we want to see, starting from our square meter to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I am the main character of my life.
I am the one I want to change things. Being a protagonist is the people in change, it's not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my square meter to be sympathetic, to start emitting.
It filled with optimism, because do you know what with the people who vote together, you were telling you?
And you're with a group of pessimists, it's a nightmare.
If you're with a group of failures, that's a failure, that makes you a group of unhappy, that's an unhappy.
And you start with your square meter, contagiating solidarity, optimism, and I started to emit that energy. Why?
What energy does your square meter have for me?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, to me, the important thing is that what we do with all the love of the world.
In Pasco was to buy a kilo of side, it doesn't matter here to be advertising.
And I tell the girl: "People Wars" and she tells me: "These people were born and I, in the first time, made me happy.
And I say to him, "Hey, hippie about 300 happy people, why?"
No, he tells me.
What are you waiting for?
What are you emitting, your square meter, complain?
What do you lawyer for?
A respect?
You respect, emite encounter, emits gratitude.
It emits unconditional love, what is emitting, what it does, because we are a source of energy and according to what you met, it's what you receive.
This is like AMCM, if you're in AM and you go from one coast of AM to the other side, you'll listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody.
And it's more, in the female, to have the long lines.
The frequency you want to hear, you can choose.
But if you are in the DM, even if you go from one end to the other, you'll listen to it.
In other words, the world is how we created it.
They live in paradise, but hell is a decision, I get up in the morning and I begin to say, "The first game is playing against myself."
"Oh, I'm up, I don't get up."
Well, I wake up, what had a progress done with humour, or with good humor?
Yes!
It's a bad humor, or not, like in humor.
I always say "prepared predisposed," I see everything I have or I see everything I lack.
They are all decisions, all small differences, excellence, created media, this difference, the path you take is a blind one.
Since you wake up.
His victims and the protagonists.
You will show what you want to build for the generations that come or you will make the interests that today are governing us and taking us out of domesticated nostress.
People drive it for fear.
My father left me a huge heritage, she always told me: "Plata and fear I never had."
Well.
At least no, let's be more and more safe.
I'm going to share two life experiences.
With this Dalbis Fronteras Foundation, the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we did, they were going to happen. We gathered veterans of war with Argentinians and Christians, a role to the British sea, a burk.
And they gathered with Argentine veterans and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
And do you know who closed the conference in my 12-year-old nephew, do you know what he said?
It works for lives, that a measuring unit is that.
And they taught me that they were the bad guys and now I see that bad guys suffered as much as the good ones.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, 12 years old, and a blind is born.
I invite you to see it and I'm going to tell you two life stories.
And I had the blessing ...
Living with the Prakuis Foundation without Borders was, in 2012, I went to work tank of gas to a conflict between realities and prestigious realities that took 70 years.
A place where I was in carency, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
And I understood what.
All the time I was worried about what was missing, and one morning I see a Palestine woman was the city of Belén, come and embraces another lady and celebration, there's no celebration.
They are celebrating.
So the translator says to me: "The water tank was filled."
What does this mean to tell you so much that I do?
And it has drinking water at home to take the whole week.
If you're celebrating that, their family will be able to drink water.
They celebrated it, right?
And in the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask her?
Do you know what the lamparadian genius is through the translator?
And...
They told me, "I have no idea."
I do explain to him what that genius is in the lamp of the ladine.
And I tell her, "I work with you, what do you ask me?"
"My follower looks at me, everything moved."
(Laughter)
Doing my hot water bathroom?
Like their great desire, right?
I'll give you that moment.
All the time was connected with what was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had never had to think if I would have water to drink.
And if I could give a bathroom, if I would have one?
Where to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but my attitude had changed.
I stopped being in the world of lack, I was in the world of abundance and I realized everything I had, right?
And to finish this, with this story, I want to propose an exercise all of you in this state that we are now.
It will take three steps in the exercise.
The first step is the first step.
I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
I wanted in my eyes.
Imagine right now.
All the things we have to never give them.
The value we don't give them importance, like the fact of having a place to sleep, to bathe, have water.
We started making a mental list.
Of the things we never realize or we thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
It's like our senses, our friends.
How many things there are?
We give them for assault, but we never see them...
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do.
With all the people in this room...
Now you feel, what have you been?
And...
You read or selected.
Or chose by all you have, all the people who feel deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until this moment.
that express that gratitude.
Setting standing, applauding the strongest thing you can shout, doing what you want, the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life, if you feel it right now.
From that moment on, I start standing and applause to me strongly, we are in a society in a very well-being moment, very up there, very well, for the love of our life, for what we have, for what we receive, above all, these gratitude we can do in our lives, can do what we unite and strong.
Keep there for a moment.
The longest way to go?
There are four stadiums when we get rid of our heads.
We connect with our heart or our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Everything we have and not everything we lack.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
but it's a decision.
We manage to turn off the turbo for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to anchor in this moment.
What did we just feel and this feeling?
And that every day of your life, when you are going to give.
A shower.
Do you remember that?
Is there a place in a 10-year-old boy?
Is the genius of Aradin's lamp?
He asks it.
And what you're going to start doing.
And that's when you realize it.
That we can choose the path where we are going to travel.
If we were going to the hell, or if we were going to paradise.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Music is to awaken the inner world and share it with others.
And you don't need to be an instrumentist or a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us.
Since we are born in Latin.
In bones, in rhythms.
The Sun goes out on the moon, my life!
But music also lives in the pauses.
In silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language.
It integrates worlds, since we are little and we play with sound as if it were a toy, Pach!
Until we grow up and bring music with us.
And it also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go all together and grow in community.
Music?
It generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
so that we can welcome ourselves, say goodbye.
A classicator, games and songs.
Welcome.
(Applause) (Music)
(Music)
(Applause)
Believe me, it's not easy.
To love, sometimes.
Can you imagine then what bullying must be?
bullying, those physical or verbal aggressions.
What do schools usually happen for that too?
Like school support.
And it's one of the most argued and serious problems of recent times, not social problems.
However, it's been 5 or 10 years ago.
I think few of us had heard this word "bullying".
Although it's also usually saying that this is nothing new.
What is it?
It always happened.
And, in fact, beyond the age we have, we have an experience with this type of situations, that is, why?
We say goodbye to our own meat.
Or why?
We trained to exercise it against our own colleagues, telling our poor, friends of that time, in childhood.
Or because we simply presence it, before it was called...
Take some point to someone to get buried.
Now, that is bullying.
Well, but I believe that what happens now and that we call bullying, is actually something new.
You have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
I have several reasons.
First, we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
It wasn't news, the media were not discussed, it didn't try to promote laws to cure it or to criminalize it.
Of course it could be a cause of suffering for many people, and in fact it was.
But we thought it was something more or less normal.
Is there an unwanted consequence, an lateral effect?
Or the undesirable task of school coexistence.
But not that serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to the children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that, at that same time, or even, not so long ago.
Others screams.
It was considered much more serious.
No matter how much they would happen in recess and hallways.
I'm talking about amonestations, expulsions, even bad grades.
Therefore, children, teachers, parents and society in general, believed that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now going out, they tend to do the opposite, right?
The bad grades and the disciplinary repriments, seem to be increasingly serious.
Less serious, sorry.
And this is a new bullying phenomenon, it occupies a more and more central role.
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time, not on one side.
These are the most important reasons.
Raditional ones of school humiliation.
They are the scenarios applied by an authority, as a teacher.
Or a directive.
Students did something considered incorrect.
Something forbidden by regulations, or something considered that it shouldn't be done.
How to behave bad or not?
On the one hand, that loses weight.
And on the other hand, they earn new priorities.
They are school humiliation reasons, which are these castings.
Because the same students apply to each other.
With the most diverse reasons, but almost always because of something related to physical appearance or personality of the victim.
Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a big historical change.
A big historical change about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional school conflicts.
Amonestations, expulsions, bad grades.
What operates there is fault.
It's guilty for having done something wrong, something bad.
Guilt is an internal, private emotion.
It refers to a moral conflict, to a drama of each and himself.
For having done something not only the regulations.
It's forbidden that it shouldn't be, it's because it's incorrect.
I know everyone think that's wrong.
Between that, me.
I feel guilty because I did something wrong.
(Laughter) Now, in the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's at stake.
but another kind of emotion.
embarrassment.
Because it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
It doesn't refer to a private drama of each one for himself, for having done something bad, something bad.
In the case of embarrassment.
The problem is not me.
But not the others.
All the rest.
The look of others.
What judges me?
It has been an incorrect and just way, sometimes cruel.
Beyond being guilty or not having done something bad, in general, I'm not guilty of anything, it's the others that exercise my cruel look.
So?
It's a transformation, and I believe that this is our balance information, it becomes more important to us embarrassment than fault.
And I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Or it seems to me that the alien look, the look of the other ...
Obviously, it was always important.
Lately, he has won a demeasurable weight maybe disappointed.
And above all, when we judge, who is each one and how much it is?
And this wasn't always the case.
That's why I say it's a big historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, which isn't from now on, which has been gesting for decades.
And that's finishing of consuming now, it's crystallizing now.
And I think one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the inner idea.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a belief.
Fundamental?
During the 200 years they previous us.
This century made 9 out of 20.
Yes!
The conviction that the inner life existed.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes.
That creates that defined each one in a much deeper and true way.
What are they going to appear?
Those appearances.
Not only were they considered wine.
but also fake, submissive.
As something lower, something without importance, compared to all the dissemination.
That truth or inner beauty.
(Laughter) Well, I think all of this...
These are values and beliefs that still remain among us, but what?
We are abandoning them.
I'm in Suetak.
Transforming and we are abandoning those beliefs.
For example, in the case of good appearances I find it pretty clear.
They count wine.
No, let's think of the whole phenomenon of culto to the body that was developed in the last decades.
The importance of personal image, physical aspect, gymnastics, esthetic treatments, all that.
(Sigh) It also matters a lot, if it's called "Sinfrase" every time, it's what you see.
And this notion is lost that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that are not the trips, not that they are inside each one, but that are not the trips but something immaterial.
Like the soul or the spirit.
It seems that we increasingly believe less.
And more and more, in what others can see.
But what do we show what we do?
And according to these changes.
The others judge us from what they give.
And less from that notion that there is something inside, eternal and aerial innerity, half Victoria, an anti-vacada ana, which would be more true in Ox.
Together with this?
A series of indices of transformations appear.
And one of them would be self-management.
How are the optical tactics of self-production?
Today they are everywhere.
And that, until recently, it was considered a bad taste.
No, but let's think of an example.
The conquest, the obsession to conquer the greater number of followers or "I like."
Isn't it?
This also to prove that you are someone who exists and who has value and deserves to be admired.
All the phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms.
contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos.
Until plastic surgeries.
What's going on in reality shows?
And why bullying?
I think that thinking about this broader context doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious today.
It's so serious.
When amonestations and bad grades?
They are increasingly low.
Because it seems the fault.
And he lost a good part of his moralizing effect.
That is, fault is no longer so effective.
Like embarrassment.
To produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, an administration.
Of two?
Patients that seem contradictory on one side.
Do we have to expose ourselves?
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are.
And what do we do?
So we have to grow and share our image.
But on the other hand, there is always the risk.
To make that alien look.
You become a admiration.
but a rejection, a burrow.
Ignorance also ignores us.
So, we have not become more vulnerable to the alien look, for the same reason.
Let's also think about the complication of cyberbullying when these mothers are...
Or spreading.
They disseminate on social media, YouTube, Facebook, etc.
So, what they used to be private before was to limit the group of acquaintances or...
I've traveled all the walls of the school or the house, suddenly.
It puts itself in front of millions of people, everyone knows it.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, much more serious.
And...
We don't have where to take refuge.
Not inside yourself.
I had the intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping an island somehow.
And more and more?
That it's less or there's no more, at least not without Wi, which is the subject.
So, it seems that this idea that hell is us.
And it has become more real now, in the era of permanent connection.
And the profiles are always visible in thousands of screens.
And with this dependence we developed.
With respect to the button I like.
This is the click that marked.
Why do we wait for everything to conceive us before any selfie or whatever we post?
Well, that's how all this is happening in fact this historical change.
With these consequences and effects, the question would be ...
"But, what do we do?"
This is better or worse than before, it's good or bad.
How do we solve it?
And well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution.
But I think I have some clues before.
Or does fault sound as embarrassment?
They are mechanisms of social control.
And the fact that guilt is losing most of its work now.
And that shame is magnificating?
Everything is not good or animal in itself.
But it's something we have to keep in mind.
That's a fact.
Because we continue, which means things changed in fact, right?
So, if we keep thinking.
What happens now is the same thing that happened before.
And we try to solve it as if it were the same.
We'll probably not go very far.
That's what he wanted to tell.
(Laughter) (Applause)
breast, breast, breast, well.
(Applause)
(Applause) So we talked with my kids at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
That we wouldn't forget these days.
And he let me tell us.
Mamm, I want to live in a historical moment.
But for the good ones.
I work to investigate their education and I feel that the pandemic put us in strength in a sort of global educational experiment that is forcing us, without wanting.
To explore, what happens?
In a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
And nowadays I've come to think a lot about this.
Is there something we can learn?
This educational scenario we don't choose.
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
And I would like to share three of those ideas that spinning around me.
In these days and that I hope, in one of those...
They serve us to keep thinking about the education of here, ahead.
The first is that for the first time, all of us and all teachers together have the urgency of animals to test new ways of teaching.
Innovation and education is something close to what is being talked about.
But that until one was happening isolately, separated.
And from one day to another, all of us, at the same time, we had to help take a huge step.
With a lot of effort and an obligation for emergency.
Those of us who dedicate ourselves to teaching are having to rediscover our classes at a distance.
And in that process ...
We are encouraging us to test new ways of doing things.
And for that we realized that there wasn't.
I had even had to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things already available.
The urgency in periods needs to use.
tutorials, online books, remote learning platforms.
Social, media, video games.
So it gives them a result to keep teaching.
And especially to keep connecting with students, with families.
They are now, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this I think.
Once we tried them, we use them.
These strategies are already set up.
They start to be part of what we know how to do.
It's our complaint of tools.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings.
To have to adapt them so fast.
Even trying to have patience, we do the same when things don't leave too, because we're also learning.
What are we holding our taste?
Take new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching online what they know from yoga lessons.
Until fabrics workshops.
Even people with the vocation of teaching are encouraging healthy, as you don't know, are you older in these days.
He started to show how the compound is.
For that, bankers, people of their age.
We're learning in community.
The second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year, we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school.
Just like it appeared once and again.
The boys and girls always tell us that the school I dreamed -
Do I have it?
A space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn.
And when and how?
Suddenly, one day for another, that's happening.
Today, many families began to realize that many times children, especially when they are teenagers.
Learn better when they can organize their own times.
Some study more at night.
Others start with the subjects that are most interested in.
Others connect with their classmates to do the task, or a change on the web, to end up understanding something that doesn't happen to them.
Or to learn the new ones who wanted to.
This also helps us think about the education from here on.
Because it makes us see that those moments of autonomy of children.
You can combine with other instances in which we are all together working to the parade.
And she also tells us that for all boys and girls to take advantage of these most autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
For a thousand youngsters.
organizing their time.
Making the tasks and everything that requires learning to learn.
And my last reflection...
It's more of a question.
What happens when, as happens?
These days.
We don't have physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is making us realize, but not in a theoretical, statistic way, but skin in our body.
The value of the school and the huge task they are doing and that teachers do every day.
When boys and girls cannot go to school.
It disappears stronger than ever, as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children at school's tasks.
It's as if this is happening these days.
We realize it.
But difficult, what is being a good teacher?
This pandemic is becoming more visible, it's never the differences between home.
It's not just those who have a computer and those who don't, those who have the Internet, those who don't.
He is the one who has a calm place to study and not.
And they have here to ask and not.
The one who has to be all the tasks of care in the house.
And the one that doesn't.
The school.
With all their difficulties, at least one would leave at least.
Think between parentheses these inequalities and help all boys and girls.
They are protected.
And focused on this.
It's learning.
As an educator, I'm very concerned about how this will follow.
And I also wonder what will remain of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling is...
Did you see when you go to the tide and you stay the naked beach?
Among everything that devastates that tide.
But, what do I break?
What is taken.
Also on the beach there were some treasures hidden.
I wish that, even though, as my son said.
This historical moment isn't for the good ones.
It helps us do our own.
Those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
We relate to the use of time and we have to learn and also.
Let's realize how much we need as a society.
From school and teachers.
Audience: Yes.
Physics are closed, but...
In one of those I'm opening a door to keep building.
Between all of us.
When all this happens.
It's an education we dream of.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too two months and suddenly ...
We got used to living like this.
That the banks improved the fight and that everything could be paid by the phone.
That the trucks with food and drinks and medicines traveled by the route, remote control.
Conduced by truck drivers in cells.
From his home.
that doctors work for telecomedicine, the patient at home.
The doctor in yours, X-rays, the cheering and good nights.
That education worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up in 7 aM to study sleeped media.
I dreamed that the State workers could finally understand the functioning of vulnerability.
That motorcycles learned to be cyber-attack.
that mythomans and chisms ...
They were released in the spread of conspiranóid news through social media.
And those who bought pulsions before, the pangphiles, the naive.
They shared those lies with their friends.
That all commercials worked for dislivering and dreaming.
That you could vote from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week you could vote from home, abortion yes or abortion, we appreciated a button.
Marquana free, yes, or Margó la Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then we always earned most of a day for the other quickly.
Without Northern administrators, or theoretical deputies, deciding the place of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also an online one.
The tables were given by YouTube curas.
And, of course, it was forbidden to emigrate them.
For "I touch".
I dreamed that an algorithm supported the lawyers and the judges.
And that, from one day to another, all of you who have ever had rights...
They had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
Through Google EAT.
And what about in the end?
We got used to buying in the neighborhood's businesses.
And that we had the line in the street, automatically by taste, always saving a meter and a half away with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbor we greet them from afar.
With the chest.
I dreamed that we would become monogos, but really.
And that lonely people looked for love in the neighborhood quickly and started to coexist because the same thing they had before.
We hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that the Unitarians who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected each other, because we realized they would think all day in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
No, I dreamed that addicts had recovered.
Or that they did addicts to something else.
I dreamed that we had to see TED talks from home and do it from home.
And that it didn't last 18 minutes, but it lasted 6 minutes.
I dreamed that the State would send us a 3D printer to each and buy imported products.
I dreamed that at night, in the big cities.
The stars would come back to see themselves again.
They were doors like in the field.
And that in the field.
They proliferated, all of a sudden, wild hair and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day ...
Many months later.
The government announced the end of the pandemic.
In a very short communicator, the president told the people that it was possible to go out to the street.
That you could make a normal life, leave being the president, occupy your jobs.
They leave their house.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that an avestruz crossed July 9th.
And that we all went out like crazy in the street.
And we walked to the avestruz.
To make a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We suffocated it.
And we killed it.
And that a truck without sloppers.
I crossed against the snail of the struggle and it fly.
And tons of wine cards fell down.
And that more people came out of their house.
In the street.
Take selfies out with the dead avestruz and steal wine.
And there were screams.
And soon someone pointed another and the journalists showed up again.
To transmit the live massacre and then over salt, I woke up.
And I discovered that we continue in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Isn't it that when you see a picture?
Sometimes, there are people who are a little nicer, but who appear a little bit more ugly in the picture, or people who are a bit more ugly in the picture and who seem lovely?
(Laughter)
That fact always caught my attention, because if you think there's photogeneration.
It means that photography can't end with live portrait, it can't display it.
So a few years ago I started actively.
To draw.
Do we add the idea of what?
When you draw, you draw.
What you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So I already embraced that challenge, to see with detenation.
To figure out the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimulation of what we are capturing.
No, and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go for a walk or visit a place with few friends on Facebook that we draw.
And we use ourselves as a lab.
And we verified that a line is a turning point.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
We have to look closely at the visible.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom: "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in just 30 seconds?"
He told me a little.
And just like I did, I felt challenged and I decided to try it.
If I could get to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds.
I would eat the last or invited with a cream that remained in life.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
I wrote a lyrics to random and I entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until the Kar, I started seeing everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, about a month ago, had uploaded a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people behind, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, everybody singing the happy birthday.
So I assumed I was a very friendly person.
Among his publications there were some pieces of art and benches and I said, "This girl likes art."
Something that later I confirmed with some photos in which she seemed to paint.
All of that was going down and I discovered.
The one who is currently an object was his best friend.
This is a transvest girl who inherited school last year and who is now studying graphic design.
And among all that, I could also see that it's a healthy person, that touches him and takes care of him, that is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had already happened 28 seconds.
My mom was very shocking.
I couldn't believe that I could know a person like that, through social networks.
It's true that in social networks each one chooses what they want to show.
but because it's there, it means that it's something 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people, compared to how we did it a few years ago.
Before, all I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To go from a general idea, that person will know details.
Today, thanks to social networks, that became completely and the other way around.
And something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can first know the details of the person as their personalities, their tastes, their families, their friends.
And after all that, we make a general image of the person.
Understanding this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant.
Multicultural and it has a great social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered on social networks.
An example is like with the girl I found on Instagram.
I didn't play it for being a trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it.
Or why does she choose to show us their reality?
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see in others helps me ask myself what I'm seeing in the world.
After making these species of challenge with my mother, I came back to see some publications that had called my attention, like those that talked about taking care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself: What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it?
And if it's like that, how am I going to do it?
While I was talking to my mom and I was eating very deserved, invites with a cream.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds our meetings come from day to day.
And that's when I realized that this different way of meeting other people on social networks.
It transformed the screens and it's present in my daily meetings.
My behavior in the real world, so to say it, changed completely.
When I meet someone I don't know, I don't look for a label to fit it.
I try to get to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those I spoke to you at the beginning.
I ask everything and without playing.
(Applause) And, obviously, I ask your user in social media, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
But pay attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face do you think?
What are you looking at?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first after that.
You surely have all happened at some point.
The eyes.
In different parts of the face.
You will have stopped somewhere.
Effectively.
Some artists like Alberto Jaco Metti, or Leonardo da Vinci.
Did you know that the eyes were not the only relevant element to build?
The look of a portrait.
But it's also true.
The nazy sacrifices, the mouth commissors, the borders of their ears.
The pores and details are useless.
Grad fundamental elements to form what we would call.
The look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these people knew.
Look!
They were the faces side that the spectators searched.
And developing a portrait, they showed evidence to a subjectivity through the Constitution of a Mirada.
And at the same time, she's looking for.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought about it.
What would it be if we could see how a spectator came about?
In a research team in a neuroscience laboratory, we put several portraits.
Many people.
And we recorded the movement of the eyes.
And in front of that image.
What we get.
It's how we build the image in time.
How?
Our eyes select specific parts of that face.
To extract information, as the rest ...
It doesn't constitute the brain.
What if we make all the images together with all of them?
Looking at them together in the image we could see which relevant parts.
It's time to put together.
The portrait, and what is it not?
Somehow, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter, of that look, of the portrait, that we just talked about.
And the look of the spectators.
Had we thought about thinking then?
How would it be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks together?
The look of others.
We built it.
Of course, today I am showing you and I want to share with you.
This tremendous rehearsal for the journey of an eye.
It's one, let me love a stranger.
Some of the projects led together to Mariano Sigman.
In the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think of them in a way as a journey.
A journey through different landscapes.
Sumbres.
It was guided more.
In which we travel with some art maps and several leaves in the field of science, but fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The abuse of pregnancy.
The questions?
Inspire.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
Audience: Good afternoon!
(Music) (Applause)
At the exact moment in which we are born?
We start to get old.
Aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However.
It's the most resistant.
We invented so many resources in living more and more years.
And even so?
It seems that it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why?
A few years ago.
When I started working on longevity issues.
Many people asked me.
What are you so young taking care of old people?
It's my future, I answered it.
I want to live for many years and that's how I go.
What they didn't say at that time.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
No!
Fear?
Let's live in a society?
Where is the most important thing?
Is it being?
Or seem young.
Fear?
What is my knowledge and my experience?
They keep losing value.
That my word...
It hasn't taken into account.
Miedo.
Let's go to the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
discrimination by age is the most widespread in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
Stereotypes linked to age are socially accepted.
We can see them.
In publicities, in labor searchs.
In the jokes we make.
And the worst of all.
It's that many times.
We don't notice them.
Or we let them pass.
These stereotypes block older people.
Let's see some generalizations that put everyone in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people ...
They are ill or depend on others.
When the data of the vetor of social debt tell us that 70 percent of older people today in Argentina.
They are self-beatable.
Does it mean that they can take care of themselves?
And to take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
that the elderly are sad or depressed.
when it's 80 percent.
It can be happy.
And that's much more than what I see in the people of my age or even younger.
Or this passive class label.
The passive class.
Who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many elderly working today, they are creating.
What are you doing sports participating in volunteers?
Taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and have an enormous impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think about a person carrying out a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know?
It's hard for a person.
5 more?
Do you get a credit or funding for your project?
Even when it is demonstrated.
That the projects where people get involved have more chances of success.
However.
I've never found it.
Not a scholarship.
And a call.
Not even a funding opportunity.
That includes it.
Another example: the vaccines that exist in the health field.
Most of the public universities in our country.
There's no matter of generatry.
Medical students are formed to treat young adults.
Not old.
Everything related to aging is just a theme.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity that we suffer from achieving?
Or what's going on with university teachers in any field?
that in the 70s are invited to be retired by age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit?
This happened to the 69s.
You can teach them.
And at 71 no.
The media is not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, at a meeting with an important national average, I asked them.
Why each time they treat the issue of older people using the same photo?
That one.
from the older person in a park, giving them eat to the dove.
Do you place it?
It's the only thing we have in an archive, it was the answer.
And so bad media has old age.
In addition to images, there are words missing us.
older adults.
Third age.
Really.
My folks are the pieces.
Gerant.
Ansians.
I still don't find a word.
That identify the conformity to everyone.
Is it the only one that suggests to avoid?
Is it grandfather or grandmother?
It's something your grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But if it's affectionate.
You could say "my" because you're a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't matter.
The elderly people.
They have a name.
It's like everyone.
Stereotypes.
They stimulate them.
They grow.
And they become invisible to many.
Today in Argentina.
There are 6 million people over 60 years old.
In 2050, there will be older than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
Are we now?
A old society.
And don't we want to see ourselves?
Neither accept ourselves.
If we assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
to create jobs.
To design new products and services.
This new longevity.
It opens up new doors for us to rethink the next years of economic, social and cultural.
And I'll give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three elderly people says they are needs of recreation and entertainment, they are little or not satisfied.
Or if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and training.
However.
Office and education proposals exist.
They are thought, almost exclusively.
For children and young people.
We can't detect all these opportunities intuitively.
Because the elderly.
They are a very different group.
That doesn't respond to the traditional patterns we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Do we listen and learn from older people?
To really understand?
What are your new needs?
Our new possibilities?
of blind people.
And you like it.
A while ago, I interviewed a older person.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to be activities with people at their age or with younger people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each step in life.
It has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to accept our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Why old?
They are not the others.
Feelings.
We are the ones who are going to do.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
