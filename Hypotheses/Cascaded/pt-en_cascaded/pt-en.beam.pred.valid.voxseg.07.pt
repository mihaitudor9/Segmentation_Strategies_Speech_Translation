I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What was this saying?
That the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox.
And our children are what we have the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and, however, our children come from maltratted to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
Audience: Oh!
What if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, who are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat them with violence.
And if they rebel, we ...
And we offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
I want us to go on a small trip about seven capital pecates that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll get through Gabriela's wave, a typical middle class child.
Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth, that moment of affection link with her daughter to receive, along with her husband, this baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal birth, and rapidly the hospital's medical industry, the certainty that is very convincing, so convincing, that produces the culture of blinding culture, a culture that women believe that normal birth must be accessible.
According to 15 to 20% of the countries involved, this generates huge benefits for children. This makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical acute, with a woman is donated, imobilized, of course, she can be humanized and can be well done, but certainly won't have the same benefits as the normal impact.
And remembering that, of course, there are necessary cablets for each of these sines that we'll write.
And we are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working, will tell reality, "Here, you can take that a mammal is a formula like this, of milk in grandma, the case of her, she goes home more safe, arrives home, her grandma, her mother, which business you're alive, is outside.
The child is crying, the tolerator is dark, in two months this child is in a nursery, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a large part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: prize, ex-person.
Suprim, and breast milk is money, it's for, it's breastfeeding, but it just comes with a lot of love, and it's infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industries make the advertisement directly to the doctor, making a doctor their marriage, convinced of their nutritional qualities, in congressions, and sponsoring entirely the medical societies, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatric, which end up unconsciously being one of the greatest causes of dismission in Brazil, and in this way we'll lose.
The privileges in my breastfeeding and searching through the first sin, which is the privation of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
And my Gabriela grows, her mother will finish license, she will have to go to the bucket, because vovement can't take care of it.
And she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, but to get home, parents are tired of tiredness, in a long work day, and they're going to live with her daughter, and they'll take babies because, after all, when no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what's most precious in childhood, unlikely to our children, we often regret their adolescence, and the child loses the relief to the most important people of their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of this terrible peculiar of childhood's personalization.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food in fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar excess.
Crossing abroad, all the weapons that the industry, through highly developed food engineering, makes children completely addicted to industrialized food and, thus, unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
(Laughter) It's not because they're awesome.
This brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, that we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, because it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we're worldwide consumption champions.
This is the sin inxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and someone knows that highly negative of the involvements of a child.
It has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run, hide, go out, and, however, in our urban life, it doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid of leaving the child to leave, she's at home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, she huggs me, and doesn't want everyone to get in touch.
So these children spend eight, guys, being a statistic.
Eight to ten hours connected with their devices today, again, connecting with the wall to play, it's great, but not eight hours later, children have no right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
We looked at Janela, and saw a landscape passing in the form of meditation. However, today, two babies and two tablets for each one, if we can't do anything in the car, even in moments, that exists, people.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child needs the most - this exists, it comes from there, but you can say, "Ipórico," "Ipote."
This is the name, IPOR, which still comes with a layer to cover the tablet if you don't look at the pork, even in the moments when it most needs awareness, that's what we offer to her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and preventing them to have a moment of awareness, TED, fundamental, in childhood.
Because TED and void are bercers of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination, and we are amputing this from our children with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
And Gabriela watches four hours of TV per day, she is massacrated by advertising, she is more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because we have less time in school.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, not to the park, and the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family today comes week, which is "O".
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, by consumerism values, and this advertising is a cubed obesity, it is an obesity that explodes in its capacity, to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
What explodes her love by characters, doing what she ...
It falls in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, according to love, and that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
And in obesity, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, it's not people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind it, it's obviously the one who needs most friendship are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by child consumerism.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises, to relax this stress, they add more to a class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate on the little square, people on the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who has no meditation in the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." There is no better meditation than that!
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: "Merodization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating eroodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we have eight, ten years old, this sin of autization of the end to childhood and erootization for which?
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put her on trono, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she goes wrong in school, the school's fault needed, you see the present.
And she realizes that it's more and more that her parents don't have authority: a child, sometimes, two or three years old, that realizes that parents don't have authority, we need people who lead their lives, that leads to anxiety and generates symptoms; we know that the importance of limits aren't fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability, instead, we're doing what the Americans call "hélicopprinting."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world, making them not have their experience, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, with pain, with difficulty, that the world will certainly give them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the very easy super-power: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, hurts, and will get sick, eat too much, it'll be obese, it's going bad at school, it doesn't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it.
And it's not possible for these children in this way.
The same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What's the solution we're not going to give to evilted children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, it's called "medicalization and the worst iny."
The quino de Mafalda says this: "Franced in a wonderful way, telling the story of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people going badly by our children, not only with the ideal children, the adults also, in a way, are ashamed.
Medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are as big as the black one with this individualistic society, right?
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, just like medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and imperativity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood, we're rooting, norming and preventing children to be themselves, and I'm sure some of these geniuses, in humanity, had today in school.
It would be exactly this: rooted or not martized, and we would have sympathetic his genius and we would have lost that wonderful thing we had of bringing.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but for all problems, complex problems of humanity, as a philosopher said, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
What we think about this: a well-established TEDx solution, I'm already going through and going to spend my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, and penitence today means a lot of money in almost all churches, the décimo is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, who are our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays?
Our most important capital is time.
In time?
We have 17 hours of surveillance.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40, a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing, and if it doesn't happen in the weekends, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fourteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not good for the cat to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
Yes, right?
I'm sure it's the greatest one of you.
And this demonstrates a little the importance of nature between us, and nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul, we know what makes us healthy, not a doctor, hospital, medicine, these factors are all of us, we know this.
What don't we know and had an interesting experience?
I started with Patricia, who back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible?"
I talked about convergence, health and sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment, everything that does well the environment and vice versa: riding a bike, makes the body good, my cities, pollution, collective transport, makes good for the time of relief, reductive.
Look how wonderful!
And, when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about condemnical spaces with "gourmir," "fitness," and now there'll be a "gourmir space," we're talking, before jumping the wall, and to embrace cities, it'll give us moments of awareness, especially for children, to reduce consumption of excessive material, psychological, mental well-being, and play in the squares.
Soccupying public spaces, games, love, affection, and involvement, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly that.
And not only the initiative to use physics, it was seen, reinvinating for this reason that public policies that facilitate us with public space with nature, that promoted the cycle.
Free events, these steps: neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "copaque" used earlier for resistance and citizens, and mainly it means to take public space with joy, because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas based on public interest, sustainability, and equity.
To conclude, the same scientists, who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, that's coming here, will come very early, our children will pick me up, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, that there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to the relief, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold caching, not seeing YouTube, we learn more about this box, and they defend in the future, that we only defend what we're doing, so, in summary, this is our proposal, let's take public spaces, with play, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I refuse to show a phase of the gallery side that left us that year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so why does the utopia do not make us walk?
What does it make us walk outside.
AC: In 2007.
AC: I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disabilities, excluded from regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
AC: To be able to discuss inclusion within school.
With their parents.
With their children and their partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
Pommunity.
It's for society in general.
People with disabilities -
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
I don't have friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
VR: To have friendship.
AG: To interact with people.
What's the case of student Igor, for example?
And what did he study at the other school?
AC: For four years he didn't go into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't have the strength either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education and, as he loved to run, he kept running all the time.
AC: Cheging isn't a clean field.
I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
What for him to do?
They improved the best learning.
The school?
For me, it was a place.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
And today he's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And you can teach the student to heal.
The learning process itself.
The schools think.
They are not able to assist these students and they are not prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
He needed to use it.
And I believed.
(Laughter) What are they capable and that these children inside the school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do well to other students.
For the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see possibilities.
From the learning of others.
AC: Why is school like that?
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people.
So, they can see it.
And I learn.
You can know.
My hearing?
AC: I live with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs.
With those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
AC: It's learning the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you: when I was a kid, I loved seeing my grandma cooking in mine.
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Paáscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that, until today, she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen, is the act of cooking?"
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and, with it, I realized that food had powers, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that used food as a form of prevention and treatment of diseases as a form of medicine.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system.
Through food.
I believe that...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
It's the detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Trossé is a little from the rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way that we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's able to reestructure the food system, change the dynamic of food.
The production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example.
There are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces, the cheaper it produces.
Even worse is quality, and the cost of the environment and for our health in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated, the animal's life cycle is artificially accelerated, and it starts to grow and produce in a way that his bodies ...
It's a time that doesn't hold, and it begins to decrease drastically its quality of life, its health and time of life.
So I believe we can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilogram, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex, right?
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very... Each Brazilian consumes around 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society ...
There are inverted values, there's an alertical investment, because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what chemistry there is inside.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
And why is that?
So I wanted to understand and discover what this change of values is, and we need to teach people.
The value of organic products, because when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, a bit of organic leface, you're paying not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of you, with all affection, and took this lettuctuce to you, so we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution isn't efficient, I think you must know that we produce a lot of food, a third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
And in terms of consumption, the way we consume food today is frightening: my grandmother is Pulista, she lives in São Paulo.
What if I took her, put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue?
I'm sure that it's to be very scared, seeing those executives or those depressed people, walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because it's something that people think is a waste of time, but it's also very important to feed.
And it's ...
And then?
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for that, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we end up opening space to the street, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo Huriaçúcar," which are the three, the altrugicious, right?
And these, mainly, wisdom farmers end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a physiological dependency, that is, industrialized products in excess is very harmful, and they end up creating a physical dependence, but also a mental dependence, a psychological dependency, but it won't feed you.
And those of you who are still a cake, instead of buying that little package little package ... Look, half ... (Laughter) Who here still makes a pick of bread, who takes little bread in the place of microwonds, look also half a half.
This question may seem a little harmless, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the panel's popcorn from microwonds' popcorn, from a packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrialized products is very...
Initial preference.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think this dynamic is a lot to feed this food system.
It's not easy, it's not working, and we have to change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
Think about it.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
cooking brings independence, bringing autonomy, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
And I hope it's not an industry.
It's because they don't cook, they simply process food, so if you let the industry feed you?
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, chicken dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we are ...
"Ah! I don't know
Keep rice and bean... Rad the rice and the bean, man, I think there are a lot of people who are not interested, who don't have appreciation for the kitchen, who must think that cooking is a bean.
Let's be frozen for the rest of the week.
Sundaying with a street, fresh who you do in 20 to 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, in half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
Spering or delivering of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: men, women.
boy, girl, child, adult, and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, by changing education, we teach children, taking their children to fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think that it comes from the supermarket shelves, so we're from good children.
independent growth of the food industry, because they'll be much less sick, growing with fear of a wedding food, a healthy food, I believe we have to change.
The food dynamic, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to license, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Right?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
There are fewer hospitals, this is education, education, prevention, so?
The future of food.
And it will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better.
(Applause) Thank you.
Life is not here for us to live.
AC: But that's the one we go.
And how does it wake up to the rope?
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family is to be here, I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to the family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world by chance.
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are, and by containing them, we also transform ourselves, before looking at this future, we need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "discamids," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened, this book helped me to live the mourning, so I had used it and told this story brings one of the most beautiful things about it.
That is the power that people can, when they feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because, obviously, someone will come and sit on the lap of this story and feel welcomed.
(Laughter) But then, one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
(Laughter) Of products, I understood at 45 years that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I began to help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had already been very small to me.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx about purposeful entrepreneurship, something so fashionable nowadays, but he brought me another challenge.
That was talking about bullying, because that's what he'd always suffered, and he wanted to share the story with others, but I had water.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of disguise and always had a lot of complaint with the right.
Above all that they had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can take who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who was understanding this, was changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about acceptance and family.
It was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, I've also seen that the roof they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat.
(Laughter) And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed, and just as he welcomed, I'll tell him a lot of people's story.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that didn't feel embarrassed, now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story to tell him that they had felt welcomed in his story, that wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
So, tell stories to me?
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we're ready to hear, we transform ourselves.
For me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about asking a question to the audience, telling something funny, showing your children's photo, but, in fact, I think this isn't the most important thing, and if there's no formula, there's a big rule for me.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, ávio, the professor of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we spent months preparing his speech at the Açador's TEDx.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what is wrong with it."
Every time you tell me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to get out of here, you have to be your heart, and it has changed everything.
He came at the day, and he gave an incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how it was the fact that he had been listened to when he needed it, when he thought about "suicide" when he had cancer.
What made him study about this, and it was him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, there are so many dictionary and writing courses, but who's worried about learning how to listen?
We transform ourselves and we saw this today, that the more we really hear, because he tells me, and we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we're going to change, let's change, so we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and how knowledge we always get there and say.
I won't even listen to ourselves and to others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to come to embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time for people.
Because we're worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
AC: This, after hearing his talk, got back.
The other Tedé.
AC: But.
(Laughter) And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various I heard.
It holds out all the others.
We say, on the street, many of us that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, we have, at least, a smile, and it doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here to me, it was outside my trip.
I suffered a lot to be here today, teaching something, caring, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people, and the answer to me ... and to everyone ...
I saw from a poem I even wrote, and now you apologize me, but I'm going to read, I want to free many of the people I know, to give them the key of their lives, to give them faith in life.
The right to love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change faith in some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to free fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, it's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and step, or you'll say there are judgments.
There is no lake of Homagra, beautiful, rich and poor, where there are all sorts of stars and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they are only belonging to their plural spaces, but they are only legacted to their existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed about my life.
A phase in which the right of only being was denied, therefore resisting and existing has always been a condition for me.
From the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
A woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her when she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
That's exactly why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky, the universe was infinite, no bright or the beauty of the other.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and definitely understand that the different one agrees?
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
And this is rich, this exchange, so I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to learn something different from us. We learn new stories, new narratives, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from you, allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in that process the bathroom, for me, was a doll ball, where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, or where I questioned God, the why I was different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied to me?
Or better, why did I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom and answer is simple: the fact that I'm different.
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad, and why?
I didn't even know what trans people were, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitating, and that desire to grow up inside me, I said, "Guys, I want to turn transsexual too, like this, everyone coming, so she thought at the beginning of the wrong way."
I wanted to mirror myself in the other, so, during my graduation in Artescenica, I had the opportunity to meet myself, from inside to outside, the theater showed in the world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the the theater that I learned to understand the other, so I started to search for my true decency and I started to get down, it's as if you enter a coconut, stay a while there, and a beautiful eraster.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everybody is standing to deal with it, it's difficult when you're in the midst of a mixture of transformations.
And if you are a woman, black, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily.
In the case of us, trans, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, do you look after yourself, our new thing, don't you have traffic faces?"
I said, "No, this is easy, go to me."
AC: People.
Who are aware, chooses, who is the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's a magnifying glass here who wants to see this one.
While a white man has his life expectancy of 76.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
And I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women.
I said that today, trans women in Brazil, we have even 14 times the chance of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 people who were killed here in Brazil, in 2016, with 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
S: Being a trans is not an option, but, in a living condition, there's no magic formula, there's no one - I take a calder and a little force, resistance, 35-year expectation, there's no one who was yet like that, that we could better measure this panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, because each one of us is the protagonist of your own story, understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world, and only depends on us.
For example, I'm the living proof of this, after finally meeting myself who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish myself, I created in Cana Noutube, where, gradually, I became a reference to other people, not only transsexual people.
I was invited to live a trans character in an immensority that exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's a responsibility, bro!
(Applause) It's a great responsibility to talk about differences for so many people.
Representing a flag and being ugly to all that I represent alongside it.
That's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "They were filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, and there's no business.
The price is to receive message from other trans women's mothers, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes of brilliance.
And I thank you.
When you see me there and see me, there's no black guy.
To understand the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be just the strange.
It only transforms a technique in the part of what I am.
I'm far beyond that, I'm much beyond strange.
But to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference agrees.
The sky is the refuge of allies.
Who was me, one will be there.
And half you're wearing blue.
Liberity without limits: me and sky, sky and me.
I've already got away from my corridors, no longer looking, I don't need to stop, only what's left behind the psychiatry.
What mark my soul, but the future, what does the future promise?
That's what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I'm going to fly.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
And I spent many years doing this and following the children, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, we won't get a sixth grade."
(Laughter) Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been hospitalized, given point, nothing, and it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later at the ICU, in the same village I stayed with children with cancer.
(Laughter) Then I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
(Laughter) The belly, I called nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
(Laughter) Then I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's outside the visitor's time."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
Until I slept, I cut only after the room.
I used to travel with cancer, measures and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because after all, I'll do it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter) So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was safe in that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
which sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "c cancer"?
And I was stubborn.
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, piruque was for them, that it wasn't able to see me as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital, a blunt, I asked you, "No, now I've got you all the same, I've had cancer, the children said, "Wow, you laughed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer, don't take it."
But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a glass and a toothpaste brush, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
This for my information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through that, and what happened, the children started to give me their procedures."
So, they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We were playing, but we thought chemotherapy caused hair falls, but then you thought, "Oh, chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair fell." "Oh, but not only tumor cells doubles quickly, but also hair cells," they also understood, "Oh, it's working."
And he started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to add a catheter, if you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have both legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running," and I said, "There is a patient who will breastfeed a leg," "You can come here," and I said that the information is focused on the patient.
(Laughter) But the patient approached the patient's entrance in the middle, but at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love you with heart, you drawings, ventricular.
I think it's good, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide, this guide is to distribute for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year if there's a sponsor in the audience.
AC: For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and the guide is very asked in Northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate, that children will do.
(Laughter) With that, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
and do several other actions.
The information is very important, and sometimes information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, complex modernity, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent in a kit, so what we talk and we prepare.
That you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when you do events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done the treatment, he's with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, he's in spreading care, or there's no thing at the moment.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't exist.
And what happens with this and when you are the patient?
(Laughter) How many times I was in the hospital in the room, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of trouble at home, and then you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Will I get to this internship, I want to take me to the hospital to see what's a difficulty?"
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need help, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today, all I can do is information so we can save many others. Thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because the dependency here gives me a disease in a brain disease and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Laughter) What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer is inside us?
To treat chemical dependency, what if patients really are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought about various things, and one of these things is in our own organism: one of these defense is in our brain, it's called packaging packaging barrier, despite being a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and brain veins and that make bacteria that viruses and non-violent substances don't enter the brain, don't let us down.
Unfortunately, drugs manage to contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the sterfallic barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
AR: We also have another protection system which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrofogo cites it and neutralize it.
Well then.
Can we not join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are us?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs quantities, producing anticope against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
It's enough.
AC: You don't need more drugs in the system, you're overcrowded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system, a message of hope.
In other words, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-crophs are big molecules, and then that problem that the emerencephalic barrier had to let go straight away the drugs stop existing, because when the user ...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is connected to a large and pum molecule, it's no longer in the kitchen barrier, you speak.
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is.
Here, the right of you?
We have a while that hasn't received the vaccine: these white dots you can see is a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
In other words, when these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it pass freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Once we were able to imunize them, and you can see on the left side of you, there is a significant diminution of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that was passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, they're arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency, so what our group is working now is, in fact, to help people gain freedom, we believe.
Maybe, in some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time to decide a time to gain freedom again and ...
AG: Discuting with themselves, if they want to use drugs, thank you very much.
I'm being.
Not psychotherapy.
More than 40 years ago.
And I want to read and say that -
Besides.
VR: Daneroses.
Narrator: Malen?
Psychosis.
There is a terrible disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infelelelelelled, "Dad, go?
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I must say that...
Maybe these are one of the charming?
Great meeting of this TEDx.
In the Swiss.
It's here.
Our music is being.
It was stunned from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example, is an example perhaps.
The most deadly.
What is "aluar moça."
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important part of the norm is the context.
Sistenio.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
And it will not always exist.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times.
And I said, "What? What?"
And we live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, not of corruption predomina.
Dehumanity, in its word, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
Is it a worker?
It's been more than 30 years since.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is the absence of conflicts.
And I said, "No.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes a bit of payment.
What military for peace?
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Sintomas with you?
Sometimes even.
A despair, conscious, light.
Is it an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
Isabelo, when my daughter of a family shelter was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked me, "What is the princess you like most?"
Gataweira, Cinderela?
The fallen asleep?
She thought.
And he answered.
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
And I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling.
In your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
That the "normal" are not being.
People who looked for me?
With panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is the fear of the family system?
Is it the myth?
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
And forests?
And being deertified, these people would dismay.
My respect is the world.
People known as psychiatrists and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
System.
And sometimes it won't do it.
And how did I say it?
What's crazy?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And don't talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call ...
There were sequatic, saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I ...
I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here in Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
"What am I trying to do this?"
Why mormose?
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
That nothing against certainty?
At that moment, "Hi!
That you suffer a desire too.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo.
From racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
I said, "Well, love!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The girlfriend of another specialization, a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
No, no.
And the thorta sky catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mime, mimore, and it doesn't realize, its existence in the sense, we're going.
In an inexorable globalization, a person who is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It's a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
Apontating.
As it's a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The wish that brought us the incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
And we live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can tell it, if you didn't tell it to lose.
"So? What do you mean?
In the foundation of norms?
[A.DE.]
Or situations.
There's another one.
This is very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said or not.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird from a snake, from a face?
I ask a friend of Unippace.
Is it a Nobel Prize, alternative, and economy?
From the developing country, Mom was Max, Niffe, Chile.
When I met my dose, he told us that, since a child, he wanted to know where the human being was different from other species.
It's intelligence, no, it's language, no, it's culture, it's humor, no.
One day, while talking to his father, he was very respectful, his father said.
Isn't it my stupidity?
He heard a little light, and said he became the first stupid.
Comupidology is science that we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is it?
Audience: Yes.
That's absolutely...
Audience: Yes.
One day, I like to remember Rolentor, a creator of biodiction, a great brother, and he told us that it should be a hipotalic idiot, be a good animal, from holidays to the chest that will be Bral.
The question is stupidity because it relies on rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's high.
Rational.
To have qualified diplomas and universities.
And do it as a person who is talking about developing, with graphs, sophisticated tobels, like a person sitting on the branch of a tree, closing.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had it.
Two infinite things.
The universe in this human tank.
And he agreed: Einstein.
In relation to a universe, I still have.
But I need to say that I agree.
They are not pointing out the species's characteristics, yes, of the norm, considering that "diainist" and "nex nefing" feels, even respecting us and human beings.
Isn't it from nature?
We are born to be, to flourish stupidity, on the contrary, to serve.
So ...
I intend to think about comfort.
That 2600 years ago said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's completely, we are not born human.
And we make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen and go to the sea,
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas, or to be in Juras?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, about cultivating the dimensions of the soul of psyche, of developing emotional intelligence, which, since the 17th century, seems that it's only about developing a rational demonstration, not learning to read the book of the night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
Or 50?
And I knew what the precets of the sky were.
