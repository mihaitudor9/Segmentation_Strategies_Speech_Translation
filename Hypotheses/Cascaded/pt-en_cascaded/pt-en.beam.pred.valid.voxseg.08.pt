I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What was this saying?
That the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox.
And our children are what we have the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and yet.
Our children have been very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
What if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, who are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
And if they rebel, we ...
And we offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
I want us to go on a small trip about seven capital pecates that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll get through Gabriela's wave, a typical middle class child.
Let's start with her pregnancy to see these seas.
Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth, that moment of connection, of affection with her daughter, to receive with her husband, this baby who will be born.
She then starts to attend pre-natal, and quickly the hospital's medical industry, the convinced that I best for her is accessible, an ally lying argument, but it's very convincing, so convincing, that produces blinding culture, a culture that women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is inactive, for example, in Rio de Janeiro, 93% are made by cesarian.
According to 15 to 20% in the engaging countries, this generates huge benefits for children. This makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical act of a adopted woman.
Inmobilized, of course, it can be humanized, and it can be done well, but certainly it won't have the same benefits as normal impact.
And remembering that, of course, there are necessary cablets for each of these sines that we'll write.
And we are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working, will tell reality, "Here, you can take that a mammal is a formula like this, of milk in grandma, the case of her needs, it's hungry, it goes home safer, arrives home, her grandma, which business you, is alive, is outside.
The child is crying, the tolerator is dark, in two months this child is in a nursery, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a large part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: prize, ex-person.
Suprim, and breast milk is money, it's for, it's breastfeeding, but it just comes with a lot of love, and it's infinitely superior to any of these forms.
And more.
industries advertise directly to the doctor, they do their marriage doctor.
Convention of their nutritional and congressive qualities, and sponsoring entirely medical societies, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatrist, that end up unconsciously.
I'm one of the largest homes in Brazil, and in this way we're losing.
The privileges in my breastfeeding and searching through the first sin, which is the privation of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
And my Gabriela grows, her mother will finish license, she will have to go to the bucket, because vovement can't take care of it.
She'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, but to get home her parents are tired of tired in a long journey of work, in bottles, and they'll live very little with her daughter.
There's still work to do at home, on weekends, and they'll take babies, dumps to wash babies, because after all, no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what's most precious in childhood, unlikely to our children, we often regret their adolescence, and the child loses the relief to the most important people of their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of this terrible peculiar of childhood's personalization.
Gabriela's parents can't cook, don't have time.
And there's no money to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give frozen food, industrialized food, what supermarkets show their brilliant shelves.
And they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy.
Because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar excess.
Black people out there, lines inside, all the weapons that the industry, through food engineering, highly developed.
What does so that children can be completely addicted to industrialised food and in this way unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
This brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy because it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we are worldwide consumption champions.
This is the sin inxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and someone knows that highly negative of the involvements of a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
And, however, our urban life doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they get enlightened, and don't want everyone to flood.
So these children spend eight, guys, being a statistic.
Eight to ten hours connected with their devices today, once again, connecting with the wall to play, it's great, but not eight hours later, children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
We looked at Janela, and saw a landscape passing in the form of meditation. However, today, two babies and two tablets for each one, if we can't do anything in the car, even in moments, that exists, people.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child most needs that exists, this comes from there, but you can say, "Ip√≥rico," "Ipote."
(Laughter) That's the name, porn.
And this makes us confin our children, and prevent them from having moments of awareness, of void, of TED, the fundamental in childhood.
Because TED and void are bercers of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination, and we are amputing this from our children with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
Gabriela watches four hours of TV per day, she is massacrated by advertising.
She's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because in school it's at maximum four hours, and she spend more time on American TV, and it's in recording, where we have less time in school.
And then, on the weekends, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the store.
The family does the classical show of the Brazilian family today, which is "U."
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, by consumerism values, and this advertising is a cubed obesity, it is an obesity that explodes in its capacity, to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
What explodes her love by characters, doing what she ...
They fall in love with toxic products, for expensive toys and brands, for inclusion of love.
And that instills values as an obsessive consumption.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
And in obesity, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that beer in Brazil is not welcomed, not people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind it, it's obviously the ones who need friendship are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by child consumerism.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who has no meditated in the balance, look at the sky, look at the ground."
There's no better meditation than that.
Ronga is more money in a class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization, that our society proposes, "Merodization, who uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell products?
It's fashion, in generalization, which is based on machismo, on the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the disociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating eroodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we're eight, ten years old, this peculiar of the ending in childhood and eroticization to which?
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put in a tribe, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she's going bad at school, the guilt of the school, we have to talk to a teacher.
She earns many gifts, when she needed, you see the present.
And she realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have the authority, a child, sometimes, when she's two or three years old, who realizes that her parents don't have the authority, she's half bad, she's insecure, she needs people who lead her life.
This generates anxiety and generates symptoms, and we know that the importance of limits of not fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability, instead, we're doing what the Americans call "relecopterprinting."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world.
They don't have life experience, so they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, that surely the world will give them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the superpower in childhood: OK, in front of so many problems, of course, childhood will give five pills, the child will be rebelled, "bigone," "birty," and will get sick, eat too much, it'll be obese, it'll be ill in school, it won't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it.
And it's not possible for these children in this way.
The same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What's the solution we're not going to give to evilted children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, it's called "medicalization and the worst iny."
The quino de Mafalda says this: "Rettable is a wonderful way, of how many stories of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people passing bad because of the paper.
And they go to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy.
And what doesn't show us here, in fact, what the factory is producing exactly the medicine, right?
And that's what we're doing with our children, not only with educational children, adults also, in a way, are embarrassed.
Medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are so black, with this individualistic competitive society, right?
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, just like medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and imperativity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood, we're rooting, norming and preventing children to be themselves, and I'm sure some of these geniuses, in humanity, had today in school.
It would be exactly this: rooted or not martized, and we would have sympathetic his genius and we would have lost that wonderful thing we had of bringing.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths, and problems are very complex, I don't see, without end of sines and factors that feed each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there's always a simple solution.
It's easy and invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
That's what we think about it.
The solution is a very old TEDx; I'm already going through, and I'll spend my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do, when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today means "desthetic treatment," in almost all churches, the "d√©cima" is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, which is our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays?
Our most important capital is time.
The time?
We have 17 hours of surveillance.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not too much, it's possible, it's just prioritizing, and if it doesn't happen in the weekends, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to live together.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds.
And you'll close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow, because they have health, quality of life, a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
JP: No?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
And this demonstrates a little the importance of nature between us, and nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul, we know what makes us healthy, not a doctor, hospital, medicine, these factors are all of us, we know this.
What we don't know, and had an interesting experience.
I started with Patricia, who back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible?"
I talked about convergence, health and sustainability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment, everything that does well the environment and vice versa: riding a bike, the body good, my cities, pollution, collective transport is good for the land, see the animals.
Things always go around in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce consumption of excessive material, he'll promote the book which, at the same time, will generate intelligence, humour, imagination, creativity.
And it will generate living between families, loving life, IVGE was to live among children, different children, who will learn to know each other and learn to deal with them, we will develop empathy, promote contact with the air, only and the green that makes good physical being, being psychic, mental, and it will reduce all childhood's problems.
It reduces obesity, aggressiveness, Legia, even, improves immunity, improves socialization and schooling, and it's wonderful to bring children to nature, and, when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about throwing the wall and the city, embracing cities and playing in squares.
Soccupying public spaces, games, love, affection, and involvement, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly that.
And not only the initiative to use physics, she saw reinvending that's why public policies facilitate us with public space, with nature.
They don't wait, promote the cycle.
And free events, these steps: neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Impossible forces are very careful.
All of this, in fact, is called occupation of a city, is the word "copaque," which is practically used for resistance and citizens today. This means occupying public space with joy, and, mainly, taking part in the governance of the cities, and cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas related to public interest, sustainability, and equity.
And with transparency and paying bills.
There are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this: to finish the same scientists, which announce a terrible and environmental crisis that's coming here, it's going to come very early; our children will pick me up, and they also say, in 97% of social consensus, and it can become environmental, of course, doing everything we already know, working to do this.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to the relief, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold cachorr, not seeing YouTube, we learn more about this boxwel and defend them in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children already outside.
The family, already outside, we go to the city, we're going to occupy public spaces with the game, with play.
With entertainment, with part of this patient.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing the gallery side phase that left us ...
Unfortunately, this year?
He said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he goes away, if he approaches me a thousand steps, he pushes one thousand steps.
So, what does utopia serve exactly to not make us walk?
What does it make us walk outside.
AC: In 2007.
And I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disabilities, excluded from regular school.
And since then?
What's my biggest challenge?
It was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Caf√© terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
AC: To be able to discuss inclusion within school.
With their parents.
With their children and partners.
People with disabilities are very affected by whom they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
Pommunity.
It's for society in general.
People with disabilities -
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
(Laughter) Stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
VR: To have friendship.
to interact with people.
What's the case of student Igor, for example?
And what did he study at the other school?
AC: For four years he didn't go into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't have the strength either.
So, for four years, he stayed in the court.
Participating in all physical education lessons.
As he loved running, he ran all the time.
AC: Cheging isn't a clean field.
I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
What for him to do?
They improved the best learning.
The school?
It was a place for me.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
And today he's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
A healing.
The learning process itself.
The schools think.
They are not able to treat these students.
And that they are not prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
He needed to use it.
And I believed.
AC: And they are capable.
(Laughter) And what do these quitments inside the school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do well to other students.
For the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned.
To see the possibilities.
From the learning of others.
Why is school like this?
There's what I know.
There's what you know and what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view.
AC: To survive with people.
So, they can see it.
And I learn.
You can know.
My hearing?
AC: I live with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs.
With those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
AC: With those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
And what's most important that I learned?
It was valued my heart.
And the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
AC: It's learning the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother, cooking, right?
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Pa√°scoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
I'd like to put my hand on the shoes with her. Actually, it was my brother, so much so that today she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen, and that's the answer?"
That I want to give you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking.
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world.
It changed my diet and, with it, I started to realize that food had power, let's say.
I also decided to study food philosophies that could use food as a prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a medicine month.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system.
Through food.
(Applause)
I believe that...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
The detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Truc√© is a little of life.
It's rural for the city, we can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's able to reestructure the food system, change the dynamic of food.
The production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example.
There are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed.
The more you produce, the cheaper you produce.
Worst is quality.
And the greater the cost of the environment and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, it's artificially accelerated and it starts to grow and produce in a way that their bodies...
"Yes ...
I arrive an hour that is not delayed.
And he begins to lose, decrease drastically.
Your quality of life, your health and your life time.
So, I believe we can and must change this food system because, as it may cost so little, you can create an animal from birth to abate, this didn't enter my head.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process on the industrial scale is also a lot.
Let's say this harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, nowadays, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agro toxic products per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society ...
It has the values.
Invertising: there is an investment of values, why does a person worry about not buying a falsified perfume because they think they'll have an alertical reaction because they don't know the origin, they don't know what chemistry there is inside it?
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover this change of values, and we need to teach people.
"Ah! I don't know
to appreciate organic products because the more you buy, for example, a pack of lettuces.
It's not an organic interface, you're paying, not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that behind that leface, there's someone who cared for all affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
(Applause) In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food, a third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
And in terms of consumption, the way we consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in S√£o Paulo.
What if I took her, put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue?
I'm sure it's to be very scared, seeing those executives, or those appreciated people, walking down the street, speaking on the cell phone, swallowing a pizza piece, for example, but actually.
It's very important, so she'd have almost a fivepe, but because it doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding yourself.
And it's ...
And then?
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for that, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we end up opening space to the street, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of Salvador and sugar which are the three, is trufficious, right?
And these, mainly, wisdom farmers end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a physiological dependency, that is, industrialized products in excess is very harmful, and they end up creating a physical dependence, but also a mental dependence, a psychological dependency, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorn, that little panel in the place of microwaves, look?
Made, half.
And who's still a cake, instead of buying that little bag ready, of a package?
Hi, too, half a half.
This question may seem like these two questions, may seem a little harmless, not to say anything, but in fact, it means a lot, only if you can exchange the panel's popcorn from a excessive packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of producing industrialized is a lot.
Initial preference.
So, let's talk ...
Is it to summarize?
This question of the production process of food, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not easy, it's not working, and we have to change, but how to change?
Right?
The main answer is returning to fire.
Think about it.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
cooking brings independence, brings self-awareness, brings autonomy, brings freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry.
It's because they don't cook, it simply showed food processes, so if you let the industry feed you?
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Lasanha, frozen, frozen battle, hamburger, blind dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we are ...
Where is the rice and the bean? No, man, then... Where is the bean rice cada day?
That filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think that making very hard food, very anti-personatic, is waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean, the night to day, the morning cord, and in 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel.
Let's be frozen for the rest of the week.
Sunding with a street, fresh who you do in 20 to 30 minutes.
More the vegetables you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
To wait or twice as Pizza.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
boy, girl, child, adult, and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education, we teach children, taking the fair to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner.
It's putting children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can...
It's to build a better future, these children will grow.
With a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think it's from the supermarket shelter, right?
We are good children.
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutical industry, because they will get less sick, growing up eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
And I believe we have to ...
And changing?
The food dynamic, we have to change our ais.
Our value we have with food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating more.
And cooking, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to license, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Right?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
There are fewer hospitals, this is education, education, prevention, so?
The future of food.
And it will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
Life is not here for us to live.
AC: But that's the one we go.
And how is the rope for color?
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I'd come back as a child.
Fairy goes by, my cousins, my brothers, and also for family parties.
My grandfather, Mario G√ºeyus?
It was the first planter of recycling mechanisms from Brazil, here in the land of Buti√°.
For me, and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother and had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five brothers.
(Laughter) I arrived in this world.
By the way,
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are, and by containing them, we also transform ourselves, before looking at this future, we need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "discamids," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened, this book helped me live the mourning.
I know that he helped a lot of people too, so to have told this story.
For me, it brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
That is the power that people can, when they feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because obviously someone goes.
She sees and will sit on her face and feel welcomed.
(Laughter) But then, one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
I, about products, understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I passed ... Oh!
Help people to tell their stories, because the publicity world had been very small for me.
(Laughter) So I started to do this, "What about one of them?
Stories that I want to share with you are Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk about two years ago at TEDx.
entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable nowadays, but he brought me another challenge.
That was talking about bullying, because that's what he've always suffered.
And he wanted to share the story with others.
And I left because I had to do with the subject, but I had water.
While we were preparing to talk about it?
He always came with a lot of badness, and always a lot of complaints, a right.
Above all that had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, to be to continue complaining about who did that with us, and, otherwise, to inspire people?
AG: They can welcome themselves and take responsibility of who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who understood this, started changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
And I like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
And also to have seen that the roof they imagined Tiago had.
It was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell him a lot of people's story.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
Now imagine if Tiago didn't have contact with his story, who wanted to share with him the problems that were going through his families, to tell him that they felt welcomed in his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that I didn't have any shame.
So, tell stories to me.
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we're ready to hear, we transform ourselves.
For me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about asking a question to the audience, telling something funny, showing your children's photo, but, in fact, I think this isn't the most important thing, and if there's no formula, there's a big rule for me.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not by the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, √°vio, the professor of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we stayed for months.
Preparing his talk at TEDx Lossadores.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong."
Every time you tell me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to get out of here, you have to be your heart, and it has changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk about listening.
AC: About the importance of listening to each other and how it was the fact that he had been heard when he needed it most, when people suicide when he had cancer.
What did he do?
Audience: Yes.
I went to study about this, and it was him who taught me that we are always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, there are so many dictionary, oratory courses, but who are worried about learning how to listen.
And we saw this today, that the more we truly hear, we transform ourselves, because he tells me, and we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we're going to change, let's change, so we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and how knowledge we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
For us and for others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
But we don't have one minute to look at each other, to come embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time for people.
Because we're worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
AC: This, after hearing his talk, got back.
The other Ted√©.
AC: But.
Audience: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various I heard.
It holds out all the others.
(Laughter) That empathy too, I learned collectivity, on the street, many of us say, on the street, that we have nothing to give, when they ask for something, we have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and we tell, that make us who we are, and when we listen to others in real life.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here to me, it was outside my trip.
I suffered a lot to be here today, teaching something, caring, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people, and the answer to me ... and to everyone ...
I saw from a poem I even wrote, and now you apologize me, but I'm going to read, I'd like to liberate many of the people I know, to return to her the key of her life.
From the room of the flaws, the salts of values, the kitchen of uncertainty, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to give them faith in life.
Faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know.
Saying that they have the right to change the right to cry, the right to love, of not loving between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day, I wanted to free many people that I know, to free their history, that, despite being important, it is not determining.
PC: Really released.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
AC: And you, what stories will you tell about your life?
Stories, you want you to talk about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces.
It's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and step, or you may say there are judgments.
Where there are all types of stars and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they are only part of their plural spaces.
There's no fat formula or thin, pretty ugly, rich and poor.
It's only legacy to their existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while.
During a very obscure phase that reflected on my life.
A phase where I was denied the right of being, therefore, to resist and to exist, was always a condition of life.
From the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
A woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her when she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect.
And the right for life.
That's exactly why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky, the universe was infinite, no bright or the beauty of the other.
So why are we here below?
So, as a child, we couldn't reproduce something so simple: acceptance, empathy.
And to definitely understand that the different one agrees.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
So that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
The different thing is beauty.
It's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives.
And this is rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a golden ball.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied to me?
The best thing is why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple: the fact that I am different.
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it's about the trans universe, this even more difficult path, I researched on the Internet, but let's see people like me, and during my 21st years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitating, and that desire to grow inside me, I said, "Guys, I want to become transsexual too, like this, everyone is turning."
And, for then, she thought at the beginning of the wrong way.
I wanted to mirror myself to the other, so, during my graduation in Artescenica, I had the opportunity to meet myself from inside.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand others, so I started to look for my true essence and I started to disappoint myself.
It's as if you enter a cockle, stay a while there, that's a beautiful ballot.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everybody is standing to deal with it, it's difficult when you're in the midst of a mixture of transformations.
And you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world.
And if you are a woman, black, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily.
In the case of us, trans, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, do you look after yourself, our new thing, don't you have traffic faces?"
I said, "No.
You're a phase, go for me."
AC: People.
Who are aware, chooses, who is the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's a magnifying glass here who wants to see this one.
While a white man has his life expectancy of 76.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills trans people?
And in the whole world.
And I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women.
I said that today, trans women in Brazil, we have 14 times a chance.
To die of being murdered, more than a gay male.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016.
Thanks, 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
And being a trans, it's not good.
"No.
But, in a conditions of life, there's no magic formula, there's no one - I take a little butder and a little force, resistance, 35-year expectation - there's no one who was still like this - that we could measure the best this panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story.
However, in each one of us is the protagonist of their own story, understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
It only depends on us.
For example, I'm the living proof of this, after finally meeting myself who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my art as a way of deconstruction of ideas to establish myself, I created in Cana on YouTube, where, gradually, I became a reference to other people, not only transsexual people.
I saw myself lecturing about a life experience for many people, I saw myself being a model, magazine layer, J, and "perform" and "outuber," and there's no point in having my career.
I was invited to live a trans character in an immensority that exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's a responsibility, bro!
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences.
For so many people!
To represent a flag.
And you went to all that I represent with her.
That's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
Even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, talk about it.
who were filled with comments, "How a man who can, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What doesn't have a company?
The price is to receive message from other trans women's mothers, thank me.
To laugh, to teach her.
More than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes of brilliance.
And I thank you.
For you to see me there and see, "This has no prize."
Understanding the difference is someone who can definitely change a world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be just the strange.
It only transforms a technique in part of what I do.
I'm far beyond that, I'm much beyond strange.
But to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference agrees.
The sky?
It's the refuge of allies.
Who was I?
One will be there.
And half you're wearing blue.
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
I can't stop, I don't look anymore, I've gotten away from my courant.
In the past, only what's left are the scars.
What a marvelous!
EV: But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being beside me, now I am, now I'm going, I'll fly.
Very well.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
I spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I couldn't often explain to the children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures, that doctors called "teratoma."
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get out of tumors, you won't take a sixth grade."
Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been hospitalized, given point, nothing, and it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later at the ICU, in the same village I stayed with children with cancer.
(Laughter) Then I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
(Laughter) The belly, I called nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
So I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's outside the visitor's pain."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
Audience: Yes.
I took a while later in the room.
I used to travel with cancer, measures and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because, after all, I'll do it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter) So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was safe in that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
which sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "canscer."
And I was stubborn.
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threatened, but my friends were donating to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, piruque was for them, that it wasn't able to see me as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital,
The children said, "Wow, you've sewed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
I told you, "OK, what she doesn't take, OK, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures: when I went to put the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, I first did it on a vacuum, I received a hospital kit, which, in that kit, came a sabone.
A base has a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
This for my information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through that, and what happened, the children started to give me their procedures."
So, they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
Things we were playing, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused a lot of hair fall, because it killed cells that doubled rapidly, but not only the tumor cells doubled rapidly, but also the hair cells, they could still say, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to add a catheter, if you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running," and I said, "There is a patient who will breastfeed a leg," "You can come here," and I said, "Oh, not with advertising," and the doctors, but you say that information is focused on the patient."
But the patient finally approached the patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process.
We decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love you with the heart, you drawings, ventricular.
I think no, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide, this guide is to distribute for children in treatment.
Unfortunately, we can only do about 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
What if there's a sponsor in the audience?
AC: For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zel√¢ndia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and the guide is very asked in Northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate, that children will do.
With that, we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
and do several other actions.
The information is very important, and sometimes information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit ... So, what do we say and do we play?
That you need to have information about everything.
For example, I don't know if you know more about it, when we do events, carecas children earn much more present and pay attention to what hueludous children, but sometimes a cared child has already done the treatment, there's no cancer, sometimes a child who has cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, there's no spreading care, or there's no thing at the moment.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't have.
And what happens with this and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home, and then you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Will I get to this internship, I want to take me to the hospital to see what's a difficult time?"
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there was a child with an adult who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see and with my life is good, and when we need help, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital.
To help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
AC: In my PPA career.
As a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because the dependence here gives me a disease and a brain disease.
And a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
I said, "But...
What if, in fact, what if the answer really has inside us?
To treat chemical dependency, what if patients really are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of those defense is in our brain, it's called "fold in a mistake."
The matocefal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain, and that make bacteria and non-violent substances enter our brain and don't do bad in our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the pack of serphaly, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
AR: We also have another protection system which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed of jungles, anticorpos and various chemical strategies.
That act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrophogo in the blood race, running after a bacterium, until it can absorb it and neutralize it.
Well then.
Can we not join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are us?
A few years ago?
We started discussing these issues until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities.
They realized that those people who used more drugs produced anticope against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
"Of course!"
It's enough!
AC: You don't need more drugs in the system, you're overcrowded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
AR: We've been researching for some years.
In the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two.
What is it capable of sending this message to our immune system?
It's a message waiting.
I mean.
An immune system, produces anticorposes against drugs, and we'll try to help this person to gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-crophs are big molecules, and then that problem that the barrier emerves to pass freely drugs stop existing, because when the user ...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is connected to a large and pum molecule, it's no longer in the kitchen barrier, you speak.
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is.
Here, the right of you?
We have a while that hasn't received the vaccine, these white dots you can see, it's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Once we were able to imunize them, and you can see them on the left side.
AC: There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was stopped, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater radiation concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocking the passion of these radiation molecules, they hadn't been blood.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they get stuck inside the box or more inhibited that don't happen with the rats that receive cocaine, then what our group is working.
What this treatment is, the therapeutic vaccine or the antidrogen vaccine, can be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependence.
Maybe some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide.
AC: A time to gain freedom again and ...
To discuss with themselves, if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much.
I'm being.
In psychotherapy.
More than 40 years ago.
And I want to tell you that...
Besides?

Psychosis.
There is a terrible disease.
In fact.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infelelelelelated, "Pry, go?
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I must say that...
Maybe these are one of the charming.
Great meeting of this TEDx.
In the Swiss.
It's here.
No, music is being.
Toting from the beginning.
What is the norm?
They are habits, attitudes.
It's a set of behavior.
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example, is an example perhaps.
The most deadly.
What is "aluar mo√ßa."
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
The norm is the location.
Sistenio.
The other is evolution.
Tinco.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
And it will not always exist.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times?
And I said, "What? What?"
And we live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It doesn't predict corruption.
Dehumanity, in its word, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
Is it a worker?
It's been more than 30 years since.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is the absence of conflicts.
And I said, "No.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes ...
For a little payment.
What military for peace?
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person should, that one ...
What has the ability to present yourself in tomatoes.
Sintomas with you?
Sometimes even.
A despair, conscious, light.
Is it an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
from a family shell.
And I said, "When is my daughter?"
Isabela.
I was five years old.
And today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked her.
What princess do you like most?
Gataweira, Cinderela?
The fallen asleep?
She thought.
And he answered.
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
And I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling.
In your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
And the norms don't have to be.
People who looked for me?
With panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
What a capture!
It had open doors of awareness.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
Is it fear?
of humanity, in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
And forests.
Being deertified, these people have passed away.
My respect is the world.
Dominated people.
Psychiatrics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy are also considered serious.
Simple.
Because they are like a rule that captures the contradictions.
Cultural?
System.
And sometimes it won't do it.
And how did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And don't talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent.
What we call this.
OK?
Psychiatrics are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an ins√¥nia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I ...
I think.
In an occasion I came to give a seminary here, from Porto Alegre.
NJ: Yes.
The taxist, knowing I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
And he's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
"What am I trying to do this?"
He went back to lunch.
"So? What do you mean?
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all of them.
The idea is to adjust.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
That nothing against certainty?
At that moment, "Hi!
who suffered a distress.
So ...
And did you say that?
It's from norms, machismo.
From racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
"Well, love!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The girlfriend of another specialization, a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
And the thorta sky catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mime and doesn't realize its existence in the sense.
We showed the indexes.
In an inexorable globalization, a person who is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It's a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
Apontate it.
As it's a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The wish that brought us the incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can tell it, if you didn't tell it to lose.
"So? What do you mean?
In the foundation of norms?
[A.DE.]
Or situations.
There's another one.
This is very important.
It's the evolutionary, it's also been said.
JJP: Great.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird from a snake, from a box?
I think of a friend of Unippace.
Is it a Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
Mom's developing country was Max, Nife, Chile.
When I met my teenage girl, he told us that, since the boy, he wanted to know where the human being was interested.
And the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
No, it's language, no, it's culture, it's humor, no.
One day, while talking to his father, he was very respectful, his father said.
Isn't it my stupidity?
He heard a little light, and said he became the first stupid.
Comupidology is science that we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is it?
Audience: Yes.
That's absolutely...
And at Denoa, I like to remember Rulenturo.
And she told us, "It's necessary!
(Laughter) If a hipotanic stupid, be a good animal, do holiday to the chest Bral?
The question is stupidity because it relies on rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and she can also be.
Rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Colificate.
And to do it as a person who is talking about sophisticated development, with graphs, like a person sitting down.
In the branch of a tree, sweat.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had it.
Two infinite things.
The universe is human stubbornness.
And he agreed: Einstein.
In relation to a universe, I still have.
But I need to say that I agree.
Diainist and Max nephing, although respecting us and considering what?
They are pointing out not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the norm.
It's the human being.
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
To serve?
So ...
I prefer to think.
Let's not confuse it.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's in complicity.
I said, "No.
We are humans.
And we make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen it, and goes to the sea,
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or air?
I said, "There's help.
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, it's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist, developing emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart.
To learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 5?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Obceived?
I'd hear the invitation of oil.
At 70.
I could follow the instructions of my own heart because what I wanted to not anymore, the borders of justice anymore.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
They told us, 2,000 years ago, you exchange clothes in 5 million, it takes to be an entire existence to exchange.
After all.
And this is the task.
And in this sense?
The norm refers to an evolutionary establishment.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: wake up?
21st century.
The third world.
And no less than this sees this swarm.
In the future.
The new ones.
Geras.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
David didn't understand the human evolution, he was naturalist, he understood the natural evolution of human beings, but the human being, as Tia Chartan said, is space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to orch, to serve.
Did someone ask?
Thank you.
Tell God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
Potentially.
I am.
"So? What do you mean?
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we hear doesn't happen to you.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once.
What?
A forest.
Not to give up.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flow!
who picked up a source, an water drop and played in the middle of the fire and returned, resiliently, another drop.
He would play me in the middle of fire, and return with patience.
Ladies ... there.
What a little girl!
I was in the middle of the man, "A Tartufo Jo√£o, seeing that," said more, "Stay flower?
Do you think that with these bottle ridicles you'll erase this infernal fire?
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
A carpet friend.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little.
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions...
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
You want to breathe, a concept, right?
I do it with others, with others.
Comundo and comestive.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
We studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a giant narrative.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he is part of him.
And that is what we can do.
We can stand up.
And we can do our part, in fact.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each one talking about their own drop had given.
And all of us who are necessary?
"Yes."
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, there's your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle.
Once again, it's complaining.
Sorry.
So, what?
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewing.
I love it.
Our family.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Cecillia.
Let's see.
Renova.
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
They close the eyes they had seen.
And many others.
For other visions.
White professions?
What is this remote?
To be forgotten.
Sorry.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
More simple.
That's it.
Always far.
And inside.
That's it.
I entered a good school.
Don't worry.
Tiriboas, no.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a billboard, since my first one has a income.
I chose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
She had some multinational name recognized by her family.
It's three months.
She works 12 hours per kidney, high up to her strength's limit.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
Do interactive meetings, video games that won't take to any place, show that you're important for the structure.
More than working, it's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
I have a six likes point.
(Laughter) I found someone named, girlfriend, wedding.
He said, "I'm a speaker."
Scale the corporate pyramid.
He sees the shirt.
(Laughter)
The job exchange.
Be a manager.
The firm's car.
What does Freud and happy mean?
Happiness of time marked?
We'll have bad cuts and sapatoes.
Take the shirt.
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son is to hear each other.
(Laughter) Trop your car year, no year.
She bought an apartment and holds 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
Disney?
Two years later, all seven days per Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami.
More meetings that don't take somewhere, completely unqualified people, being promoted before you.
The project that started and improved as their desires.
It's a continuous feeling of changing the tea, the void that the passes in the mall on weekends can no longer applaud.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken, seen the shirt.
The baby is socially up every day.
The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle school crisis, the meeting with my college colleagues, my God, as the years went fast, is, life is short.
My children in school, my God, as they grown fast, is the hidden life.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we are going to sell the beach apartment, children grew up and don't even want to go further, to see the shirt.
The external collection is a little high, its body flattered, like an astronaut that spent years fighting in zero gravity.
(Laughter) No face and because of the healthy habit of going through dental thread, I place all infections.
Lut it rain, cold lactose, green juice.
(Laughter) A semestal Plan of the academy you used for two months, today it's a fourth day of bean, liver hamburgers, after staying late, in the sign, to close a project, because life is too short to eat easy.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing jobs, today, don't appreciate any more experience.
The fear of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
(Laughter) continuous feeling that prevents you from living, fear of death, a beautiful feeling of suffocation, "Where is the air, otherwise I'm focused?"
The complete disconnection with its children decorating from the 12 hours of work for decades.
The empty retirement, surrounded by useless things and not by faith.
AC: You're a winner, this is your only tip.
His life as an executive executive.
He sees the shirt, in wood.
Thank you very much.
