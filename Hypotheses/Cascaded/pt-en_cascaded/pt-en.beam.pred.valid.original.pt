I want to start with Nelson Mandela, in the great heroes of our time, that said, "The true character of a society is revealed by the way I portray their children."
But in Brazil we're living a paradox.
Our children are what we have of more precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give them our lives for them, and, however, our children come from very mistreated to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to make changes.
I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which are most of them according to Mandela's critics, we're a terrible character, because we deny them of basic rights, such as health, housing, education, and food.
We treat violence, and if they rebel, we offer them prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here, things won't happen either.
We make, maybe, not more sincere crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
We'll get the wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child, starting with her pregnancy, to understand these males.
Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth, here is the moment of link, of affection with her daughter, to receive with her husband, this baby who will be born.
She then starts to attend Planatal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces the necessary culture.
A culture that causes women to believe that normal birth must be accessible, which is normal birth, harmful, dangerous, painful, and that generates shameful statistics in our country, 93% are made by C-section, against 15 to 20% of the countries involved.
This generates huge benefits for children. This makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical acute to a adopted and immobilized woman.
Of course, it can be humanized and be done well, but certainly it won't have the same benefits as normal impact.
Remember that, of course, there are necessary cesáreas.
For each of these pecates that we'll write, we're criticizing is exaggeration, something unnecessary, what is lying.
The same way happens with a breast milk.
This woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I've already left the maternity hospital, one of the many pediatrists who can be there, working, will say to the age here, you can take a mammal here, a tiny milk formula to her case, precise, even hunger.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother goes home and says, "You've grown up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, strong?"
The child is crying, all of this is weak.
In two months this child is breastfeding, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer.
This comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: premise, experimented, supreme!
The maternal milk is money, it's entered, it's breastfeeding.
But he, precisely, comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, making a doctor their marriage, convinced of their nutritional and congressive qualities, sponsoring entirely the medical societies, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatric, that end up unconsciously being one of the biggest causes of basic resource.
In this way, we are losing the privileges of breastfeeding and seeking, through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that, by the way, reflect in adult life, that science is discovering now.
My Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the permit, she'll have to go, she grows, because vovão cannot take care of it, and she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution.
But when we get home, these parents are tired of tired of tired tires of long work, of helplessments, and they will live very little with their daughter.
There's still work to do at home."
At the weekend, they'll walk and take BAP to Harvard University, because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens?
If we lose what is most precious in childhood, convince our children.
We regret ourselves so much, we build adolescence.
And the child loses his contact with the most important people in his life.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with that person.
These are our precious children, and we are losing this because of an exterrible peculiar of the thirdization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay a maid, they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar, crocantes abroad, all the weapons that the media tells us, frozen food, industrialized food, and in this unequity of healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
And this brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploded in childhood.
And even if we want to provide food, and that we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy because it's given agrotoxis data, we're world champions of agrotox consumption.
This is the sin inxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and somebody knows that highly negative moments of a child.
It has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run around, go out, and yet, in our urban lives, they don't allow it to do this.
People are afraid to let the child leave, they stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, get crazy, and don't want everyone to get involved.
So these children spend eight, statistical people, eight to ten hours connected with their devices today.
Again, connecting with the play device is great, but not eight hours later.
Children have no right to a moment of awareness, they are permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
I remember when I traveled the car with my children, we played, it was an incredible moment.
And we cared a child, it's a wonderful thing: we played "Dedanha."
Who did DDH player?
Then, I chose the trouble, we played, played, played the people, they were moments of family relief from a laughing humor, of things that stay in our memory of us in childhood.
We looked at the window, we saw the landscape passing, in meditation form, but today it's two babies and two tables for each one, if it can't give anything in the car.
Even in moments, that exists, guys.
(Laughter) Even in moments, when the child needs more awareness.
This exists, this comes from there, but you can do it.
Impinic, the hypothesis.
(Laughter) That's the name, you can.
It still comes with a layer to cover the successful tablet on a bus look, right?
Even in moments when she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer to her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction.
So this makes us confin our children and prevent them from having moments of awareness, of void, of TED, fundamental in childhood, because TED and void are bounds of what is most important to us, creativity and imagination.
And we are breastfeeding this from our children with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
Gabriela watched four hours of TV per day.
It's massacrated by advertising.
She's more educated by advertisers than by teachers because in school, she spend four hours as much and spend more time on television.
Americans were in records and we sometimes work because we have less time at school.
And then, on the weekends, of course, she goes to the park.
No, you don't go to Parquinho.
The family does the classical show of the Brazilian family today in week, which is the ...
Very well.
Well, it's going to do something.
To have more massacrated by advertising, for consumer values.
And this advertising is a speed curved.
The mobility that explodes in her ability to distinguish reality fantasy, that explodes her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, cars and brands, according to love, and that will disagree with obesity, will disagree, even in the consumption of glasses.
We know that beer in Brazil is not waterproof.
The advertisement is totally liberated and always confused from the friendship behind, it's obviously the one who most needs friendship is the teenagers, and they are deeply affected by beer commercial, and welcoming, adolescence, is growing scary.
This is the sin in childhood mercantilization and child consumism.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of commitments.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
(Laughter) But she could meditate in the little square, people in the balance the marvelous language, "Who hasn't shut me up at the ball?"
Look at the sky, look at the floor, look at the sky ... (Laughter) There's no better meditation than that!
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: merosization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, to the excessive value of appearance, and even worse, to disociation of sexuality, love and affection.
This is our way of disseminating erodization, this affects children directly, deforming their minds when we have eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and early erotization.
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her.
So, instead of limiting them, they put them in a tribe.
It becomes the family queen and not the family member.
It starts to decide the programs, the cardboard.
If it goes bad at school, school's guilt, we have to go talk to the teacher.
She gathers a lot, if what she needed would be presence.
She realizes that she increasingly doesn't have the authority of her parents.
A child, sometimes when he's two or three years old, realizes that his parents don't have authority, or evil, and insecure.
They need people who lead their lives.
This generates anxiety and generates symptoms.
We know that the importance of limits aren't fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children and we're losing this ability.
Instead, we are doing what the Americans call "Helicopstrape earlier."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world, making them not have life experience, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration with pain, with difficulty, and the world will certainly deliver them later.
This is the sin of the intronization and the superpower of childhood.
Well, facing so many problems, of course, childhood will give symptoms.
The child is going to be rebelled, flicker, birds, he'll get sick, he'll eat too much, he'll get obese, he'll get bad at school, don't pay attention, it's hyperactive, we need to do something about it.
It's not possible for these children in this way.
In the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain, what's the solution we'll give to bad behavior children?
Not reviewing all these problems, not thinking.
No, medicalization.
We'll give them medicine, late for them to behave well.
This is called medicalization and it's the worst of a sin.
The king of Mafalda says this, portrays in a wonderful way.
According to the story of a city polluted by a terribly polluted factory, people are going bad because of the paper, they go to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives medicine, they go home, buy medicines in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact, what the slum that is producing exactly the medicine.
And that's what we are doing for our children.
Not only with the allies children, the adults also, in a shameful way.
Currently, medicalization of the most derete phenomena.
In the United States, 15% of children today are as big as black, with this individualistic society, right?
The three employees are the market that grows the most before depressive.
We're arriving at this point.
And Ritalina, such as medicine, which is for the disturbance of attention and of activity, sold in 1999, 70,000 boxes.
In 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This is not a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood.
We're rotating, norming and preventing children to be themselves.
And I'm sure that, some of these geniuses, if any of these geniuses, in humanity, had today at school, it would be exactly this: rotated or not marty, and we would have sympathetic her genius, we'd have lost that wonderful thing that we've won a trash.
So we can see that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths.
And problems are very complex, I don't see them at the end of sines and factors that self-alimentate each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as a philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution, obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
That was what we thought about it.
A well-known TEDx solution.
I'm surely going through this, and I'll go through my time, but it's OK, just a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what can we do?
When we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence.
Penitence means payment in almost all churches.
The décima is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, which are our children, which are our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays?
Our capital, more important.
It's time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children.
100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing.
This doesn't happen every week, we start with it at the weekend.
It's possible to give time to our children.
In relation to space, I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fourteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I trust you.
Close your eyes in 15 seconds, imagine a healthy place.
A healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, is a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health and quality of life, not good for the cat to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes and tell me this way.
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows little importance of nature on the subject.
Nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with the human soul.
We know what makes us healthy.
It's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, it's all these factors, we know this.
What we don't know, and there was an interesting experience. I started that with Patricia, who back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!
I talked about the convergence and health of sustainability.
I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to my environment.
All health does well the environment and vice versa good.
To ride a bike is around the body, in my cities, pollution.
So collective sport does well for the time of convenience, reduces stress, reduces pollution.
And with my organic event, which was a body event, it does good for the rivers, it does good for the earth, it sees the animals.
Things always go around in a positive way, creating always viciosous.
And the invitation with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children.
It will reduce consumption of excessive material.
It will promote the play book that will generate intelligence, humour, imagination, creativity.
It will generate conviviality between families, loving people, and it will generate conviviality between children, different children who will know each other and learn how to deal with them, we will develop empathy, and promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physical, being psychic, mental.
And it will reduce all life problems.
This is a scientist, a man I'm talking about, studies show that he reduces obesity, aggressiveness, joy and exclusion, improves immunity, improves socialization and schooling, in a wonderful way, to take children to nature.
When I talk about bringing technologies, we're not talking about condemnical spaces with "gourmir" steps, you see, and now there'll be a "gry space."
No, we're talking about domination: the bread talking about jumping the wall and the city embracing the cities and playing in the squares, occupying public spaces, games, love, affection, and relief.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this.
And not only the initiative to use physics, but also by claiming that is why public policies facilitate us with public space, with nature.
that promote cycle, free events in these spaces, neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transportation to take us these places, safety.
Unforgettable and caregivers.
All of this is called occupation of a city.
The word "ocupaque" is practically used for resistance and citizens today, it means this, occupying public space with joy, and, mainly, taking part in the governance of cities.
The city governance is what makes a difference between catastrophes, as it happened in São Paulo, where you can see here, in a picture of the Billings Represa, a source of water from São Paulo, 30 to 40 years ago, and today, through slums and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they have returned, and people demand, public agendes returned by public interest, sustainability, with the compoundation of accounts.
There are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's cool for us to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, which is coming here, will come very early, our children will get me in, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing the inequality of the social point, and, of course, we'll learn to take care of others, and we'll reduce inequality.
When we take the children to nature, we'll make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold caching, not seeing YouTube, and we learn more about this box and we'll defend them in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children already outside.
Família already abroad.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces, with play, with entertainment, with participation.
As we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing a phase of Eduardo Galiano that gave us that year, unfortunately.
He said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he gets away.
If you take me a thousand steps, it pushes a thousand steps.
So, what is utopia good for?
Exactly to not make us walk.
That it makes us walk abroad.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
In 2007, I came across a large group of young people and adults with disabilities excluded from regular education.
Since then, my biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutico," which is the group of parents, students and friends, in search of a really inclusive society, to discuss inclusion inside school, with parents, children and partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they introduce this to parents, to the community, and to the society of general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside, stop having friends because they think they are not able to have friends, to interact with people.
As for example, the student Igor, who in the other school he studied for four years didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
And people didn't have the strength to do that either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education and, as he loved to run, he kept running all the time.
When I got to the clean field, I sought to know Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do so that he could get a better learning.
The school, for Igor, was a place of despair.
Well, it doesn't mean it's a pulmpo, today he's very happy.
He has classes, with several teachers, and has many friends, and he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy, freedom of expression.
And they can teach students to enjoy their own learning process.
The schools think they are not able to attend these students and that they are prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties, and that these quitments, inside the school, do good for them, will do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
Why is school like this?
There's what I know, what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see it.
I learned to use my hearing, living with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs with those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who, many times, have difficulties in understanding what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students, to create connections and bonds of friendships.
And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise of empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Good evening.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother, cooking, working in the kitchen.
She was taking into account of Christmas seeds, again, Páscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to put their hand on the mass together with her, in fact, it was my brother.
So much so that, until today, she asks me, "How, and why did I stop in the kitchen?"
And that's the answer I want to give to you today.
Because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
So, "oga" has transformed me.
It completely transformed my life.
It changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I started to realize that food had power, let's say.
I also decided to study food philosophies that could use food as a prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
Because these philosophy revealed something that I think is that modernization took away from many of us young people, zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could change the way we build the food system through food.
I believe that one of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the apartment of urban life and rural life.
I believe that if we bring a little from rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between men and nature.
For example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the meat process.
There are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale, it's quantity and speed.
The more you produce, the cheaper you produce, the higher the quality, and the higher the cost for the environment and for our health.
In terms of speed, the animal's cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, it's artificially accelerated, and it loses, it starts to grow and produce, in a way, that its bodies arrive an hour that doesn't end up, and it starts to lose, diminish drastically, their health and time of life.
I believe we can and must change this food system.
I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's quilo was cheaper than tomorrow's kilo.
I said, "Guys, how can you do it?"
This is very complex.
How can it cost so little, to create an animal from birth to abate?
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very - let's say it's harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, today, Brazil is the world's biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse, in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society has inverted values.
There is an investment of values.
Why does a person worry about not buying a falsified perfume because they think they'll have an alertical reaction because they don't know the origin, they don't know what kind of chemistry there, and don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal?
Why is that?
I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values.
And we need to teach people how to value organic products, because when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, a little bit of organic leface, you're paying, not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that, behind that leface, there was someone who took care of, with all affection, and took this lettuctuce to you.
So we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I think I fell in love with culinity and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still going hungry?
And the reason is a bad policy of distribution.
We have to revert this.
In terms of consumption, the way we consume food today is scary.
My grandmother is a paulist.
She marked in São Paulo.
If I take it in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure it's to be very scared, seeing those tests walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swimming a piece of pizza, for example.
Because to hurt is something that people, many people think it's a waste of time, but it's really very important.
So, she'd have almost a fivethpaste, but because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding.
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV.
This makes us lose the notion of satiety.
We end up opening the street space, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo Huriaçúcar," which are the three altrugicious, right?
Mainly the tasks of flavors end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, but also a mental dependency, a psychological dependency, a physiological dependence.
That is, industrialized products in excess are very harmful.
I don't even call them food.
For me, there are measures of food models, because you can even consume, satisfy, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panick?
That panel poop in the place of microwaves.
Look!
Made, half.
(Laughter) Who here is still a cake, instead of buying a small bag of package?
Audience: Oh!
Also, half a half.
(Laughter) This question, these two questions may seem a little harmful, not to say anything, but, in fact, it means many.
You can change the panel's popcorn by the microonds' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you'll be consuming chemicals that you wouldn't wear, I'm sure, absolute, with the packaging of the microwaves.
It's a packaging that could be less trash in the world.
So I think that excessive consumption of industrialized products is really harmful.
To summarize this question of the food production process, I think it's a lot about the food dynamic that this food system isn't healthy.
It's not working.
And we must change.
But how can we change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook is synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Cozinharing brings independence, brings self-awareness, gives autonomy, brings safety, and brings freedom.
To cook is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry.
Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
If you let the industry feed you, it'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazy, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgger, and dog.
What about a pizza?
What a "scipizza" branch.
Because not even bad people we know how to do more.
So I believe that we - it's not -
The guy there.
Where is the rice and the bean?
Where is the kissing rice every day that embraces our belly and our soul?
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, who think that making very work, very anti-personatic food is a waste of time.
But, for example, if you leave the nightmaped bean, the morning breakfast, and in 20 minutes, you have a bean in the pressure panel.
I want you to simply pick up one day, make a bean, get frozen for the rest of the week.
Sundaying with a street, fresh who you do in 20, 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the meal, ready.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppet to arrive, to wait for the pepper of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, how we see the act of cooking.
Everyone can and must cook.
Men, woman, boy, girl, child, adult, and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender.
Everybody can cook.
Everybody must cook.
Changing education, we teach children, taking children to fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting practical children with a battle, lavalous things, simple things of our daily lives, we can build a better future.
These children will grow with a holistic view of the world.
They'll know where the food comes from, because many people think it's from the supermarket shelter.
Children will grow independent of the food industry because they will know how to cook.
They will grow independent from the pharmaceutical industry, because they'll be much less sick, growing up eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change the dynamic of food.
We have to change our appreciation with food.
We have to value food more, value the act of eating and cooking.
Education isn't just talking, please, thanks to your permit.
Education doesn't mean to understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think that having a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention.
So, the future of food will decide the future of humanity.
To cook and choose well food are choices we can make to change the world for better.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Life isn't here that we've lived, but it's the one we wake up and how we wake up to count.
To have those who went deep down to talk about the power of transforming stories is to pass through my own story, because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical shelter in Brazil, here in the terraces of Butián.
And then, he got married with my helpful grandmother and had seven children, inside them my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world.
Basically, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are.
When we tell them, we transform ourselves.
Those who listen can also be transformed.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our story.
Before looking at this future, we need to see who came back and honor, all stories.
My passion for stories started very early.
I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "discamids," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to live the mourning, and I know it helped a lot of people too.
So having told this and told this story, for me, brings one of the most beautiful things about it, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because, obviously, someone will come and sit on the lap of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood at 45 years that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
So I started to help people tell their stories.
Because the publicity world had become very small to me.
So, I started doing this.
And one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's.
Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable nowadays.
But he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying, because that's what he'd always suffered and he wanted to share the story with others.
And I left because I had to do with the subject.
But Tiago, while we were preparing to talk about him, there was always a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints, a right, about everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, to be to keep complaining about who did that with us?
And if not, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can take responsibility for who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who understood that, was changing the top.
And, on the day, Tiago grew up on stage.
And he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
I like to tell this a lot, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also of having seen that the roots they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defense.
They started to understand him better and he welcomed himself.
Just as he welcomed, I'll tell his story, many people welcomed in his story.
Last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him, even more at a time that is so caring for dialogue and acceptance, to tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story.
who wanted to share the problems they had on their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story and hadn't taken this to people in a way that didn't have any shame.
So, telling stories to me provoke micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many.
They are only in their own, but in mine too.
Everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we speak to listen, we transform ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years, training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience, tell something funny, shows your children's photo.
But, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule, it has to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
About this, I told the story of the habit.
Avio is the teacher of the Economic university in Jerus beyond.
Research is listening.
We spent months preparing his speech at TEDx Lossador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
One day, two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this."
Every time you talk to me, you tell me, everything is here, everything is here, and shows me your head, how much, actually, you have to leave everything here, you have to be your heart.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to the other.
How was the fact that he had been listened to when he needed more, when he committed suicide when he had cancer, which made him study about it?
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many editing courses, oratory, writing, but who is worried about learning how to listen?
Because he tells me, and we saw this today, that the more we really hear, we truly transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we're going to change, let's change.
So we talk about change, but there's always this fear.
And like this fear, we always arrive and say, "I won't even listen."
We give ourselves and to others.
And listening comes, also, before that famous word: empathy.
We talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to embrace and say something.
We don't have time for people because we're worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
After hearing his talk, another TEDx returned.
And empathy has another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the variousest stories I heard, outside all the others.
That empathy too, I learned collectivity when she taught me that we need to look yes to the problem of homeless people, for example.
When we say on the street, many of us say that we have nothing to give, when they ask us something, we have yes.
We have at least a smile, and it doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear, and we tell, that make us who we are.
And by listening, the other really, we transform ourselves.
And if another listens, and counts, it also transforms itself.
And in the middle of the poor preparation, which was this process here for me, was outside my trip. (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today, teaching something, doing something, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much?"
Why are you doing this now and helping people?
And the answer to me, and to everyone, came from a poem I wrote myself, and now you apologize me, but I'll read.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
The fourth of the flaws.
The salt of values?
It was the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
To show them faith in life.
Faith in some humans.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
that they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Liberation of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
What about you?
Stories you'll tell about your lives.
Stories, you want you to talk about you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, it's because, in fact, I'm part of the true space, or you'll say there are judgments, where all sorts of stars exist.
And the stars don't have labels or classifications.
They are only part of their plurial spaces.
There's no fat formula or thin, pretty ugly, rich and poor.
For them, it's only a legacy of existence. This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed over my life, a phase in which I was denied the right of just being.
However, resisting and existing has always been a life condition for me, since the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her when she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
And that's why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and Strelagião in the sky.
The universe is infinite and, along with them, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, no flush shine or the beauty of the other.
So, why are we here, below, so tiny, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy and understanding exactly that the different one agrees?
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
So that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
The different thing is beauty.
It's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives.
And this is what is rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you.
Permit yourself.
Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Or if starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball.
It was where I could be the same.
It was where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, or where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
(Laughter) But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied for me?
Or better, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple: the fact that I'm different.
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it comes to the trans universe, this path is even more difficult.
I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me.
I didn't even know what trans people were.
And for my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me.
Folks, I want to become trans, too.
Everyone coming, so she thought at the beginning of the wrong way, which is to mirror me in the other.
So, during my graduation in Artescenica, I had the opportunity to meet myself, from inside.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life.
It was in theater that I learned how to deal with differences.
It was in theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my real teenage years, and I started to get rid of it.
It's as if you enter a cockle, stay a while there, that's a beautiful ballot.
Through this process, he has painful phases and not everyone is prepared to deal with.
It's difficult when you're in the middle of a change attempt, and you still have to learn to deal with not accepting others.
There's a lot of empathy in this world.
And if you're a woman, black, fat, this path is harder.
We spent many tests daily.
In the case of us, trans, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They get uncomfortable with their transformation.
Your process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But play, can you really move?"
You don't have traffic faces.
No, only this is easy, it's going to pass.
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is there any gourm here who wants to see this extinct?
While the man exists, he has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this, that they call the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 people who were killed here in Brazil, 2016, in factories 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
Being trans in an option, but in a life condition.
There's no magic formula.
When there's one ... I get a big drill and a strength, resistance, expectation of 35 years.
There's no way.
Whoever wants it to be like that?
We could better measure this panel better.
But it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, because each one of us is the protagonist of your own story.
Understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world, and only depends on us.
For example, I'm the living proof of this.
After I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my art as a way of deconstruction of ideas to establish myself.
I wanted to play on YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people, not only transgender people.
I remembering a life experience for many people, I saw myself being a model, magazine layer, J, and "perform" and "outuber," and at the apex of my career, in an immensority that exhibited this novel for more than one million people in 130 countries.
MMS: It's a responsibility ... (Applause) It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, to so many people, to represent a flag and to be proud of all that I represent with it.
But that's how I did.
I was really there and gave my name.
I talked and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "It's a comment book like a man who's capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
(Applause) What has no price is to receive message from mothers from other trans girls, thank me, for laughing, for teaching them more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me, for seeing me there and seeing me.
This has no price.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
But today I also understand that I don't want to be just an actress.
Three, I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond trans.
But to understand that, taking a post of unknown requires to really understand that we are many.
We are plurial beings.
The difference adds.
The sky is the refuge of allies.
Who was me, an alarm person.
Inmensity, freedom without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
Some looks.
I don't need to stop.
I've already got away from my corridors.
From the past, only what remain their scars, that mark my soul.
But it's a future.
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being beside me, now I am, now I'm going to fly.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology.
I joined working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
I've been doing this for many years and accompanying children.
Even with all my knowledge, communication, I couldn't often explain to children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian score, that doctors called "teratoma."
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get out of tumors, you won't get a sixth grade."
Well, it had been called, right?
But I saw that, at the hospital, I could operate.
I was already used to doctors and nurses.
So I decided to do the surgery there.
I gained courage.
It had never been established, given point: nothing.
It was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure.
I woke up ten hours later and noted.
In the same yesterday, I stayed with children with cancer.
I looked down, full of tubes and connections, the whole stomach was covered.
I called nurse and asked, " cancer?"
She said, "Yes."
I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's out of the visitor's time."
And then I asked her to give me her hand until I sleep.
I cut only after the bedroom.
With cancer, measures and committed gangs.
I'd talk to kids, don't give Google, because, after all, it wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So I looked for information in a safe place.
I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was safe in that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And, in that time, I realized so much of information that sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage.
And how are you going to engage someone if you can't even say a word: cancer?
I was loaded, opened what bothered me, avoided, calm down.
But my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair.
In fact, the crazy wasn't for me, the piruque was for them, that he couldn't see me as a doll.
With this, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the most suitable.
When I entered the hospital, the forest, the children said, "Wow!
If you shaved your hair to stay like us, I said, "No, now I'm like you."
I got cancer.
I took it from you.
Put it out.
Don't take it, OK?
You can stay close to me.
It doesn't take it.
But the games overcomed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures.
When I went to put the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, I received a hospital kit.
The kit came with a sabone, a paste and a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
For me, this is information.
I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did.
And I'd send the kids to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through this."
And what happened?
The children started to give me back their procedures.
So they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio.
Many procedures until I didn't do that, they taught me.
We went on, we were joking, but that's how we think the child doesn't understand, right?
I think the child doesn't know.
We don't know the protocol, the name of chemotherapy, procedures, all that.
Many of the parents try not to protect them, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls."
Then the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy, and the pharmacist talks is a strong remedy, what will she find?
Go here, it's your hair."
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it killed cells that doubled rapidly, but not only tumor cells doubled rapidly, but also hair cells, they even understood,
It's working and it started to engage children.
We started to talk a lot about procedures.
It's a day when doctors started to call me, "If there's a patient who'll place catheter, you can come here, then I'll go there."
There's a patient who will amput a leg, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have both legs."
"Ah, but then the advantage comes running," and I went there.
Until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising.
I called health professionals and my creative friends, and we decided to open an NGO, and we opened B.A.
It's called BABA because it's cancer BAB.
What did we do?
Usually, those who make health information are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But the patient approached the end.
This entrance in the patient is in the middle, but at the end of the process.
We decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
We'd spend a long time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about.
With that, we illustrated the most common terms of cancer environment.
We illustrated all this with the support of health professionals, but with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained.
When you like someone and you wrote, I love you with your heart, you draw ventricolous drawings.
"Your child is bigger."
And it started to do that.
And these children started to understand even more about the processes.
In these terms, our first material came out, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute for children in treatment.
Unfortunately, we can only do about 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
We go to a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened?
The hospitals started to use, to ask, we're in more than 40 hospitals in Brazil.
The kids outside started to see and started to ask.
A new Zeland from Japan, from many places.
I'd say, "But it's in Portuguese," she said, but we have a translator, and the guide is very asked in the north, northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do.
With this, we started to dismiss and engage the patient to do several other actions.
The information is very important.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics.
This information is a slope in a kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That you need to have information about everything.
For example, I don't know if you know more, when they do events, black children earn much more present and pay attention than children.
Sometimes the doll child has already done the treatment, there's no cancer.
Sometimes children are tied up with cancer because they don't have chemotherapy.
The palliative ones or they don't have anything at the moment.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising child, and we know if you put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look.
It doesn't stop everything well, it doesn't have it.
And what happens with this?
And when are you the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, dark, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship?
And then, you think, I receive calls from parents and mothers with healthy children, who call me and say, "My daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there's a child with an adult who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see and with my life is good, and when we need self-esteem, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important that we give a little bit of attention to this too, not only to patients for society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with much love, because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest."
I just don't stop what I don't want.
Fortunately, this isn't easy because the dependence here gives me a disease and a brain disease.
And a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat dependency here?
What if, in fact, these patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things.
One of these things is in our own body.
This organism that has its own defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats.
One of those defenses is in our brain.
It's called "barring emato in being a factory."
The matocefal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain, and that make bacteria and non-violent substances enter our brain and don't do bad in our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier.
They're very small molecules and, since they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the packaging barrier.
And that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
In this video, you can see the macrophogo in the blood stream, running after a bacterium, until it can inflate it, fagocit it and neutralize it.
So, could we not gather these two things to try to help our patients?
Two mechanisms of defense, which are inactive, which are ours.
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues.
Until the day some researchers in the United States, studying the people who end up using big drug quantities, realized that these people who used more drugs produce anticpiosis against drugs themselves.
It's almost as if the immune system told them,
It's enough!
There's no need for more drugs in the system.
It's overcarded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
My team and I have been researching for a few years, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is capable of sending this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work?
The change enters our body, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-codfos are big molecules, and then that problem that the barrier initial to be false had to let the drug go freely, it doesn't exist because when the user consumes drugs.
It's good.
It's no longer on the blind mato barrier.
Don't look at this image here how this beautiful process is.
On the right of you, we have a while that hasn't received the vaccine.
These white dots you can see is a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Once we were able to imunize them, and you can see, on the left side of you, there is a significant diminution of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that was passing by.
We asked ourselves, "Where did she stop, since she didn't happen?"
And it's very interesting that vaccinated rats have a much greater radiation in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocking the passage, it's a sharing of the molecules of radiation in the blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, who received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received the drugs.
They're standing inside the box or more inhibited than the rats they receive cocaine.
What our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people gain freedom.
We believe that this treatment, the therapeutic vaccine or the antidrogen vaccine, can be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependence.
Maybe some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time, time to decide.
A time to gain new freedom and discuss with themselves, if they want to use drugs or not.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I've been a psychotherapist for more than 40 years.
I want to tell you that beyond neuron, besides psychosis, there is a terrible disease.
It's a nefasta disease, in fact, already in Villenu, Pierre goes and I call it "normose," normality pathology.
And I have to say that the great meeting of this TEDx, our portal, is that girlfriend is being punished from the beginning.
What is the norm?
They are habits, attitudes, filled with social consensus, a set of pathogenic and pathological behaviors, in some way, in some way.
The legal war, for example.
Maybe the most mortifero example of what is ours.
Up to where I can comprehend, there are two fundamentals, the most important ones of the norm.
It's the systemic, systemic location.
The other is evolution.
The system, the location, says respect to the fact that not always the norm has existed, it won't always exist.
The norm is a typical disease, we coexist in a context, the violence of moments where the lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, in its words, egocentrism.
So, what's normal?
This is adapting to a sick and healthy system.
I've been a worker for more than 31 years from the International University of Paz, Unipaz.
And people think that peace is to be in good, that peace is absence of conflicts.
"No!"
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like ugly, Chinese wisdom, is estagnancy.
How many wars, I said, I came ... a little bit of payments.
The soldier for peace.
But for other areas.
Weapons of awareness, of responsibility, of compassive love.
So, in the same way, health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes, healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even a conscious despair, lucid, an indignation, fair.
This reminds me of a family word.
The mother asked me, "What is the princess you like most?"
The flywheel bark, sleeps it, the fallen asleep?
She thought and answered, "I like all the biggest writing.
I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, I love contradictions, because it has the sensibility to feel in your own skin that norms aren't being.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all were sensitive people to not say sensitive, who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's the fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals being destroyed, of forests, being desertified.
These people would die.
I don't respect a lot, people named psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy are also considered sacred.
Because they are like a paragaid that captures cultural and systemic contradictions.
And sometimes I fail.
As I said, the difference between a grain and a mad person is that the sake knows, swimming where the other doesn't know and doesn't speak.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call "siquatic," are failed saints.
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is in Armodes, we don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here, knowing I was Porto Alegre, a psychotherapist told me, "Doctor, I have a problem at home.
My son is good.
He's kind.
He raises himself to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's silly.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son?"
Is it good?
Do you understand that I'm trying to say, why not brothers?
So, I must say that all people who respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately.
How this fabulous team that organized this meeting.
(Applause) And nothing against certainty.
At that moment, we have to suffer from a distress.
So, you've talked about the norms, machismo, racism, homophobia, of diverse exclusions.
"Momose!"
Could we talk about the environmental norm?
The nursery of another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
(Laughter) And that the cake sky catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, it takes me and doesn't realize its existence in time.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about making the appology of the generalist, but it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe there's a concept in this education that has also been pointing as a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deeper voice of the desire that brought us incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage like this.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here only by a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would offend.
So, a foundation of the norm is the location.
There's another, very important.
I evolve.
It's also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us from a bird, a snake, a monkey?
I think of a friend of Uni Paz, an alternative Nobel Prize, an economy of developing country, Mr. Freeth Max, Life, Chile.
When I met my illness, he told us that, since the boy, he wanted to know that the human being was different from other species.
Is it intelligence?
"No!"
Is language?
"No!"
It's culture.
"No!"
Is humor?
"No!"
One day, talking to his father, that very respectful, his father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
(Laughter) He opened a little light and said he became the first stupidologist.
(Laughter) Supidology is science that we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is absolutely indigenous.
I like to remember Rolentur, the creator of biodiction, a great brother, and he told us that we need to be a hipotalic stupid, to be a good animal, from holiday to the chest which will be Bral.
The question is stupidity because it relies on rationality.
And to do it as a person who is talking about sophisticated development, as a person sitting in the branch of a tree, breaking.
Ninest also said that, for him, there were only two infinite things: the universe in this human tupidity.
And he agreed, "No, no, in relation to a universe I still have my doubts."
(Laughter) But I need to say that I agree with Einstein and Max Nefing, although they respect them and considering that they are pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the norm.
Human beings aren't from nature, stupidity, on the contrary.
We are born to be, to flourish, to serve.
So, I'd rather think of confuse that, 2600 years ago, said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inacabase, it's unpleasant.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A tortuga was born, born, never, have you ever seen?
And go to the sea!"
We don't.
Are we inaccabated?
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
Have you ever heard of school for turtles?
Or for the jury?
It's education, it's perfect, we're imperfectable.
And it's not just about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems to be necessary to develop a rational landing.
"No.
It's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul's soul.
To develop emotional intelligence, unirical intelligence of dreams.
Learn to read the book at night.
But we also need to develop a consential alphabetization.
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
He summarized his own confusion, and guided my heart to learn, at 15 years old, his long existence.
At 30 I set a species firmly on the floor.
The 40s weren't suffering from "perplexity."
Around 50 I knew what the precets of the sky were.
At 60, I heard sweet invitation.
In the 70s, I could follow the instructions of my own heart, because what I wanted wasn't that day, the borders of justice.
Even though Alexandria' therapists told us two thousand years ago, "You exchange clothes and 5 million."
It should be a whole existence to change cancer.
This is the task.
In this way, norm refers to an evolutionary establishment.
They are people who didn't invest in the most properly human potential.
That's why I like to trust that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: will there be the 21st century for human beings?
Nothing less than this finds this paradox, the future of new generations.
So the norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist.
He understood the natural evolution of human beings, but the human being, where their own nature can learn to know themselves, to know themselves how to be, to smile, when to serve.
Someone asked the IP, "Faline of God."
And IP fell.
Maybe there's a way to talk about the mystery in the great life, it's flowing with human beings who, potentially, are.
So, I want to talk about a story that we listen to "nonipas."
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned with us about this story.
Once upon a time, it was a fire forest.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, as I said, that picked up a source, a water drop, and played in the middle of the fire.
And back, resiliently, another gota, lawyer in the middle of fire.
And I'd return with patience, the lines, which little friends, were playing in the middle of the fire.
In Tatufo, already seeing that, said more, "Let's see Flow, do you think that with those dropleted particles, will you turn off this infernal shell?"
And I leave the flower and say, "I know no, my friend Tatu."
Now, I'm doing my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who want to change the world of society sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way, because without having before, they transform themselves.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square, and the first responsibility is to introduce a little of peace, a little of order, a little of love, in this little part of the world, that the great world tries to each one of us.
What if we don't do this, where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
Because of these revolutions failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration, which is to breathe consently, with others, with others, with the world and with stress.
I recommend a book, "The Aquarian conspiration of Marilyn Fex," who studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a giant radio.
The beija-flor has no ideology.
He has no flag.
He's not blaming anyone.
I'm not pushing anyone.
He is part of him.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
The most powerful thing is to do our part.
As a matter of fact, since the morning, I'm seeing the diapers who came, each one talking about their water had water.
All of us who are needed, all of us, but on the stage, your little water drop, because we can always turn a candle at some point, they will be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, your life story is instead of just complaining about the darkness.
So I want to conclude by saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time for renewation.
I love poets.
I believe that we read love with bread and poetry will still save the world.
I want to conclude with the poem of Ceciliia Menêus, "Renovate!
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
And it applies you to have arms at CNRS all.
They close the eyes they had seen.
There were others for other perspectives.
Give arms that have this remote, so that you forget the harvest.
It's always the same.
I always hear.
But always high.
Always far.
And inside of everything.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I entered a good school.
Decória.
I got good grades.
choose a job that will define you for the rest of your life as a child.
Always, being a lawyer, an advertising or a bill, since my mother has a income.
They take a college of resignation, of public preference.
Almost four or five years ago, using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
Some multinational name was recognized by their relatives.
Be three in me.
She works 12 hours per diphic, up to the limit of her strength.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
Do intermediate meetings.
"Diocosque" that would not take anywhere.
show that you're important for the structure.
More than working, it's important to appear and to be always producing.
He sees the shirt.
I carry a six fallakes dot.
There's someone named, girlfriend, marriage.
M mini speakers.
Scalled corporative pyramid.
Inspire the shirt.
Walkets.
A lot of job.
Be a manager.

Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son.
Easy.
(Laughter) Change the car, year yes, no year.
She bought an apartment and holds 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter) Disney?
Two years later, all of seven days per Europe, Miami.
Europe.
Very well.
There are more meetings that don't take anywhere.
People completely unqualified, being promoted, before you.
Projects that start and devastate like their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
He sees the shirt.
They should socially be safe every day.
(Laughter) The first apartment on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle-time crisis.
The meeting with my colleagues at the college.
My God, some years went fast.
Life is short.
The kids at school.
My God, as they grew fast.
In life it's short.
Classes very well cut by rings from the center.
You're a principal.
You are an anonymous society.
The first place.
After week on the beach at the weekend in the mountain.
We'll sell the beach apartment, children grow up and don't even want to go further.
Listen, the shirt.
The waiting thing is so little high.
Her body flattered, like an astronaut who spent years, fighting for zero gravity.
(Laughter) No face and because of the healthy habit of going through dental thread, I place all infections.
(Laughter) FI gluten, cold lactose, green juice.
So weekly from the academic that you used for two months.
It's a quarter, a beany day.
It's a burguese to stay late, at the sign, to close a project, because life is too short to eat easy.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing a job.
We don't value experience anymore.
The fear of everything.
From the new generations, the change, the new one.
Because, in my time, continuous fear prevents you from living.
Fear of death.
A fair sense of suffocation.
Where is the air?
If not, I'm focused.
The complete disconnection with its children decorated from the 12 hours of work field for decades.
The empty retirement, surrounded by useless and unhappy things.
You're a winner.
This is your only consumption.
His life as an executive executive.
He saw the wood shirt for the real time.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
