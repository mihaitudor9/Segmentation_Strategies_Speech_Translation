(Applause) (Music)
Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference...
What this issue brought me so much, or if it should have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dressed room that embraces everyone, people with no disabilities, today I'll tell you why I work with this.
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does he dress? Is there any difficulty in wearing clothes?
Does it need someone's help or do it?
Is there any interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that attained their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play.
And outside that they lost a lot of time and lost money, and they often stopped using something they'd really like, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their body.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist, was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was a fashion with other disabled women, and I made her a lady with a very high cause, elastic in her seat to make greater comfort, and made a discreet to make her exchange of the probe that is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
I made Carlena a blouse opening on her shoulders.
With the closure of pressure button, to make it easier when it comes to mind.
In fact, for quadriplegic people, the ideal is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic, who gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a seat ...
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in arms so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
And for women, with anism or low status, the ideal is to think of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes in the childish session.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and corderous.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
This means that in Brazil there are more than 45 million people with some disability.
More than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana?
And I took the second place.
I...
Silvana ...
A "drika."
And many other people ...
Several other stylists ...
Little brands are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed brands, that were already launching inclusive collections due to the size of success which was the first, and Target also American recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all need to think about it, we must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
[A.DE.]
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
My community, we started to work with garbage, and I started to make people as a four-year-old child, up to adolescence, and go through adulthood.
Putting the beginning: knowing how to separate one trash from another.
So I tried to talk to children and it was making awareness of their parents.
Parents were giving me the children.
People recognize me in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate.
But nowadays I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I do with the children I know.
In my community, we have a collection of seeds when we go to the forest.
I'll work with SAF.
Do we have a plantation?
Once I met a plant called Hengar's name, she's a legominous plant.
And we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I eat.
On top of it, we have a good result in our community.
When did he go to the arm?
There I knew that all plants -
It was used each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate like a small forest, right?
So, you have to imitate forest, because in your arms ...
There was a lot of plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Isn't it?
So, I tried to plant them, variating, there I have the assau, the cup, graviola, Andiróba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná.
And everything there can't be a plague, (English) "Light, how?"
There everything natural, at EBRAPA, I saw there was a lot of poison, a lot of toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit on the side, without comparison to ours: in our community, we worked all there with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural, you don't have toxicity in our community, OK?
(Laughter)
To accompany human beings as an animal.
The child, I compare her and count only to pay, you talk, she's there listening, and then passing me to other children.
Popagai was watching this attention, then he talked about animal quote, so I compared the child like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection, the most caught by those children.
So, I was looking for my knowledge, and it was putting everything in the army, "The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from our homes."
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person who observes my house.
I kept observing my house and ... Audience: She kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's just fine.
So, I saw that all this that my work was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's to work out.
And today we have ...
A job in the corner is far from the atom.
Iskelô going to take?
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tartaruga of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river, which before had a hooligan in front of us, above or little in our community.
And ...
This hooligan, she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I'm going to talk to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about... Audience: Oh!
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... we breathe a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest ... (Laughter)
Is it always being talking to people teaching children?
And ...
And I'm passing with other people, and I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small, that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, I reach people and come to be next to us.
Let's talk about it, how do we bring people into practice?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Oh, guys, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you very much, guys.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
My family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream of reality and create this family.
(Laughter) This puts risk life.
Imagine all the most blind people who are here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
We took ... and we had two options.
Choose us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep looking for an optical melody to think.
The first message was very incredible because all our friends, from there, it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the most friends, gave us a very important message for all of us, first for us, and then for all the rest of the world, so that he can make a fear transplant, what he needs to be cured.
It was that when a child has leukemia and he has a life risk, all or the rest of fears, worries, doesn't matter.
The second message he had with this disease, public and all this movement of finding a donor was that people saw us as a family, or more importantly life, the fight for life and for love, was that people saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or one more divorced warrior, or important, I love the family, this union, this is what gives strength, this that gives life, this will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trankède passed us with this disease to the world, "What?"
My blood, my mulla oil, we can manufacture them, so it has the capacity to donate blood for those who need it, and it's not just our factory.
For someone with blood cancer, if it's needed in the leaves, when we have an accident, at any time everybody's ecosysteming and need, and donating oil medicine, if each road as a donor of oil medication, the possibility of compatibility.
So, if you go to all of us, then I thank all of you, "Oh, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be able to be waiting for them to call me to save my life, you can be a hero, I, when I got married, "Oh, it's just donating a part of me," to be able to save in life, and it's only something, more beautiful.
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate módulos to save lives and be superheroes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
It's called Laikon.
Basically, for you.
(Video) The base is like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Talola del Chinau, I'm Syrian, born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
In January, I studied at Damasco University, today, I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little ...
(Laughter) Or this, in French, in Portuguese.
I saw excuses, without a few moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brocancer," which exerces Slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with "slam."
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap and easy to live in the population was 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew since I was a child.
Two apartments and I loved to meet the world, an engineering office, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15th, 2011 in drama, then it came to all other cities of the country.
My city of the mask was the saferest of Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day, two, five years of war, or my country is destroyed.
People I know were forced to carry or left their children, they found their injured voices and mutilated by a family bomb, disappeared and didn't come back. My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian are dead or refugeed in other countries, they saw everything.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria, they still live there, and I don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father and my brother because our bars and our life remained behind.
It's about how Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk in Brazilian Baixada and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why had more opportunities?
And the Tevia Pinas, or a week, to leave brains.
Fifty years of my life ...
It's starting again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, in Brazil, Braseleirinha, Sara, nine months, and everybody talked very well about the food that my good friends said very well.
And making food to sell, that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now, everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) (Applause) I'm there with Syria.
(Laughter) I make food and I deliver the Whatsapp Youb. (Laughter)
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, many people had a wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islã, today in the morning, or a journalist says to me, "I, after this happened in France, now and I don't want to talk, or talk, the contact with a person is a submano.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the French soy, but also Branus, who is spreading Islam's image, or a basic religion, or Ovoso, in our sacred book since a person is allowed to kill the name of religion, but, exactly, to the courte, about your mother of the school, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, I don't understand any type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like culture and religion differences.
When one of them came, a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief I covered hair, just like my wife, and my wife asks questions like, "Why do you use this lesson at home too?"
The Jabi village today has other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, and kiss, ex-usted goods from wedding, but I've already seen some humans who do all this.
See that Taoislam has these rules, but it goes from each person wanting to buy, or not, to kiss, hug, to beat alone, it's not allowed as a bordo box on alcoholic drinks.
When I left the arsang in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I'd drink alcohol or had sex with more than a partner.
This will never happen to me, (Laughter) because these things are forgotten by Islam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But in spite of not knowing Moislam, after the Exibican Agency, those of you always understand respect, the "Profeta Mohammedes" that we must respect all religions, that all people have the same value that we should have with all of us.
It doesn't matter if they are white, black or Indians, or they also isolate since we should help the poorest people, it doesn't matter if the poor are Christian beings.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows better or Islam.
And your children?
Valbuder, grow together based on it, or steal the moleque.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my tears, in the Sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the tears of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe it, soon I lose hope, but in the daily bucket I know who suffers: "Geee, I eat," my salary ends, just like this race, I study the girl, it was what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand a service opportunity, there were a lot, a cook.
Faxineira, why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, I give myself an opportunity, and the mouse told me, "The days pass, the months fly, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation, and if you don't care, to pay a secret course.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, enter that little side that the vessor is waiting, welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, the page I created on Facebook, like the newspaper, wasn't yet programmed, so I picked up one day, in the middle of my life, sometimes not time to think and see everything we've achieved in life, so that, in case, other people have gone through this, they compassionate, and I kept following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
Then, soon afterwards, I put my first story on the internet, I had to bring the yesterday, I couldn't use her cup in her house, nor the bathroom, I was hired to be a cooker to feed me with her own food.
At her house -
There was a bathroom for houses, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared this first story on the internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive advertisements, which I titled as abusesive advertisers, I interviewed many media, both the international media, the national media, London's tons, Germany TV, and so completely different here in our country, for example, an advertisement I read.
It was for workers and working on a second, access.
For day, week, much less, every month, 300 and 80 real reais per month, which is our condition here in Brazil, there are domestications going through these conditions still today, there are domestic ones, not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities.
And then I was very excited to experience so many books, and I started doing paper, it became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, rubbed everything quickly, I left half an hour to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I enter a room that I found something that I call humanized treatment, which is the Regina entered the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing the experiences I'd already experienced in the past, and then she started to spread several texts, which, in 2009, when I went to college, I was very nervous, and then she sat there with me and said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Wow, I started to take a little and saw there was a book and an exhaust."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I'm here to generate uncomfortable."
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, right?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service, my grandmother was a maid?
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established that, that, and so on, and that's you?
Yes, or I'm magical ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not to have a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the houses today.
The modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
Audience: Yes.
She ran away, hurt, and I denied, because I waited for a long time for her to get there on Friday of payment, I hear her going out with her clothes, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Menine, it was so stressed!"
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother was always going to work, there wasn't much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I just wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding.
Because Christmas and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little lower of the employee, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who's going to work, but he goes back home, to host him, and the only solution I had is when my boss will work.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can run away from his cassettes, because when I say I'm going to change employment, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you gain 1,800 reais per month, you'll never get this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala."
Because my saving poin is my peak, and then I was there, in the salt of service, squeezing, I got my tear power, and made it in number one, and my backyard, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you wearing the tear poem, your bathroom can use the toilet, and I couldn't use the bathroom, and there was no room for this that I brought the soil poth?"
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for your family to serve."
So, you have to be happy, being able to come, so I'm here telling you the statistics: black woman, fat woman ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)
(Applause) Black woman, fat, teacher, peripherical and laughing.
I'm not doing here today.
Behind me, there are 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do, I would run that my life doesn't think of money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
Because in other countries various domestications work and study, and here this domestic work has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, it's a uniform to be able to identify it, so I'm talking about six million households.
They're from African foundings and not mandated.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) I'm here today to talk ... (Music) (Music) (Music)
About silencing.
What's already a bit funny about exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
I first take the time of my talk to disconnect.
You turn off your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because they're dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Who says that silence is a door to who we are emotionally?
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself ...
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
And I had it.
Around 30 years of yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
Open the agenda.
Take your eye.
It's insecurity, with equipment, marvelous inflammation points.
The first step ofuriation.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book and I was sure that I wasn't going to account.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos.
I remembered an author's quote, he spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
That feeling, from that moment of presence ...
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
The human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Much less.
It was a lot of anger.
This is not in body.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was.
Everything I'd already lived.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now it's little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his eyes.
Several of you ...
Did you think?
No, I don't need it."
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
Turn off, comes this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
Put your cell phones on the floor ... (Laughter) Put your bags, the floor!
(Audience) Yes.
And then, behind you, close your computer.
You with the readers closed them, and you who were noticing their notebooks, closing their notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now...
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
For the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"No, I'll look at her in the face like this."
You're good, you got even a little kiss... (Laughter) Audience: "Well."
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where they are?
Do you see?
Do you see?
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Very closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TETO?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
And I said, "No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, as it's new.
Equality is new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence?
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become ...
These are self-knowledge technologies that are a habit in our lives.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Get more generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
The direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another autensity, silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk, who holds the first video, (Laughter) which is usually a good first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
Audience: Yes.
The walls are so serversive that the idea of translated from a demand of a region of fans and ideas.
who asked behind the missing for an hour shared with their friends, their colleagues, and their family.
In Brazil, translation work is fundamental, only 5% of people agree with the Turchical apartment of suns.
Five percent, or less, have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer traditions around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians?
translating to 116 languages.
And, almost always well in 6,000 translations made up until now.
But we are only translated, as we also transcribe the talks made in events, like these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world.
But, as for me, allowing hearing impairment, I can follow the content of the talks.
(Laughter) When the talk isn't given in English, my case wanted to read in Portuguese, first it is transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified for me, instead, and from English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
Initially, the TEDx with its own logope indicates: "The bond only as TED technology, entertainment, which is "e," we can translate as entertainment.
And, from leaving the stage, referring to each other, today, the talks approach an inferiority of issues that go from the event about political entertainment, businesses, benedorism, even literature.
We have, for example.
We talk, they come back to a few hours of chance.
Another passion, by testing what "disages" is this cognitive event.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
It's to translate, rethink and bring as a pride of talks in the environment to ten.
And they can be the "terrox" for these TEDx stones, or TVs are seen in short educational and accessible to have very small children.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a strict word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," but to be "trox" is inside.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember the translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my society, because I'm quite anxious.
Not only it was innocent, sometimes it's the day we hire, but half an hour and hour and hour per day, two or three hours went by, that happens to me in other translators.
(Laughter) Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here receiving.
Inspiring people, but why do I think my theme is precious, because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent?
(Laughter) In initiatives like this: "That's TEDx."
(Applause)
(Applause) Second, the philosopher is the microphone.
It opened itself the option of a man in life.
(Applause) (Cheers)
It gives light to oneself and become what is potentially, that I have no doubts about education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt that education is fundamental for people, except that I'm legacted, with few crimes, the excluded to our society.
They can insert themselves in a dignity way in our society.
And when it's a volunteer work, I think it's the donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge.
If you help an object ...
Just because I'm a volunteer work, because being my choice, my decision.
I have to do the best way possible and I have to commit myself.
To give the time that's left is different to keep the pieces, the remains of our time, tradition, complex activity, that demands not only to know the same foreign, the source fight, but mainly.
Our language.
Men Fongos, who is a young destiny, because of a very extinct translation, there's always a huge knowledge.
Many research, many work, many hours of dedication.
And for us, a fluent translation to be ours of kiss, there's always a shadow that I'm distressed.
And frustrated with what?
As small as you do, he can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost infinitely.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations, not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who will watch, right?
And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transitions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally took advantage of a cordiner's motto or a language coordinator.
Or, as we call it, by an EdC.
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, that we offered Portuguese, which is very different.
We have ten elites, which I would like to cite here nominations.
I read stories, we have Helena, we have Maricene.
Claudia, and me?
My boy and I, who are confined, my boy, liked the tunnel or the uncle and Rafael.
(Sigh)
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
Very well, this obsession I have with education, in half, has to do, not only with Brazil, that lives in a deep political crisis, nor that education is released at five of the bread, but without seeing my own personal history.
(Laughter) My father, who would have been two years now if he was coming, mistreated primary school.
Nevertheless, I knew this baby very well and did the four characteristics very well, and his dream was always being able to study beyond because I had studied.
And to make the children study, that's why homosexual people who lived in our neighbor called "Tai obedies."
It was decided to change for her four kids at the time, I paid very strange: the biggest city than we, girls.
And, on some side, my father had sold his start, his Uberas shop, and his place.
They also knew, as a businessman, they had a small hotel from a presence store they had replaced before.
(Laughter) However, in 1964, against a great reession in Brazil, due to this reession and other reasons, my father went to Valencia and lost absolutely everything, he stayed, literally, without anything, that you kill in his nine seeds.
(Cheers) Many of them felt very humiliated by their economic plague, my father decided after paying his teeth, if he changed for the blessers like mom in front of me, to go back, to eat well the deduce.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who is now 90 years old, isn't Arizona, besides being an astero of Jogos Parágua yet today.
It was an excedent film, a conclusion of higher training, my bug, and she decided to sell markets.
So, for so many years, at home, the pair of queijo was literally gaining a poop, saying a ticket in the best pains of queijo by the horizon.
(Audience) Yes!
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
Audience: Yes.
And that's how it was done: a big done, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penetration of national research by love and households.
In the 48-year-old crossing, in Brazil's 60s?
Only 32% of people with greater solidarity than me, yes, fundamental.
And this obsession, this step, this passion my father arrives to education ...
Transparentia?
In the smaller days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself.
At the time, when I was seven, we were already alphabetized at 100 years old.
And a provocator who think of a notebook and said to the producer, "No, a doctor arrives to him and to any visitor who appears at home."
(Laughter) So, I'm entering, switching through words, you can imagine.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalisas de Parkia," right?
But for my father, they would check their babies, without knowing, they had to train a little for this talk here, anyway.
My five siblings were able to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children when our dreams were better than that, right?
And here I say, to me, the greatest passion in my program's life, are my two children: Danieel, the young Henrique.
Which I never put it as the chair to have a newspaper for me?
But for those I questioned all nights, their stories before sleeping.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincident that, coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is being an accident.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is reeducating this business, for me, fantastic, creative, diverse, revolutionary, that it applies in students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
(Applause) In education and obsession, we have to be "men separated from education."
Despite the living conditions, despite developing our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx, just as my father was such a simple way, inspired us, just as today I was inspired by these wonderful speakers.
TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
They make us believe that, despite everything -
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with her armile, an alphabet where she can feel the things that are written.
AC: During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it's super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked, a few classes, and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
I ended up touching my notebook and ended up memorizing the alphabet and I did many times, and I left buying a ticket, which is a small one that allows you to describe in Braille, on the street you write that shows the relief.
And my agenda?
I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threw me with music letters.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, it still gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the schedule.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and it only shaved in nothing, we reescribed everything, disconnected and reconnected everything, and it started to work, and about a month ago, we ended the clock and showed the hours and minutes in Braille to try to do a report in Braille, it was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that something that was born from an interest can help with their aunt's inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
(Applause) So we'd like to show a video that our aunt, besides the schedule of the clock, the senses, the sounds, and leave the message that many things seem quite simple, they weren't yet created, and, even if we, two high school students, who didn't finish ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask a question.
What do you think?
There are harmful people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
(Applause) You can put your hand in the air.
Audience: Yes.
Okay, we're all short: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
This is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference, with sexual relations that dance commercially.
It's that it's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has sex relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
There are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their advertisers, receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about this that I've come to talk about and not about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us from 16 or adults that didn't make sense that consent is crime cases, are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults that is forced, which is consistent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, always, stilherent by forgotten volunteer and forced prostitution.
It doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action, but to take all the people who do situation, because of traffic victims, sexual exploitation, it's to confuse.
A small part, as if it were the whole.
Research has shown that, in Portugal, the traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
To give you an idea of what I just said, which Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and which, regarding the year of 2016, are the latest available data, indicates that in Portugal were confirmed 118 traffic victims.
Humanity.
Almost all of us for job exploitation, victims for sexual harassment.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There is an image in a very historical way of preservation to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
Defense.
Sured that they are waiting for someone to save well.
But this doesn't respond to reality either, or it's just another stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, we know that there is a diversity of buildings that influences the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they tell me is that this was an option.
It's an option based, later related to advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly witnesses a disorder, and it's not recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think what is the image you see immediately?
(Laughter) The mind, when you think of a person that prostitates.
Think about it.
OK, and I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any other one.
Or, a woman from Malaspeto and minister who is in a corner, in a dark street in the city.
And it's very likely a dry touch of a relative and, of course, there's someone exploring it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
(Laughter) They're not just women.
Oh, they're not just women on the street.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many transgents of sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Of someone on the street, I tell you that the studies that are the distance of being made.
And the accidental cities.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
Complete or place.
Because it will only represent people around 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they're less, they're minor, but they're not negligible.
I'll give you the studies of the study, which was done here in Portugal, which had a great sex worker friend, was a study led by the Spanish teacher at Lisboa University, and who interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of the inside, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10 addictions to 2% of men.
And now, 7.8 percent of trans women and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even more high.
In sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the medicine.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden?
From 1999.
It's not prohibited to sell sex, but it's a crime to buy sex.
The idea that is based on this law is that people who are in abstraction are victims without exception, and thus we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
(Laughter) But there have been very strong evidence, namely, the organizations of non-dignmental ones that work every day, with people who talk about sexual abuse, and indicate that this law puts higher risk their own sex tastes and increases their sustainability to violence.
It's the stigma and the disease.
Audience: Yes.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
(Laughter) They are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
For an idea that I think ideologically biased, even because research has proved that relationships between...
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, and that are mainly not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of cooking the customers is unfortunate.
Because they're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities ...
Without right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can attend sex professionals.
There are even countries with a cool role, a sexual assistant, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual donations with people who are disabled people, and now who destroy any argument that try to be the favor of the customers' criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done yourself."
Control to work connections if this can be done without more explanation than in another job activity, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically sexual moral, which divides sexuality into two types to the side having a sexuality and considered legitimate.
"Normal and natural" And, on the other hand, we have a "sexo-Fordae" considered illegitimate, "anormal" and anti-natural and there you have sex commerce.
And the fact that this sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and natural, is based on stigmatization, of decreidibilization of people who do this activity, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many discrimination about sex workers, like, for example.
When he runs into institutions in the health area, justice, and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way, now, a little bit, that I don't know if someone used this word, not TEDxBas, the stigma of puta ...
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
And the worst offense that we can drive a woman calls her puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and honor, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and this one behaves bad.
And in this sense?
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of the control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of deplex mirror that's above the head of any of us, any woman knows if there's a sexual behavior, that is socially unveiled, is at risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
So, what do I think we can do any of them, can we do so that they don't keep on disrespecting sex-respectors?
And I think that the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And I too.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge the stigma, but I'm here to do right now and give voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time, sex callers are everywhere organized and we use "if they have credibility," they're not heard, they haven't been told, we don't want compassion or tolerance crimes, we want rights, and that's what I think the path we have to follow.
Audience: Yes.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we should keep disrespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex wisdom.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Art, well cure, art, cure from being a doctor.
It was the idea supported by a fundamental letter.
In the patient's medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to spiritually engage, otherwise the way I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have there, father, has to beat.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment, and so that I can propose it?
The best treatment for that divine.
This balance is very delicate.
And the human relationship of our time, with all the superficial and most rawest, so the balance is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips that I followed many doctors, they were also there.
It's different to see.
When we got there, in our advance of ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
Bantilular, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have since I had no childhood.
To relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that love, that service there.
He used to park.
The ones that call it, the request for call, schedule, schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and talk about it.
And Rouquis.
It was the path I found with which we brought to our daily practice, that the simplification that runs can be replicated here too, is the very small research on the stage that we bring to go to the middle of the Amazon that I discovered.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, yes.
If you make a list of topics of students' goals, the first goals are there.
Is it altruism?
We're even good.
These same students, with the same research, in the symbol of the Medical Court.
But success's assignment is knowledge.
Cure.
When did we do it wrong?
If we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic stomach, and we handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but they don't know anything about us.
(Applause)
The worry about the average relationship with the patient, with medicine, comes back from the past.
In Greece, the fish in medicine, where the father, the medicine, who is poor, doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When the lemon cracked the apple, the "eva desengae" and that was to make a leg trip, that's what we do until today, it didn't touch the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and little your father in medicine because for the first time?
We must have a method there.
It can transform the art of healing something that can be taught, learned, retrodessed, replicated.
And in such a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and created an isolation of pedocrimes.
And even today it's used in medicine forms, around the world, a fifth century before Christ, I'm from a photo.
These are slightly complex words, and I prepared three partners here.
In all the houses I entered, I just said to see the exercise of the patients, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and duties.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
If I respect this jury and not violate it, it would be the right to go for a reputation between men and all times.
And if I bring the violin, what happens to me the opposite?
Why, at that time, was you worried about this, and you still do a dinner?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to be thrilled, because the prepacient medical relationship is impressible for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken for honor judgment.
And, in this case, I'm honored to participate in a position that is registered for a man's judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, medical knowledge proliferated in such a way that an individual is no longer capable of absorbing all knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of having a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit.
With this, we'll specialize in healing this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in class in college, in class with small groups, like teachers.
I played with Spanish processes, patients with aography, resonance, and how they copy our illustration.
I'll look for their hand in their belly after their awareness.
"Oh, I'm not less with posture too."
Each called me a bit, called my class and said, "Let's see the patient's belly."
He looked at his auntie, in his patient's finger, who doubted what was smoking in front of him, and didn't smoke anymore, a hole of five, and showed him that he had emagreced.
Like those in your skin, cloud and dose, you can see if it's able to take care of your own clothes, the dirty blind can say a lot, when you're putting yourself in a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that they can remember something that didn't tell you in your doctor, and said, "If all this didn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing patients.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move on it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, to be mixed up in black people, to be good, he who you're asking for permission, stop taking care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap and are appeared, improved faster and have a shorter nickname, our environment, the same employees, a house where we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no amsterian change, no rays, diseases like this.
As I said, what happens is that our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and said, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the patient's condition, but to be a drug dealer, I'm patient and be passive for those who are talking to me."
Anyone you'll tell this to a group of mind because, after all, the active act of the relationship are not doctors.
Audience: Yes.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
And there are doctors against patients.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive, and we're patient, passive, and we have to hold our hands, that it's in our cure process.
And it's not only going to look for healthy life, but also to engage in the process of healing, in decisions for the healing process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
Where did the owner talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had many copies of the size in my house, medicine and health, had a book free of health, and that didn't exist without giving up?
The difference is that, at that time, to meet someone, publish something, because it's a editor. You had to have content to talk, today, with Google, you have information insinity, many very good and important fabrics, but many very bad storms.
And we need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information, it's greater than the filtrate capacity.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see the information first.
Information, today, usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people join my curriculum, but you see who I am.
This gives me a huge call, because people enter there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they know they don't have me for anything, this because it put me, because just like other people who are defending personal interests, winners, I had a high-clock or other things.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: don't believe in good things, the windows, look, medicine changed, now their problems usually ended.
Differently a lab, a scientist, will have a relevant and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one is on its own, so there's nothing you discovered today, tomorrow it's on the Internet and my doctor, when I don't know: trouble.
Third, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry doesn't interest you to know this, to be fools, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly some other interest and exclusion behind, so, these things of my partner is that we don't believe.
For a long time.
Any information, discuss to your doctor, it's there for that.
Information is not the same as knowledge, information is knowledge, takes information, participate in their cure, but rebuilt the average cost.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura.
It's to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, the public hospital has no time to attend me, I work 20 years in October."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think that's going to change the day to night, when I have to have the culture to change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in my body, it's not that, it's crazy to know.
There is: if we compost time, we'll make atendments different.
Doctors want, they don't want to have this attempt, but not an hour, they want to serve the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, the area was mom.
And we had a patient there, he had sneakers cancer.
It's a bit humorous.
Thank you very much.
And there was no speechologist with us, and we, from bringing him to São Paulo, was treated here in the future of cancer.
Hi.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his trip, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German.
He had a translator, he was the neighbor's son who spoke very little about Portuguese, and he was very bad.
He was obviously furniture.
And I presented a consultation.
And, for me, you'd give us a scene from a movie.
The index looked at the doctor.
This is what it needs.
Isn't it?
The doctor was, "Dad.
It's not easy, OK?
(Laughter) What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual of that?
Without setting the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, who had all the interest in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art to heal.
So, it doesn't need much importance, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors taking care of teachers who are anonymous, very few, in ambulants who consult.
Doing.
One.
Culting the soul, a fight.
Excuse me, paying attention.
So, do we, gasics?
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
More compassion.
All patients.
The active pleasure in your cure process.
This makes me have a connection.
You look at the world, but there's better, and you'll be more invented, difficult thing.
Thank you very much.
