CONEL is our Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
I'd say that.
That the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way I treat their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
And we're living a paradox.
And our children are what we have the most precious.
We want them.
their well-being is any course.
We'll give our lives for it.
And yet?
Our children are getting very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes.
And I want to do a little with you today.
What if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, who are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights such as health, housing, education, food.
We treat violence.
What if they rebel?
What are we?
And we offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
And we'll get it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Let's start with your pregnancy, to see how to understand.
These seas.
Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
So, she starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing.
And that produces Caii culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible.
It's harmful, dangerous, painful, that generates a shameful statistics in our country: 93% of birth in the private network, for example, Rio de Janeiro, 93% are made by crazedy.
According to 15 to 20% of parents develop.
And this generates enormous benefits for children, that makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical acute to a adopted doctor.
Inmobilized, of course, it can be humanized, and it can be done well, but certainly it won't have the same benefits as normal impact.
And remembering that, of course, there are necessary cablets for each one of these sines that we'll be.
And we are criticizing is exaggeration, unnecessary, what is lying.
The same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists that can be there.
Working, it's going to tell the age: you can take a mammal here, a small formula of milk in poop, the case of her, needed, and she's hungry.
She goes home more insecure, she arrives home.
Her grandmother, her mother, used to say, "You grew up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, you're outside?"
The child is crying, the tolerator is thin, in two months this child is in a nursery, and she loses the wonders that the mother milk can offer.
This comes a big part of the industry house.
The industry is prohibited to spread the advertisement to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms, they awake.
Have you experienced it?
Aprime.
And breast milk is money, it's entered, it's breastfeeding.
But he came with a lot of love.
And it's infinitely superior to any of these forms.
And more.
industries advertise directly to the doctor, they do their marriage doctor.
Connecting in your own ...
And that sponsoring with a lot of prizes and dinneries and congresses and sponsoring entirely the medical societies, conquering the sympathy of the pediatric, that end up unconsciously.
It's one of the largest homes in Brazil.
And this way we're losing.
The privileges of breastfeeding and searching through the first sin, which is the privation of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
Mine opened it, where?
Your mother's license will end, she'll have to go to the bucket because the cotton can't take care of it.
And it will pass on sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours.
In an institution, but getting home these parents are tired of fatigue, in a long day of work, in bottles, and they will live very little with their daughter.
There's still work to do at home, on weekends, and they'll take babies, nurses of erra babies, because, after all, how many people are of iron.
And what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood: convince our children.
We regret building the adolescence of this.
And the child loses his contact with the most important people in his life.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this.
Because of exterrible, the sin of childhood's personalization.
Gabriela's parents can't cook, don't have time.
And there's no money to pay the employee, they'll give what the media tells us to give frozen food, industrialized food.
What do supermarkets show their brilliant Brazilians?
And they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy.
Because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar excess.
Black people out there, lines inside, all the weapons that the industry, through food engineering, highly developed.
What does so that children can be completely addicted to industrialised food and in this way unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're tea.
I said, "What? What?"
And this brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploded in childhood.
And even if we want to provide food, that we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, because it's given agro toxic data, we're world champions of agro toxic consumption.
This is the sin.
From the intoxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and someone knows that highly negative of the involvements of a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
And I said, "So?
But our children ...
Our urban life doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, to stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they enlighten me, and don't want everyone to get in touch.
So these children spend eight, guys, being a statistic.
Eight to ten hours connected to their devices today: Again, connecting with the play device is great, but not eight hours later.
Children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're constantly distracted, and this is getting worse, I remember that when I traveled the car, my children, we played, it was an incredible moment.
And we played "Dedanha," we played "Dedanha," who played "Dedanha," here, the country chose well.
We used to play team games, but at the moment of family relief, of a laughing humour, of things that stay in our memory of us in childhood.
We looked at the window, we saw landscape passing in the form of meditation.
(Laughter) However, today it's two duties and two states for each one, if it can't do anything in the car.
And even in moments, that exists, guys.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child most needs that exists, this comes from there, but you can say, "Ip√≥rico," "Ipote."
(Laughter) That's the name, porn.
It still comes with a layer to cover the tablet, you'll look at the shell, right?
(Laughter) Even in moments when she needs awareness the most, that's what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction.
And this makes us confin our children.
And preventing them to have moments of consciousness, of void.
TED is fundamental in childhood.
Because TED and void are bercers of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination, and we are amputing this from our children.
A sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
Gabriela watches four hours of TV per day, she is massacrated by advertising.
She's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school, at maximum four hours and spend more time on television.
Americans remember us and we work them because we have less time in school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the store.
The family makes the classic show of the Brazilian family today has week, which is "U."
Very well.
Where it'll be more massacrated by advertising, by consumerism values, and this advertising is coherent obesity, it's a profession that explodes its ability, to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
What explodes her love by characters, doing what she ...
They fall in love with toxic products, for expensive toys and brands, for inclusion of love.
And that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
utility in worse things.
And what will it be like?
In obesity, even in glass consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, not people, advertisement is totally liberated.
And I always confuse friendship behind them, it's obviously the one who needs the most friendship are teenagers and they are deeply affected by beer commercials.
And welcoming, adolescence, is growing scary, this is the sin in the mercantilization of childhood and of child consumption.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
(Laughter) But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, a wonderful language: Who hasn't hurt me at the ball?
Look at the sky, look at the floor, look at the sky.
There's no better meditation than that.
I said, "Let's spend money with another class," and then she'll be exposed to that.
To the type of erotization, our society proposes, "Merodization!
What do you use seven or eight-year-old kids to sell products?
It's fashion, generalization, which is based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women.
In the excessive value of the appearance, and worse, in the disociation of sexuality.
Love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erodization, and this affects children directly, deforming their mind when they're eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and eroticism for which?
I said, "Gabriel!"
There's peace that's afraid of her, because they don't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put them in a tribe, it becomes the queen of the family, and not the member of the family anymore, it starts deciding the programs, the cardboard.
If it goes bad at school, school's guilt, we have to go talk to the teacher.
She gathers a lot of gifts because when she needed, you see the present.
She realized that she is more and more than her parents have no authority: a child.
Sometimes, with two or three years old, they thought that parents don't have authority, they're a little evil, they're insecure, they need people who lead their lives.
This generates anxiety and generates symptoms.
We know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability, instead of that, we're doing what the Americans call "h√©licopter Pinting."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world.
They don't have life experience, so they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, and certainly the world will give them later, this is the sin.
from the intronization and the superpower of childhood.
I said, "Well.
And, facing so many problems, of course, childhood will give five rounds, right?
The child will become rebelled, fights, sneakers, get sick, eat too much, become obese, goes bad at school, don't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it.
And it's not possible for these children in this way.
In the same way we take these children?
The poor people put in jail.
So, why do I love it?
The solution we're going to give to bad behavior children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think.
This context, no, medicalization: we'll give them medicine, black afternoon for them to behave well.
This is called medicalization and it's the worst of a sin.
The quino de Mafalda says this: "Rettable is a wonderful way, of how many stories of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people passing bad because of the paper.
And they go to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy.
And what does not show us here, actually?
What is the factory producing?
Exactly the medicine.
And I said, "No.
And that's what we're doing with our children, not only with educational children, adults also, in a terragoned way.
Medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are as big as black, with this individualist competitive society, right?
The three employees are the market that grows the most; before depressive.
So, we got to this point.
And Ritalina, such as medicine, which is for the disorder of attention and imperativity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This is not a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood.
We're rotating, "normalizing," and preventing children to be themselves, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses in humanity had today in school.
It would be exactly this: rooted or not martized, and we would have sympathetic his genius and we would have lost that wonderful thing we had of bringing.
So we can see that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths.
And problems are very complex, I don't see, without a sin and factors that self-alimentate each other.
It's for all the problem, the complex of humanity.
The philosopher said, "There's always a solution."
Simple.
Easy.
It's invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
That's what we think about it.
The solution is a very old TEDx; I'm already going through, and I'll spend my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time.
And space, but no.
In relation to time?
What can we do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today?
The meaning is to pay for this in almost all churches.
The d√©cima is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, who are our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays?
Our capital.
It's more important, it's time.
The time?
We have 17 hours of age.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40, a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just prioritizing, and if it doesn't happen in the days of the week, we start with one at the weekend, it's possible to give time to live together.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds.
Let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I have confidence.
Close your eyes for 15 seconds.
I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health and quality of life, they wouldn't have a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
I'm sure it's the greatest one of you.
And this demonstrates a little the importance of nature, nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul.
We know what makes us healthy.
It's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, it's all these factors, we know this.
What we don't know, and had an interesting experience.
I started with Patricia, who back then, who wasn't giving me a presentation, and she said, "Wow, but did you talk about an amazing thing?"
Because I talked about convergence, health and sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment, everything that causes health does well the environment and vice versa.
To ride a bike makes the body good, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transportation does well for the invitation time, reduces the pollution, eat the organic, does the body well, does it well for the earth, see the animals.
Things always go around in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce consumption of excessive material, he'll promote the book which, at the same time, will generate intelligence, humour, imagination, creativity.
And it will generate conviviality between families, love life, and it will generate conviviality between children, different children who will learn to know each other and learn to deal with them.
Let's develop empathy, let's promote contact with the air, just, and the green that produces well being physic, well being psychic, mental.
And it will reduce all childhood problems, this is scientific, I don't know what I'm talking about, it's the studies that show it is.
It reduces obesity, aggressiveness, joy, exclusion, improves immunity, improves socialization and schooling, in a wonderful way, bringing children to nature.
And when I talk about bringing children into nature, we're not talking.
From condemnical spaces with "gourmir" steps, look, now there'll be a "grin" space, no, we're talking about domination.
We're talking about jumping the wall and embracing the city.
And play in the squares.
Play public spaces, with games, with love, with affection, with guest.
And there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this.
And not only the initiative to use physics, but also by claiming public policies.
What facilitates us with public space, with nature.
They don't wait, promote the cycle.
free stories of these spaces, neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Impossible forces are very careful.
All of this is called occupation of a city, and the word occupies, practically used for resistance and citizens today, it means to occupy public spaces with joy.
Audience: And ...
Mainly participate in the city governance, the city governance is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as happened in S√£o Paulo.
As you can see here, it's a photo of the company "Birens," a source of water from S√£o Paulo for 30 to 40 years, and today, from the mago-vernance.
And cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas related to public interest, sustainability, and equity.
And with transparency and paying bills.
And there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this.
It's even who matters happy.
And it's cool for us to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming here, will come very early; our children will get me.
They also say that 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis.
Reducing inequality from the social point of view.
And from the environmental point of view, of course, doing everything we already know, right?
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
and taking kids outside.
Take the kids to the park, to Egora?
For this invitation, for empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold cachorr, not seeing YouTube, we learn more about this boxwel and defend them in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children already outside.
The family is already out there.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces with the game, with play.
With entertainment, with part of this patient.
That's it, and how we're talking about utopia, isn't it?
I spread myself showing the gallery side that left us -
Unfortunately, this year?
He said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he goes away, if he approaches me a thousand steps, he pushes one thousand steps.
So, what is utopia good for?
Exactly to not make us walk.
What does it make us walk outside.
AC: In 2007.
And I came across a great group of young people and adults.
CF: With difficulties.
Explusted from regular school.
And Egyptor?
What's my biggest challenge?
It was to look and see.
AC: The many efficiency of these people.
They are affected by their disabilities.
So I created the project Caf√©therapy.
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a truly inclusive society?
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion.
Within the school.
With their parents.
With their children and partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they presented this.
For the parents.
Pommunity.
It's for society in general.
People with disabilities -
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
So stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
VR: To have friendship.
It has to act with people.
For example, the case of student Igor.
And what did he study at the other school?
For four years, he didn't enter the classroom.
Because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't have the strength either.
So, over four years.
And he stayed in the court.
Participating in all physical education lessons.
And since he loved running.
He was running all the time.
AC: Cheging isn't a clean field.
I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do.
What's his interest at school?
And what together could we do?
so that he could.
They improved the best learning.
The school?
For me, it was a place.
of despair.
AC: Isn't it a pump?
And today he's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe it's school.
It goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
A healing.
Learning, learning.
The schools think.
They are not able to treat these students.
And what are they not prepared to receive?
But schools need to overcome this difficulty.
He needed to use it.
And I believed.
AC: And they are capable.
"What is this child's story?"
AC: In the school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do well to other students.
For the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned.
Then to see the possibilities.
From the learning of others.
Why is school like this?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned.
Valorize my look.
To survive with people.
So, they can see it.
And I learn.
You can know.
My hearing?
surviving with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
Or those who have many times.
AC: It has difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
And what's most important that I learned?
It was valued my heart.
And the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
It's learning.
I said, "The exercise."
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
AC: Good morning.
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been a kitchen.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
To cook, right?
I was going to cook, work in the kitchen, and she'd take account of Christmas seeds, in the new house, P√°scoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer.
I want to give you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world.
It changed my diet.
And with it, I realized that food had.
You can say it like that.
I also decided to study food philosophies that could use food as a prevention, cure and treatment of diseases.
What kind of medication monthly?
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobi√≥tic."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system.
Through food.
"Yes."
I believe that...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
The detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Succated is a little ...
From life.
It's rural for the city, we can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can run connected.
With nature.
AS: And ...
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking.
I fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It was to succeed.
It's to reestructure the food system.
Change.
The food dynamic.
The production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example.
There are two principles that lead.
The meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed.
How much more you produce?
The cheaper.
It's produced.
Worst is quality.
And what?
It's greater for the environment and for our health in terms of speed.
The animal's cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, is artificially accelerated.
He loses, he begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies...
That's it.
I arrive an hour that is not right.
And he begins to lose, decrease drastically.
Your quality of life, your health and your life time.
So I believe we can and must change this food system, I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized.
(Laughter) That the freezer's kilo was more...
The fact is that the kilo of tomato is saying, "Guys, how can you?
This is very complex, right?
How can it cost so little?
You can create an animal from birth to abate.
And that didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process, right?
In the industrial scale, it's also a lot.
We say it so harmful for our lives, for our health, and for the environment, why?
Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers in the world, each Brazilian consumes around 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's one ...
It's an exorbitant amount.
And I believe people.
(Laughter) They know the agricultural benefits, but even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society ...
It has the values.
Invertising: there is an investment of values.
Why does a person worry?
And don't buy a failed perfume because they think there'll be some alertical reaction because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what chemistry there is inside.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
Why?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover this change of values, and we need to teach people.
"Ah! I don't know
Valorize organic products because when you buy, for example, a pack of highways.
It's not an organic coch, you're paying, not only you're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
Because it's something people can't do: investing, many times, they don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of all affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why ...
I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food.
A third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
And in terms of consumption, the way we consume food today is frightening: my grandmother is Pulista, she lives in S√£o Paulo.
What if I took her, put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue?
I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Really.
those executives or those depressed people.
Walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because cigaring is something that people think is a waste of time, but actually.
It's very important, so she'd have almost a fivepe, but because it doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding yourself.
And it's ...
And then?
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this, so we can eat.
Together with another activity, or talking on the cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we end up opening space to the street, which is really cool.
This is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of Salvador and sugar which are the three, is trufficious, right?
And these, mainly, the tasks of flavors.
They end up destroying our paladar.
They degenerated our nervous system.
And they end up creating a dependency that doesn't suffer physics.
But a mental dependence, a psychological dependency.
A physiological dependency, that is, industrialized products in excess is very harmful, I don't even call them food, for me they're made of food, because you can even consume and satisfy it, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panick?
Hyptoca of panel instead of micron.
from microwaves:
Made, half.
And who's still a cake?
Instead of buying that little bag with a package.
MMS: Well, too, half of the half.
And the question ...
(Laughter) It might seem that these two questions may seem a little harmful, not to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange panick for the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health because you'll be consuming.
They are chemical that you wouldn't put, I'm sure you're absolute in your panick.
And you're also polluting with packaging.
So I think that excessive consumption of industrialized products is very big.
Initial month.
So, it's ...
for us to speak.
"Yes ...
To summarize?
This is the question.
The production process of food, I think...
It's a lot of this dynamic to feed this allies system.
It's not sweet, it's not.
If it's not working and we must change, but how to change?
Right?
The main answer is returning to fire.
Think about it.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Cozinharing brings independence, brings high self-awareness, gives autonomy.
Bring safety, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry.
And it's because they don't cook, it's industrial doesn't cook, simply food processes.
So, if you let it?
The industry feeds you.
She will choose for you what you'll have for Jo√£o.
Black, frozen...
Bats, hamburgers, dry dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we are ...
No, man.
Where is the rice and the bean, where is the bean rice cada day?
That filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are many people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think.
That making food is very worky, it's anti-pathetic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean from night to day, wake up in the morning.
And in 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
to be frozen for the rest of the week.
Sunding with a street, fresh who you do in 20 to 30 minutes.
More the vegetables you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, in half an hour you have.
The ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
To wait or the peelor of Pelotas.
Right?
So ...
I believe we must change.
The way we see the kitchen, as we see the kitchen act.
Everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
boy, girl, child, adult, and elderly.
AC: There's no...
And gravity doesn't have sex.
Sex doesn't have gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education.
We teach children.
taking children to the fair to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner.
It's putting children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can.
It's to build a better future, these children will grow.
With a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think it's from the supermarket shelter.
So ...
We're good children.
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the industry.
It's pharmaceutical because they'll be much less sick.
growing up eating cash food, healthy food.
And I believe we have to ...
And changing?
The dynamic.
In food, we have to change our AI.
Our value.
Profess...
What we have with food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thanks to license, education.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Right?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
This has fewer hospitals, this is education.
Is it education and prevention?
The future of food.
And it will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose.
Well, food.
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
What are we going to live?
What do we do?
And how do you wake up?
It works.
To talk about the power of transforming stories?
It's about passing through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I'd come back as a child.
My holidays, my cousins, my brothers.
And also for family parties.
My torment, Mario G√ºeyus?
It was the first planter of recycling machine companies in Brazil.
Here in the "tch√°" lands.
For me, and then, he got married with my old grandmother.
And they had seven children inside my mother.
Who happened to my father?
And after having had my five siblings.
And I arrived in this world.
By the way,
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell.
that make us be who we are and when we contain them, we transform ourselves and those who listen.
It also transforms itself.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
MA: But...
And we are our story.
Before looking at this future ...
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early.
I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to experience mourning.
And I know that he helped a lot of people too.
So having told this, having told this story?
For me, it brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
That is the power that people can feel welcomed in the story of others.
They feel the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously I'm someone.
Go!
She sees and will sit on her face and feel welcomed.
But then one day came.
Because I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
It's a product.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change.
That I needed to expand, and so I went.
"Ah! I don't know
Help people to tell their stories, because the publicity world had been very small.
(Laughter) So I started to do this, "What about one of them?
Stories that I want to share with you are Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk.
Two years ago, she's bringing TEDx.
AS: Overview.
entrepreneurship with purpose.
Something so fashionable nowadays, but he brought me another challenge.
That she talks about bullying, because that's what he've always suffered.
And he wanted to share the story with others.
And I left because I had to do with the subject.
Except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about it?
He always came with a lot of badness, and always a lot of complaint.
It was a right.
Especially what they had done with it.
But what's the goal of telling a story, to be to keep complaining about who did that with us?
What if not, to inspire people?
AG: They can welcome themselves and take responsibility of who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who understood this, started changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and speaking for the first time he was gay.
Absolutely.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
And I like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
And also to have seen that the roof they imagined, that Tiago had.
It was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better and he welcomed himself.
And just as he welcomed, I'll tell his story.
A lot of people.
If he welcomes me in his story, the last week, he sent me.
A big saying.
That many boys have been looking for it even more.
He said, "There's no.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
to tell him that he had felt.
Next to his story.
who wanted to share the problems they had on their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told us that.
His story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way.
That I had no shame at all.
So, tell stories to me.
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm training many people to be here in this place.
AC: But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, easy a question.
Atea!
I said, "Oh!
I tell you something funny, it shows your children's pictures, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important, and, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big regae.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not by the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, √°vio, the professor of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we stayed for months.
Preparating his speech at TEDx Lossador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
AC: Two weeks before.
It's his speech.
I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong."
Every time you tell me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head, how much in fact.
You have to get out of here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk.
Open your listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was listened to when he needed it most, when people suicide when he had cancer.
What did he do?
What about him?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always very busy.
In wanting to learn how to speak.
How to tell?
There are so many courses of equation, oratory, writing, but who is worried about learning?
And how to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves and we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we'll change.
So we talk about change.
AG: There's always this fear.
And, like this moment, we always arrive and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And for the eyes.
And the listening ...
AC: You see, also, before that famous word "empathy."
Do we talk so much about empathy?
But we don't have one minute to look at each other, to come embrace and say.
Some things.
We don't have time.
Other people.
Why are we worried?
With our own, I saw.
We always have a priority.
So?
AC: How can we talk about my empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
AC: This, after hearing his talk, got back.
NJ: Great.
Audience: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more ...
100 people, more than 400 stories of the most various ones I heard.
It holds out all the others.
That empathy too, I learned collectivity.
When she taught me...
Why?
AC: We need to look yes to the problem of homeless people, for example, is that when we say on the street...
And many of us have nothing to give.
And when do they ask us something?
We have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and tell, that make us be who we are.
And by listening, the other really.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
I said, "Listen and quote."
So, he also transforms himself.
And in the midst of preparation a fight, which was this process here for me, was outside my army.
I suffered a lot to be here today, teaching something, caring, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me?
AC: And for everything?
I gave a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'm going to read, I want to free.
AC: Many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her life.
From the 4th of the flaws, the salts of the ...
VR: Two values of the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
to give them faith in life.
Faith.
In some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know.
AG: Of being that they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
The freedom of your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
GL: Really Libertated.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
AC: And you, what stories will you tell about your life?
Stories, you want you to talk about you.
Audience: Thank you.
There's here on Earth to be told to me.
What I don't belong to many spaces.
It's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and-passion.
Or you'll say, "There's a judgment?"
Where there are all types of stars.
And the stars don't have labels or classifications.
They are only part of their explored spaces.
And there's no fat or thin, ugly.
Remember the poor.
It's just a legacy of existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while.
During a very obscure phase that reflected on my life.
A phase where I was denied the right of being just one.
That's it.
Resisting and existing has always been a life condition.
From the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
A woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her when she was born.
I don't look for acceptance.
But it does respect.
And the right for life.
That's exactly why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and Stargian in the sky, the universe is infinite.
And, together, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, no one was covered or the beauty of the other.
So why are we here below?
So tiny, we couldn't reproduce something so simple.
What is acceptance?
I'm empathy.
And to definitely understand that the different one agrees.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
So that's why we have privilege.
And it's the opportunity to be different.
The different one is B.
It's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives.
And this is rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you.
Permit yourself.
Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process?
For me, the bathroom was a dedicated ball.
It was where I could be the same.
It was where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
But the question is.
What was in the bathroom that didn't have in the other places and that was denied to me?
MMS: Or better, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different.
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it comes to the trans universe, this path is even more difficult.
I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me.
I didn't even know what trans people were.
And for my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me, I said, "Guys, I want to turn trans too."
And everyone coming.
And, for then, she thought about starting in the wrong way.
I wanted to mirror myself to the other.
So, during my graduation in Artescenica, I had the opportunity to meet myself, from inside.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life.
It was in theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in the theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my true essence and started my blossom.
It's as if you enter a cockle, spend some time there and leave a beautiful ballot.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everyone is there to deal with it.
It's very difficult when you're in the middle of a mixture of transformations.
And you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others.
There's a lot of empathy in this world.
And if you are a woman, black, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily.
The case for us is weird, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people.
It doesn't happen.
So, she questions itself.
"But come here.
Are you transmediate, our new thing, don't you have traffic faces?
I said, "No.
I'm doing it."
AC: People.
Who are aware, chooses, who is the life expectancy of 35 years?
It's a magnifying glass here who wants to see it like this.
As a white man has his life expectancy, of 76.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills trans people?
The whole world.
And I wouldn't choose.
They question this and question about veracity.
For example.
According to the National Association of Women Transvestis.
I said that today, trans women in Brazil, we have 14 times.
To die of being murdered, more than a man exiggered.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016.
Thanks, 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
And being a trans, it's not good.
But in a living condition.
There's no magic formula, there's no strength, no strength, resistance, 35-year expectation, there aren't the ones that weren't like that, that we could better measure this panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story.
However, each one of us is the protagonist of their own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
It only depends on us.
For example, I'm the living proof of this, after finally meeting myself who I was, after I finally discovered my essence.
I started to use it.
"Yes."
My friend ...
My art as a way of deconstructing ideas, preestablished about me.
I wanted to enter YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people.
Not only transsexual people.
I saw myself lecturing about a life experience for many people.
I saw myself being a model, magazine layer, "J" and "perform" and "outuber," and no pencil has my career.
I was invited to live a strange character.
In an immensory where this novel exhibited for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's a responsibility.
That's not it.
The reality is very big to talk about differences.
A lot of people.
To represent a flag.
And you went to all that I represent, together with everything.
"But that's it, I did it."
abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
Even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, talk about it.
who were filled with comments, "How a man, capable, monster, you'll never be a woman."
Let's go.
What doesn't have a company?
What doesn't have inmates.
It's this spreading of hand.
Other trans girls thank me.
To laugh, to teach her.
More than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes of brilliance.
And she thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
There's no job.
Understanding the difference is someone who can definitely change a world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be just the strange.
I'm a small part of what I do.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond strange.
But to understand this, I have a post of unknown, we really need to understand that we are a lot.
We are plural beings, the difference.
I don't know.
I refuse allies' beings.
Who died?
One will be there.
LP: Green and so blue.
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
And don't look at me anymore, I don't give myself peace.
I've already got away from my corridors.
In the past, only what's left are the scars.
What mark?
EV: But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being beside me, now I am, now I'll go.
That's it.
The flight.
Let's see.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology.
And, together, I worked with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
I've been doing this for many years and accompanying children.
Even with all my knowledge, communication, I couldn't often explain to children what cancer was.
What is in the treatment, protocols, procedures.
(Laughter) And they knew I had an ovarian score that doctors called "teratoma."
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to take a path, you won't get a saddle."
NB: Well.
It had been called, but I saw that, at the hospital, I could operate.
I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been established, given point nothing, and it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure.
I woke up ten hours later, noted, in the same yesterday I stayed with children with cancer.
I looked down, was full of tubes and connections.
(Laughter) The belly, I called nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
Then I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's outside the visitor's time."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
I cried only after the bedroom.
I used to travel with cancer, measures and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't Google."
Because after all,
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're in the sun.
(Laughter) So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was safe in that moment was that I was going to die.
Because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
That sometimes I didn't help, that I wouldn't engage, and how would you engage with someone?
If you can't even say the word "chance."
And I was stubborn.
AS: And ...
Opening what bothered me, forgotten, and forth, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized.
This is the information of society for them to donate hair.
In fact, it wasn't for me.
They opened what it was for him.
What wasn't able to see me here.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital,
The children said, "Wow, you've sewed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
I took it from you.
(Laughter) No, calm, we don't take it, you can stay close to me, don't take it.
And the games overcomed, and the children started to talk a lot of things and tell.
Over the procedures, when I went to put the catheter, because I did my therapy before, the first one made a portrait.
I got a hospital kit, which, at this kit, came a flavor.
A base has a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, an actor.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
This for my information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
And the children started to give me back their procedures.
So, they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we went on, we started playing.
But that's how we think the child doesn't understand, right?
who think the child doesn't know, she knows the name of chemotherapy protocol, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try not to talk to protect them.
And then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls."
Then the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy, and the pharmaceutic mother says it's a strong remedy: What will she think, who'll fall off her hair?
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it killed cells that doubled rapidly.
But not only the tumor cells double quickly, but also the hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to put catheter, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have both legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running," and there I, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising.
I called health professionals and my creative friends, and we decided to open an NGO.
We opened the BABA, which is the cancer BABA.
What did we do?
Usually, those who make health information are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But the patient approached the end.
This patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process.
We decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a long time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, and with that we illustrated the most common terms of the oncological environment.
We illustrated all this with the support of health professionals, but with something very important sometimes.
As something seems, you don't need to be explained when you like someone and you wrote, "I love you with your heart," you draw ventricles.
I think it's good, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand more the processes.
One of these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
AC: This guide is to distribute to children in treatment.
Unfortunately, we can only do about 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
What if there's a sponsor in the audience?
AC: For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened?
Instead of using hospitals, they started to ask, we're in more than 40 hospitals in Brazil.
The kids outside started to see, they started asking, children from Nova Zel√¢ndia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there are Portuguese, they were, but we have a translator."
And the guide is very asked in the northeast, because children and parents are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do.
With that, we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
and do several other actions.
The information is very important, and sometimes information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
No kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That you need to have information about everything.
For example, I don't know if you know more, when they do events, black children earn much more present and pay attention than children.
But sometimes the doll child has already done the treatment, he has no cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have a month.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't have.
And what happens with this and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, dark, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?
And then you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window to see a father with a good life, and when we need self-esteem?
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital.
To help some children?
She've saved my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others.
Thank you very much.
AC: In my career.
As a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because the dependence here gives me disease.
And a brain disease.
And a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
It's... isn't it?
BB: Here, from the fan.
What if, really, the answer is inside us?
To treat chemical dependency, what if patients really are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of those defense that can protect itself from great threats, this organism that has its own defense mechanisms, called "barring in being fake."
The myatocephal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain.
And what do they do with that?
And bacteria, viruses and harmful substances don't enter the brain and don't do it bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier.
They're very small molecules and, since they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the immediate barrier of being failed.
And that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain.
The circuit rewards in another circuit.
AR: We also have another protection system which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed of jungles, anticorpos and various chemical strategies.
That act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrophogo in the blood stream, running after a bacterium.
Until he is able to absorb it, dig it and neutralize it.
Well then.
Is that true?
We couldn't join these two things.
to help our patients?
The two mechanisms of defense.
They're inactive, they're us.
A few years ago?
We started discussing these issues until the day some researchers in the United States -
Studying people who end up using big drugs.
They realized that these people who used more drugs.
They produced anticpios.
Contracts drugs itself.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
It's enough!
AC: You don't need more drugs in the system, you're overcrowded.
And then, from this point ...
And we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
AR: We've been researching for some years.
In the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two.
What is it capable of sending this message to our immune system?
It's a message waiting.
I mean.
An immune system: it produces an anticopter.
Other drugs, and we'll try to help this person to gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our body?
It makes our immune system produce anticopios, these antic√≥phies are big molecules.
And then, that problem that the emerticephalic barrier had to let go straight away the drug stops giving up because when the user ...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is connected to a big and cut molecule.
We don't go into the mato barrier, you do it.
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is.
Here, the right of you?
We have a while that hasn't received the vaccine.
These white dots you can see is a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Once we managed to imunize them.
Here you see on your left side.
And there is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain.
What indicates is that, probably, this cocaine that went by stopped passing.
We asked ourselves, "Where did she stop, since she didn't happen?"
And it's very interesting that the rats ...
Vaccines have a much greater concentration in blood than rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocing the passage, it's a sharing of the molecules of radiation in the blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they get stuck inside the box or more inhibited what doesn't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
"So? What do you mean?
What our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people gain freedom, we believe.
What this treatment is, the therapeutic vaccine, or the antidrogen, can be a treatment.
What will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency.
Maybe some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide.
AC: A time to gain freedom again.
Discuting with themselves, if they want.
AC: To use not to use drugs.
Thank you very much.
I'm being.
Not psychotherapy.
There are more than 40.
And I want to read and say that -
Besides.
VR: Daneroses.
Narrator: Malen?
Psychosis.
There is a disease.
They have it.
In fact.
It's a nefasta disease.
who has hurt, lost, OK?
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I must say that...
Maybe?
These are one of the charming?
Great meeting of this TEDx.
At Saturd.
It's here.
A norm, Jos√©.
It's slow.
Funtuated.
"Where does it come from?"
What is the norm?
They are habits, attitudes.
It's a set of behavior.
Doct of social consensus?
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The war?
PL: Cool, for example.
Maybe it's an example.
The most deadly.
What is it?
So, love.
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
The norm is the location.
Sistenio.
The other is evolution.
Do they have it?
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
And it will not always exist.
The norm is a disease.
Chipic.
At times?
"OK."
And we live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It doesn't predict corruption.
Dehumanity?
In his word, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This is adapting to a sick and healthy system.
I've been.
Is it a worker?
More than 30,000 years ago.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is the absence of conflicts.
And I said, "No.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace?
How?
The line, the Chinese wisdom, is pregnant.
How many wars?
That's where it comes to be.
A little peace.
What military for peace?
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person should, that one ...
that has the ability to present themselves in tomatoes.
Sintomas with you?
Sometimes even.
A despair, conscious, light.
Is it an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
from a family shell.
When is my daughter?
Isabela.
I was five years old.
And today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked her.
What princess do you like most?
Gataweira, Cinderela?
The fallen asleep?
She thought.
And he answered.
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
And I said, "I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes...
Because it has to be the safety.
In your own skin.
A pain ...
The contradictions.
And the "normotic".
I don't know.
People who looked for me?
With panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
What a capture!
It had open gates of awareness.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
Is it the myth?
of humanity, in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
And forests?
"Do you not desertify?"
And these people say, "Dad, me.
My respect is the world.
Dominated people.
Psychiatrics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why in Africa ...
People considered crazy are also considered serious.
Simple.
Because they are like a blink that captures.
The contradictions.
Cultural?
There's no.
And sometimes it won't do it.
And how did I say it?
What's crazy?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Right?
Where others don't know.
He said, "No.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent.
What we call this.
OK?
Sequatic are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an ins√¥nia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I ...
I think.
In an occasion I came to give a seminary, here?
That's it, lie.
"Uh."
It's a taxi driver.
Or knowing I was.
A psychotherapist told me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
And he's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
What do I do?
"What am I trying to do this?"
He went back to lunch.
"So? What do you mean?
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all of them.
The idea is to adjust.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
Nothing against it.
At that moment ...
That you suffer a desire too.
"No.
And did you say that?
It's from norms, machismo.
Does racism?
Is homophobia?
DJ, right?
Exclusions.
"Well, love!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
Nermosis gives it.
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything from a deaf person.
And torta's salt catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mine, and lives, and it doesn't realize.
Your existence doesn't make sense.
We showed the indexes.
In an unexorable globalization, a person?
That, usually, the specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It's a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
Apontate it.
As being.
A possibility of solution?
What am I calling vocation?
It's the deepest voice.
of the wish it brought us.
The incarceration.
It's what brings us on a stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise to do.
And we don't see here.
Just for a small one.
We saw a story.
And only you can happen.
And if you didn't realize it, it got lost.
"So? What do you mean?
In foundation?
It gives us voices.
[A.DE.]
Or situations.
There's another one.
This is very important.
I evolved.
It's also been said.
JJP: Great.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird?
From a snake, from a face?
I think of a friend, "Wow, it's an iPad.
And with an alternative Nobel Prize?
Mom's developing country was Max, Life, Chile.
When I met my adoption, he told us that, since a child, he wanted to know that human beings differentiate themselves.
And the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
And the language, "No, it's culture, no."
It's humor, no.
One day, talking to his father, he was very respectful.
His father said.
Isn't it my stupidity?
He woke up a little light, and he said it's become.
The first studio.
It's a fantastic astrology, a science we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is it?
That's absolutely...
And at Denoa, I like to remember Rulentura.
And she told us, "It's necessary!
I said, "It's yours."
The photovoltaic video, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest which will be brave.
The question is stupidity.
Because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and she can also be.
That's it.
To have diplomas and universities.
"What's it?"
And to do it as a person who's talking about developing, with graphs, tablets.
Suphisticated, like a person sitting down.
In the branch of a tree, sweat.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
For him.
I had only one.
Two infinite things.
The universe is human stubbornness.
And he agreed: Einstein.
How about the universe?
I still have it.
But I need to say that I discourse.
Diainist and Dia.
Max nephimbora respecting us and considering what?
They are pointing out not to their characteristics.
From the species, yes, from the norm.
Human beings?
Isn't it from nature?
But helpidity, on the contrary?
We are born to be, to flourish.
To serve?
So ...
I prefer to think.
Let's not confuse it.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
What differentiates our species of other species?
It's the inbalance, it's incomplete.
We don't.
We are born humans.
And we make ourselves humans.
A tortuga is born, you're never tired, you've already seen and go to the sea.
And we said, "No.
Do we do it inaccabate?
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or air?
It's so pleasant.
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain.
Since the 17th century, it seems that it's only about developing a rational calling, no.
It's said.
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul of psyche, develop emotional intelligence and relaxational intelligence.
Unirious obsession of dreams, to learn to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Play values of ethics.
With a heart.
Their own ...
What a madness!
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
At 15?
I oweated my heart.
To learn.
At 30 I submitted my species.
Steady on the floor.
At 40.
And I didn't suffer anymore.
"Pee" for the exhibition.
At 5?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Obceived?
I'd hear the invitation of oil.
At 70.
I could follow the instructions of my own heart, because what I wanted to not anymore, the borders.
It's for justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
And he told us, 2,000 years ago, you change the street.
And five minutes, I can be an entire existence.
to change.
Which one?
And this is the task.
In that sense?
A nurmose?
And it refers to an evolutionary estagnation.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: how to adhere?
21st century.
The third world.
And nothing less than this finds together.
In the future.
The new ones.
G√©ras.
"So? What do you mean?
The norm is terrible because it's insidious, it's in silencing.
People don't realize it.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being.
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to orch.
To Servi.
Did someone ask?
I launched.
Say God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
Are they human beings?
Potentially.
I am.
"So? What do you mean?
I want ...
Still talking?
It doesn't happen from a story that we hear.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned it with us.
It was once.
A forest.
Not to give up.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
All of us.
PC: Men!
Let's not flow!
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
He played in the middle of the bus and came back.
With patience.
Chinhas?
GB: That's it.
What a little girl!
I was in the middle of the man, "A boy, Jo√£o, seeing that, said more, "Stay flower?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
Little things.
Are you going to turn off this fire?
The hell?
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
It's a TED friend.
Now, I'm doing...
Oh, there's no.
We're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because 100 years went by.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little.
of love?
In this little world, the big world trusted each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions...
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe?
Connect, right?
I do it with others, with others.
Comundo and comestive.
I recommend a book: "The Aquarian conspiration of Marily Fex."
We studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, through narrative.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he is part of him.
And that is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
Since the morning, I can see drums.
Who do you wish?
Each one talking about their own drop had given.
And all of you in this room?
That's it.
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on the agenda.
But on stage...
You have your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Maybe only.
It's to complain.
Sorry.
So, what?
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewing.
I love it.
"You are."
I grew up.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving one.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Cecillia.
Let's see.
Renova.
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
It brings the eyes that they had seen.
And many others.
For other visions.
White professions?
What is this fear?
To be forgotten.
Sorry.
I would always be the same.
There's always another.
But yes.
JS: Oh!
I feel it.
Longe.
And inside.
That's it.
OK?
In a good school.
(English) choose.
Tiriboas, no.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
I always have to be a lawyer, an advertising or a markets.
Since my mother has reality.
I went to a resignation college.
Public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
She had some multinational company that didn't recognize me by her family.
It's three months.
She works 12 hours per kidney, high up to her strength's limit.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
Make interminable meetings.
Docks will not take somebody's off, show that you're important for the structure.
And more than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
Go ahead.
I had a sixlexic point.
The encounter is someone.
Namoro, relief, wedding.
He said, "I'm a speaker."
Scalled corporative pyramid.
He sees the shirt.
AC: Shut up.
A lot of job.
Be a manager.
Carre of the firm.
What does Freud and happy mean?
CF: Happiness, Georamarca?
We'll have bad cuts and sapatoes.
Go.
The shirt.
The Moon and the first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years.
Your second child.
It's listening.
Except that the car year, yes, no year.
She bought an apartment and holds 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
Disney?
In two years later, it was all seven days per Europe.
Miami, Europe, Miami.
More meetings that don't take somewhere, completely unqualified people, being promoted before you.
Projects that start and devastate like their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
It's like them.
The baby is socially up every day.
The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle-time crisis.
The encounter with my colleagues from college, my God, as the years went fast.
The kids at school.
My God, as they have grown fast, is the hidden life.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach at the weekend in the mountain.
We'll sell the beach apartment, the children grew up and don't even want to go further, to see the shirt.
The cholesterol is a little high, its body flattered, like an astronaut that spent years fighting in zero gravity.
(Laughter) No face and because of the healthy habit of going through dental thread, I place all infections.
(English) "Lut the end."
It's cold, green juice.
A semestal Plan of the academy you used for two months, today it's fourth, fair days, fair hamburgues, after staying late, at the firm, to close a project, because life is too short to eat easy.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing jobs, today, don't appreciate any more experience.
Less of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
It's a continuous feeling that prevents you from living, fear of death, a beautiful feeling of suffocation, "Where is the air, otherwise I'm focused?"
The complete disconnection with its children decorating from the 12 hours of work in the decade.
The retirement is empty.
To be each of useless and little affection.
AC: You're a winner, this is your only tip.
His life as an executive executive.
Go ahead.
GG: Wood.
JC: Thank you.
