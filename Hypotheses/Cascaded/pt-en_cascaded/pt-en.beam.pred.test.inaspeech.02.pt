Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary.
that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
Everything started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times they would buy clothes, "Um."
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewel to do some adds?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
Now that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
That was it.
to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
One of them was a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I made her a threat with a very high cause, the elastic of the blind to make more comfort.
I made a hyper-descret to make her exchange for the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I did it for Carlena.
A light is that it was open in the shoulders.
A warm of button of pressure to make it easier when you pass your head.
By the way?
For people who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a room that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
And for women, with anism or low stature?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
My excitement in this work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there is.
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped Prots.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world that is already in the décima edition?
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
which are the big companies.
Special and conceptual marks that realized the real need of this dressed room.
They are already launching collections, like the Americans take.
And it's already in your second inclusive collection due to the size of success that was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
My family always came from the rock, I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Children of four years old, until adolescence, and go by adult: my community, I started working with animal, and I started to raise awareness of people, as ...
Putting trash, knowing how to separate one trash from the other, so I tried to talk with the children, people recognize me in the community, and I studied only until Ith grade, I didn't have the privilege of a school for me to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
And I go with the children I know.
In my community, we have a collection of seeds, when we go to the forest, to work with this affection, we have a plant.
When I met a plant called Hengar's name, it's a legominous plant that we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I eat.
While below it, we have a good result.
But I tried to imitate with a huge forest, so I tried to imitate the forest, because there in the arm.
Was there a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I have to plant them variating, there I have the aaiu, the cup, graviola, Andiróba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná, and that's not a plague.
We come there.
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside?
Comparation of ours: in our community, we work there with organic production.
You eat everything natural, there's no toxin in our community, "Oh ..." (Laughter) I follow the human being as an animal.
The child, I compare her and, as only paid, you talk, she stays listening and passing me to other children.
So, I was looking for my knowledge, we have to be patient, we have to show love, the greatest care for those children, and it was putting everything in the army, my father says, "The first lesson we have to pass by someone has to come from our homes, so I'm paying, and I'm paying for this attention," after he talks to talk to the other animal.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person who observes my house. I kept observing my house. (Audience) Som!
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's very funny. So, I saw that all this with my work that was doing with children, had a future, it would work out, and today we have...
With a job inside, with which is far from the atom.
The kilometers of the atom, when I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the turtle of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we are reproducing the river, which before had a hooligan in front of us, above the little of our community, and that hooligan she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
So, I went by with people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... we breathe a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest, is always talking to people educating children.
And, passing with other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small.
That I'm like that.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and approach us, we're talking, awareness people, and I'm very happy.
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I feel guilty, personally, and thank you very much, guys.
I'm gay.
In contrast with the name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
I wish these children, they're very proud.
In my family, and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream, reality, and create this family.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
This leads life to risk.
Imagine all the more and parents who are here, as we feel.
Like a fear that lost his child.
And we had two options, could we?
to collapse, to cry, or...
It's to solve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a beautiful mood to find.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured.
What about it?
It was incredible because all the school's most friends and all of us did a very big movement, sharing the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, all the movement, very beautiful.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
That when a child bounces you and authentic life, all or rest problems of fears, worry, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and that's why we learned this lesson and spread it to our friends, to the school's more, to society, Facebook people, talking about it, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
(Laughter) The second message he had with this disease, publicly, and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all these families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a warmer divorce, or important, I love the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease, to the world, "What?"
My blood, my medular oil, we started to make them, our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so if he raised this awareness, we have this ability to donate blood so he needs, and you know, isn't it just?
For someone with cancer, blood, blood, if necessary in the couples, when we have an accident, at any moment, they all ecosystem and need it.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's one ...
About 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you were winning a mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I got married... Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to save in life, if me, more strength, if no pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that ...
Or also, "I'm thank you all."
By supporting us, by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
It's called Leikon.
You looked at it.
Basically, it's like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is "Pala-La del Tinaü."
I'm serious.
I was born in Damasco.
Capited from Syria.
In January.
I studied at Damasco University.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not Brazil with my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little difficult.
In front of the Portuguese.
That's why.
This is excuse.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today.
I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brocity that exerces Slam."
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with this one.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was from Vinci.
Three million kisses.
I had ...
My family.
My friends I knew about this child.
Three, two, already cut down.
I'm an Engineering writer.
Two apartments.
I, a car.
In Damasco.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Foli.
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started.
March 15.
It was my 11th.
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all the other cities in the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had delivered: Vinci.
It's 25 bombs.
Origia.
How good!
Five years of war.
This is my country.
It's a hero.
People: whom I know were forced to charge or left their children.
They found their voices.
Vert and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiares disappeared.
And they didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, my family would come back again.
Or not?
Today.
Millions of Syrian will lose everything.
They were dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, our mind and our life remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country as a day, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
After, ten months.
Obviously, Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
So I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassad and say that São Paulo was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
And TEDxApinas.
Or a week, shine back.
Fifty years of my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, my children's birthday, and they all said very well, the food my good friends talked about, I enjoyed it was the kitchen.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
Hi, I created "Dagine on Facebook" or "Talk with Syria," that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) I'm there with Syria video.
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boro Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world is.
He was closed by Branus.
Etress, because of war and terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islã, today in the morning, here, or a journalist tells me, "I, after what happened in France?"
Now, and I don't want to talk, talking, or contact with a person, a submano.
A lot!
That Islam loves blood.
which is allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly ...
The diving.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More also white, or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image.
A basic religion.
Alcurão.
I'm not a sacred book since a person in which she had killed all men and who read life, it's like the life of all men at Curão, in her life, at the school 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When those of her came, a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that covered my hair, just like my wife, was my wife.
Do you ask questions like?
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home as well?
(English) "Aline de Reijabi."
Today, read other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, kiss, sex, only voice, wedding.
Some people told me.
But I've already seen humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Look, Tao Slam has these rules, more than each person wants to buy or not.
The "deblata bem" prohibits some things to be the same way the states that don't obey everything.
It's not good that I didn't put myself as a battle of fat into alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Let's do it.
With more than a partner.
This didn't happen to me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because these things are forgotten of isolation.
Our religion is very important for music.
But, in spite of not knowing the coin, then.
That the agency explains people always, understand.
It's respect.
Profeita Mohamádez, that we must respect all religions.
That everyone has the same value.
That we should have!
Beautiful.
With all of us.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black or Indians.
Oislam also says that we should help the people who need.
Every year we have Alsaacá and we give two dots, five percent.
All of our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are glasses or jodes.
And I invite you to learn more about "lam."
I'm sure it was something to be and to understand that it was a basic privilege.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
To finish with the "Obrecent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children.
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is Sélia Mole?
PC: In small stories of life.
I come to recite my tears, in the sun ships in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up to the roles of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe, soon I lose hope, but, in the daily bucket, I know who suffers: "The strength makes food, my salary ends, just like this would run."
The girl started, it was what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Fascinira.
Why didn't he hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you take me so much to pay a secret course, but don't even enter the office?
I'm sorry, I made an event here, yes, to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
So, ME is CT, be a maid, if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, I gave myself an opportunity.
And the teacher told me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, enter that little room that the vessor is waiting, welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, I'm a maid.
I had to run the day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life, so I took a day in the middle of my running.
I was told in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach's topic, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid, and how I use Facebook, like the day.
I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, a girl, everything is put on Facebook, tomorrow is my new diary, came to the memory of returning this on Facebook, and I'll use the hashtag, and I'll use a maid, so that, if other people have gone through this, they'll complain, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past, always talking about the things that came to my mind, because I was a 24-hour worker, this became a funny viral.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story on the Internet, it was a reference to my last job as a maid in Santos city, that in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook, and my boss prevented me from feeding my own food.
I had to bring the container, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared it.
This first story on the internet went viral very quickly, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media, the international media, and the national media.
They're from London, the German TV Dábio and several waves.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, than everyone.
Everyone!
All of them got very excited when I started talking about the housing situation in Brazil.
And then, they were able to rebuild and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
domestications are more valued, they earn.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive advertising advertisements that I titled as abuse announces, for hour, so completely different here in our country.
It was for workers and working secondly.
Access.
At 8 am.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started doing paper. This became a daily practice. So what I did was home, rubbed all the quickly, there are domestications, passing through these conditions still today, winning 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, every month, every month, there are households, suffering all those tips to buy the books I always did, and to come to my surprise, Regina comes in the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing about the experiences I'd already gone through the past, and then she started to show me several texts, which, in 2009, when I went to college, I was very nervous, and then she sat there with me and said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Desculp, I started to get out here and I saw there was a book and exaggerate."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, and I exhibit some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, today I'm here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone.
Why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they were suspicious, after graduation, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on, and so on?
"Yes."
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Laughter) And I always say that the biggest house in the past are domestic slaves in the past, and it's a not that distant past, it's very low to us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern age.
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come, "If there's no payment day," and when I get there, I'm already wearing the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was the maid's money."
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered, I who was there, I only wanted to see, she got married, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to marriage, but as I'm a deaf person, and she hit me a sadness.
Because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little lower of the employee, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who's going to work, and yet he goes back home, to hide me, and the only solution I had was when my boss will work.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his cassette, because when I say I'll change employment, my friends say, "Menine, stay, you gain 1,800 reais per month, you'll never get that value in another place."
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service.
I brought my pot of saving, my picnic, and I was there, in the salt of service, tight, took my sailbow pot and did this in number one, and my pattern saw it, I was very scared, and said, "Why are you wearing the deaf pot?
It's the maid's money, "Today I'm here."
By mixing statistics, for some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined to your family to come."
So, you have to be happy, being come, so I'm here, counting the statistics: black woman, fat woman ... (Applause)
(Applause) Woman arrested, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
(Applause) Antrans of me have 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they will be, what I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
We'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, but only to see that six million households are being represented now, because in other countries various domestications, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, so I'm here, it would be in the statistics, I'm not talking about six million houses.
They're from African branches, not mandated.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny, exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
I first take the time of my talk to disconnect.
You turn off your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you know.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing the 8th grade, the conceptual day of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
Open your agenda, bravo.
Take your eye.
And it's insecurity and equipment.
I propose inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote, he spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to the state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
From this feeling, from this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
This is a cure.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
It's determining my choices.
Now, recently, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his eyes.
Several of you.
They thought.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
You listen to me.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
Do you call it?
Look at this step.
It's not close to you, it's off.
Turn off your cell phones?
(Laughter) Put your bags, the floor, put your cell phones on the floor.
That's it.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
with everything closed.
You're not disconnected, you've taken the tool closely from you.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
in São Paulo.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"Let's look at her in the face of these ways!"
You're good, you got even a little kiss.
AC: He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where they are?
You wait.
Do you see?
"Yes."
You see ... (Exhaling) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Remember the ceiling?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
In the human brain, we are connecting space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
Which brings the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality: it's new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
A habit in our lives are self-awareness technologies.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another autensity, silence is a source of freedom.
I laughed.
This is what reaches the first video, right?
From a demand of a region of Formos Idete who asked for success.
My friends, your colleagues, your family.
Once more than just one.
At least, it has an influence in English.
How do she wake up like this?
The translator is the key.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
Ten percent of them are Brazilians.
Seven and 16 young people.
And with almost all the time in 6,000 translations made.
These are made in events, like these here.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment to do this?
But it's in Portuguese, first it's transcribed in animal language.
Look after being green for me, instead, and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
Followly, the "e" that we can translate as entertainment, topics like TED technology.
And do you get out?
Those who are thirsty or shout, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
Species that come back at times of chance.
The theme is this auditory event.
It's that he has a curriculum we have, then not only we do.
With also reduction.
I said, "This video is about 20 Brazilian reals."
It's to translate and transcribe as one of the eye.
Think about the TEDx environment.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what a translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only delicious, sometimes I say another song.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent.
In initiatives like this one.
And become what it is potentially, that I don't have everything in education.
And I also have no doubts, I have to study.
And when is it a fish, is it a volunteer?
Because I always choose my own decision.
And try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different from donating.
And men were extinct.
A part of knowledge has started.
It changes research.
Many jobs, many hours of research.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent, to be ours, of fear.
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be 1,000 million.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide the reason: the majority.
Or as we call "C."
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, that we have Portuguese Portugal, which is very different, we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here.
Very well ... (Audience) Hi!
I have to hear it.
What do I live there?
Like a deep, political crisis, right?
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Nevertheless, I knew this baby very well and did the four mathematics operations, and their dream was always able this.
And to do how their children follow, that's why, gay who lived in our neighbor called "Taiobeiras."
In some parts, my father arrives instead of his beginning, his logic is their finger, and his place.
If you also knew, as a businessman, they had a small hotel from a presence store that had been resting years.
In 1960.
He stayed, literally, without any years when you killed your old furniture.
One felt very humble with his economic clown, and my father decided.
My mother, who has been here for years now, is helping me, right?
It was not to know about cooking.
training centuries, my hand, and she decided to do "consects" to sell.
What kind of queijo was internally?
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it works.
A big question, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by homicilious amuses.
And this obsession, this step, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
And a notebook body prevents, where the prideprodozone shoot, a prize, the premise that appeared at home.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest athletes of parochia.
But for my father, she would get away from the river.
Without knowing, he had to train.
Buildings much better than the ones we've had, and here I tell you my greatest passion in my audience's life, are my two pounds, from myel, João Inlique, whom I've never put this coal to have the newspaper for me, but for those I've done left.
It's always a pleasure for me.
Coincident, isn't it coincidence?
Four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is always a server, at some point in life, and one of my brothers is an educator without absolutely fantastic creative, revolutionary ideas that it applies.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
It has to do with queen.
I do more than TEDx, just like my father would be such a simple way in the instants.
TEDx inspires us.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with our army, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
(Laughter) During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they stay how they worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super-conplicated.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a ticket.
It's a tiny that allows you to describe in braille.
On the street, you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, I gave tips, and, with that, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the schedule.
We started to research, thinking that there would be thousands of processes of this, they would go online, and it would be ready to connect with the engines, and we would have a clock.
But he saw that there was no Internet, before deciding what is our own, we started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaked and nothing happened, but we did writing everything, disconnected and reconect everything and started to work, and, about a month ago, we ended the clock and showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to try to make a small report or a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest, can help with their aunt's inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So, we wanted to show a video, our aunt beyond the time on the clock, our senses, the picks, and let the message that many things seem very simple, still weren't created, and, if we, two students from high school, who hadn't even finished, in high school, we're according to the innovator, there's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask you a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people, they can put the manual.
Audience: Yes.
OK, we're all cutting, two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual depression.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression that profuses, the only difference or the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercial is that there's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the objective of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their advertisers, receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about, and I'm not here to talk about cases involved.
Children?
The cases involved lower than 16 years or adults who didn't make sense than their consent are crime cases, they are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, forever, therefore, a storming prostitution and forgotten frustration.
And it also doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse that, in this case, against sexual exploitation.
In other words, but to take all the people who do prostitution through traffic victims for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, that Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that cancro Portugal, confirmed, 118 traffic victims.
Human.
Almost all of them for job exploitation, victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, it was enough to see a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
(Laughter) What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is disappointed from reality.
There is an image in a very stereotype related to prostitution.
But, many times, people take all the people who are in prostitution as victims.
They are defeats, structured, and there's something that expects someone to save them.
But this doesn't respond to reality either, or it's just another stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, that is, we know that there is a diversity of construction that influences the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I meet a researcher, interview, I'm with people who do sex work, what they say is that it will be an option, with a punished option, after equation in advantages and disadvantages, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly disgmatized and isn't recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think what is the image you see immediately in your mind when you think of a person that prostituates.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or any other one.
Or, a woman with a bad appearance and minissaia who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, who is very likely a peaceful parent, and who, of course, has somebody plural.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
of practices?
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
But it's not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work and there are transgender women, not only cigarette women, there are also many women with sexual work transgender, for example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Does anyone on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are powerful and flaws.
And the accidental cities.
Try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, telling us that...
Please, Sindroa.
which will only represent us 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they're less, they're minor, but they're not negligible.
I'm going to give you the studies of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by the third sonhadia of the University of Esbola, and who interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of internal, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10,2% of men.
And now, 7.8 percent of trans women and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated, so, when the speech does about the victim of men who are in sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'm going to tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, sorry.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not prohibited to sell sex, but it's a crime.
Communication of sex, the idea that is based on this law is that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and that indicates that this law puts in greater risk their own gender wisdoms, put their own sex wisdom together, and that increase the great success of traffic of this law and how it diminished prostitution.
Therefore, stigma and disease.
Audience: Yes.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that, without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between us.
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, but there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of eliminating clients is unfortunate.
Because they're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
He has the right to his sexuality, and now he fails any argument that tries to be in favor of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
(Applause)
If people think that for them, it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to face their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
He talked about work connections.
If this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why are stigmas so intense and strong about the people who do sexual work, why do we keep condemnating so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
It's the cause of morality.
And specifically, moral.
Sexual, who split sexuality into two types to the side of a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" considered ilogitimate.
Anormal, anti-natural, and that's when the beginning of sex is located.
And the fact that this sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is based on stigmatization, the descreidibilization of people who do this activity, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers, like, for example.
(Laughter) When they drive in institutions in the health area, justice and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little fear that I don't know if someone used this word, not TEDxBas, the stigma of puta.
It's the worst that can fall on women.
That's why the worst offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and disabled people, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense?
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of control of women's sexuality, it's a sort of democrate mirror that's above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that is socially divided, there's the risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
It's your body!
Why do I think we can do any of us so that they don't keep on trying to disrespect sex-free?
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence. This has already been said in the morning in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
(Sigh) And also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge stigma, as I'm here now, and to give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time, sex workers are everywhere organized to use 70 but, precisely because of stigma, their voice has no credibility, they are not ears, they haven't been told, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
(Laughter) After all that.
And to finish?
I think it would make sense.
It's natural that we should keep derespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex workers.
Thank you very much.
This response, when we got there, the binder, in the last ten years, simplification that I found to have a technical judgment, which we brought from São Paulo to practice schedule, the residence had a lot of schedule, but, at the same time, I have to have a fashion to have a good news for you, which also, when we got there, when we got there, we got there, to have a technical judgment in Tecnica, the Tecnica video of Tecnica, Tecnica, Tecnica, Tecnica, Tecnica, Tecnica, Templica, Templica, Templica, Tempnica, Templica, Tecnica, and Templica, Templica.
Once we did it wrong, we got someone who had a brilliant stadium, with the same research, healing, typics, signing, poetry, and we handed a technical stadium that knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
(Laughter) So why did Greece consider, instead of having a method, the worry about the best-pacent relationship, a medicine that is pop, was developed, replicated, and, even today, is used in the medicine graduation in the world?
It was made a sector that, before Christmas, I give a door.
These are slightly complex words that I said three words here.
In all houses, I just said to see the benefit of the patients, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduation of women, men, children and cermos.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
If I respect this law and not violate it, it would be the right to go for a reputation between men in all times, that if I transcribe the violin, what happens to me the opposite?
Why, already at that time, this one I occupied for this, and still today, do you do training?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to go back because the patient's relationship is impressive for a good cure. So today, few things are registered for the judgment of one.
And, in this case, I was honored to participate in a profession that is taken for judgment.
The medical knowledge in Greece, an individual, we're going to specialize a lot, damaged the disease, and we're losing the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't."
But sometimes, I was in class at college, in small groups classes, as teachers, and I tricked that you are like this: "Look, patients have aography, resonance, in two pipsology, the illustration.
I'll look for their belly's hands, I can't face awareness.
"Oh, I also think of composition."
The guy called me a little, called everyone and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
And he honestly looked, "Dad, since I saw the president didn't smoke anymore, Buraco Dustin, to show that the aggregated movies, "We're mappers, it's smooth, you can come to a patient, there's a moment of kindness, he's being able to take care of something that doesn't make us, and says, "If all this hasn't convinced us."
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move on it.
At that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, to be blaming black, to want to do good there, to be good, to be asking him, to be careful with you.
This is this magic, it's not only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
The house doesn't know why it appears, there's no surgery operation, there's no change for a long time, no rays, no routes, it's nothing, it's functional diseases, but more and more aggrees that have a more precocient ral, children and Têm, in Christmas, are diseases that have a symptom.
This happens, does it happen because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the patient's relationship.
But to be a patient, a patient, and to be passive, to those who are saying this to me.
What you're going to say to a group of obstacles because, after all, the active act of the relationship aren't the doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
There are my doctors against two.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive and passive, and we have to hold our hands, etc.
The first point, the most important, is to inform.
It's no use the owner talked about Dr. Google, who's fashionable. When I was a child, there was an ex-copes of size in the Medicine and the United States, there was a book read about health, and that always existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a publisher, to see that you had to have content to talk with Google today, you have an insinity of information, lots of tips, but, many tips, very bad ones, and we need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog.
(Laughter) In my blog, only 1,3% of people enter my curriculum, but to know who I am.
This gives me a huge call, because people enter there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they must have for anything, that said to me, "Mal, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money or game."
So, that's time.
Second very important thing: don't believe in good things, being aligned, "Look, medicine has changed, now their problems usually ended, third.
Differently a laboratory, with the scientist, will have a recovering and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my most was when I don't know: silly.
Look, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry doesn't interest you to know this, be silly, nobody dominates information, it's difficult, there's some other with cross-functional interests, so these things stopped me is that they don't present.
And for a lot.
Take the information, discuss it to your doctor, it was for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and information: knowledge, get your training, participate in your cure, but blame the costume.
Second important thing to be active in the action of the cure process.
It's to ask, to demand, to know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves, you have the right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to help me," I've been working for 20 years.
But I don't think that's going to change the day to night, when I have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in my body, it's not that, it's crazy to know.
There is, if we compost with time, we go.
And to make atendments different.
The method they want is this: they want the right loss.
They don't want to have this attempt, like, "No time," they want to take care of the car.
Audience: Yes.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, I showed up mountains, human wetlands, that we had from a patient there, he had sneakers cancer, a human dot.
The orometric index didn't talk to the gays, the doctor didn't speak German, and, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation, which, to me, would give a scene from a movie standing, he was really stuck, and, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow that of a movie that spoke very good Portuguese.
What I'm trying to say with this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
This magic that wants the art of healing, in that moment we talk about, I'm proud to think that there's a doctor to be caring for producers, without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of him, glories, and consultations.
We, doctors, can try to find more unity of our treatment, treatment thing, and all patients can do the case of a connection, go to the better world, and you'll be better treated, more compassion, thank you.
(Laughter) What I really like these experiments is an experiment that was done with this iconos magazine, and the person, more or less, a decision in every two seconds, changed my way to take institutions, and what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option, with 59 hours also, chose as CR52.
The experience he made a comparison would be a lot about this, I studied a lot about it, I studied that the situation of the middle has even the name, and a talk that, by the way, had two options of the idea, which seems a little bigger, because I have a different decision, that we see and neuroscience applied to the pieces is only a big size, because I have a optical decision, if I can have, if I can have it, and I can have the same way, in the way, and see that we see, that we see, we see, we, ourselves, and we, ourselves, the same way, and we don't have the same thing, and we don't have the same thing, and we don't have the same way.
So, in those 35,000 decisions we hear, but, in fact, I came to a research about the Economics Review. It was in this moment, gathering this concept with the concept of Reflexion, that we have a smartphone, close to us, and in the world of technology, not even the name, to this profession, that makes the architecture of decisions, and I'm doing what everyone in my decision, and I'm doing, and I'm doing what to do with what we have money, and I'm doing, and I'm also doing, with a project that has to bring a project, a project that has a project, for me, for me, for me, and for me, for me, a profession, for me, and for me, for me, for me,
When the panic and the rhythm comes from a person, is it that everyone will change the decisions we're from them and shout the power, or that the range that those of giving are often about us, so that the digital will take for us, and we put the websites and we place the websites?
(Laughter) (Laughter) When I got to know this number I asked myself, "Why is it in Austria 99% of donors and young people, what in Austria you're already from Adopiobnb, what in Austria is 91% of 12 years?"
You need to ask you to go out, in Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter, so there's a magic word called "defol."
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call the decision to capture birth, you need to ask to leave. (Laughter) Someone has taken this picture for you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my cell phone these days, and then I had two options: one promised the senses and another to receive offer; the recipes were dismantled by the offers and was killing.
So someone decided I wanted Férnica, I didn't want to receive it, so I went there and came to leave.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was already there already marked to get Google and tell a story, but I talk a lot of Uber, I don't know if you get a work they love to talk, I thought it was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's story, which a lady chose PUP.
When he got to the car, another person in the car, and he caught the strange and said, "Well, there's another car's passagger, he looked at her and said, "This person has chosen the cube."
And she said, "I bought the guy."
So Barcelona chose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, and it's very interesting that we can imagine whoever makes these decisions: if we are a Google today to eat a person, it has 57 thousand results.
What are we clicking?
(Laughter) 91% of people explain the results of the first Google page.
And who chose a place where we will eat from people was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the website, (Laughter) I love the website, then I see from there what is the website "No, I go to the right and click page.
(Laughter) So, to ask this ... (Laughter) In fact, that's Google, it's Uber giving us little pushers.
These emphasis in English have a name in the behavior economy also has a name, they are called "innants."
(Laughter) It's not just a little push in English. I want to ask you to study a little push on the person next to you: don't notice the board ... (Laughter) They're an ecology, beauty, there's a theory of an author named Nantes.
And the concept of "digitive" is the name I gave to a simple way of understanding these little pushers in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought they were adults.
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a photo of me cutting the ice ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) You're thinking that only whoever falls on this is European from Austria and Detina Marca, "All everybody here has received a confirmation e-mail in TEDx.
(Laughter) Luis Pica, me, more than four people who read the link, in the midst that a text written: "All introduce yourself in a person's TEDx, you're automatically being the power of all your decisions you'll take in your life and ask you to leave how many inscribed people."
According to the things I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave and I show the results ... (Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of the lives of 300 and 170 conversations here. (Laughter) No, this was just an experiment, to have this knowledge of these discomforts.
Necessity.
This can do because we obviously manipulate.
The danger says yes, knowledge is a tool.
If you have it, you can use it to do because someone buys something they don't need, so you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use to make a diabetes patient know the right time as well as insulin.
Or can you use it?
To avoid truck accidents, like this bottle, at the same time, whatever measures.
Of the cerebral waves is detected to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016, which did it with what?
People from the world describes 144 billion steps.
What do you imagine was that?
Pokémon Go is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better.
How do these urban planets work, how do these ideas work?
We'll be able to build a better world, we'll be able to build better interfaces.
We were able to be more aware that we made better decisions, thanks.
