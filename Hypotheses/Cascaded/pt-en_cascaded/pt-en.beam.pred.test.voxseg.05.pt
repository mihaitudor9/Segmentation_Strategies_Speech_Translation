How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everything.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
What is it difficult to put clothes on?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
And it's interesting for fashion.
What about it?
People kept in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations.
from the locker room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including with a paraplete.
They were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in it.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that served their lives.
VR: Necessities.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, "Um ...
Two larger numbers.
They took them to the sewage to make some joys?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
And outside that they lost a lot of time.
I lost some money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
Let's do this work and these conversations?
It's the conclusion I got.
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
Was the adapted clothes I made?
It was to Juliana.
One of them was a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
The day I did for her.
A square with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort, which I made a discreet to give her the exchange of the probe which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the vestiblio of this block.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other uncle, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a whip opening on her shoulders, with the pressure button's closing, to facilitate, when her head was passing.
VV: In fact.
For someone?
that are quadriplegic, the ideal.
Is it to think of a college entrance?
and facilitate those who will dress the person.
paraplegic.
What did it do?
What is dressing alone?
AC: In this last fashion that I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the challenge day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and label them in brains for us.
People can have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
What about Kelle?
Tinanism.
What about women?
With low status or low status, the ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
Why don't they need to find ideal clothes anymore?
Children's childish obsession.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped Prots.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know?
And it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition.
What's already happening?
This is an edition.
GG: I leave.
It was and I made a dress.
This is Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Drika!
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Little brands.
AC: You're already adapting pieces in your collection.
But it was out there.
That the big companies, famous and designed brands?
They realized the real need for this dressed room and they're already launching schools.
And as the American woman takes, who is already in her second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
That all of us!
And we should think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking only about it.
Fashion, inclusive, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Why will we be?
(Music ends) All equals.
Our difference.
Thank you very much.
Casada with a name.
I have two kids, wonderful.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Germaine.
Sofia.
They're very proud.
There are also families and very degrees, these women.
The children helped.
To make this dream come true.
Thank you very much.
Two months ago, our son was so credited, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasty and a leucemia.
That's not it.
(Laughter) It puts the lifetime's life.
Imagine all the blindest ones in them.
How we don't feel that.
It was like a fear that I lost a challenge.
We have two options.
We don't know how to fly, to cry.
What does it solve?
NJ: No.
Fortunately.
And continue looking for a doses mulla.
VV: That's it.
For him, I was able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs.
It's about it.
From then on.
It was really incredible because all the most.
And all my friends, ours.
They made a whole movement, very big, sharing the press, social media, everywhere.
So, taking people to play blood, to donate medicine.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think.
That another inscription through this disease.
She shared us with the message.
It's very important for everyone.
The first for us and then ...
It's a horrible thing.
The first message.
It was.
And when?
A child has leukemia.
The risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns.
Impossible.
Besides, don't get involved.
I enter in poop.
And that's not what we learn to analyze.
and spread it to our friends, to the most of the school.
For society, people on Facebook.
I'm really saying it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore.
The most important thing is life, fight for life and love.
The second message he had with this disease?
That's how the movement of ...
I was already a donor.
AS: That's it.
What is the person?
They see us as a family.
Heterossexual, my father.
It's not a family that loves, that embraces each other, that's the same as all these families.
AC: At the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men.
Or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be a family?
Or a father, you see?
Or a warmer divorce?
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease, for the world?
And what?
My blood, my oven mulla.
We can manufacture it.
Our favor.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human "podoar" for another human being.
Tankède raised this awareness.
We have this ability.
(Laughter) Dedoing.
"Sengue," for you to need, blood isn't just ...
For someone who has a house, I don't leave.
The blood is needed in the rooms.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everyone processes the need.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
I asked two.
And a ticket.
And one out of 6,000 people.
So, if you ...
You can save a life, it's as if you earned mega-mach.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when it reaches three.
It was a very beautiful moment of power.
I waited for them to move.
OK, I can save in life, yes, but fire.
No pain.
I'm donating a part of me.
To save in life, this is something.
More beautiful, and it's the message that ...
It's not like that.
What happens to all of us?
So I thank you all.
(Audience) Yes.
To support us, for this union we're not feeling, this unconditional support.
(Laughter) I'm not for the Kavid of Tankède.
In other words, to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superiores.
Thank you very much.
She adapted to me.
Pah-pah.
Almost you.
Be like you.
This is exalition.
Two.
My name is Pala-La del Chinaud.
"Your Syrian was born in Dama.
Capited from Syria.
And I, an engineer.
I studied at Damás University.
Today ...
It's a refugee story.
She said, "It's not like that."
With my family.
My language more.
It's great.
Arabic.
What?
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
VV: Today.
And I'll talk about this.
What bothers me the most.
"Broancês."
What's on Slam?
Because of terrorist groups.
What isn't there?
Nothing to do with that.
For me, that's it.
A “X of war.”
That is, it was beautiful.
It's trial.
NB: Yes.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was from Vinci.
Three million people.
GB: I had it.
My family.
My friends I knew.
From this child.
Three doors melted.
An Engineering Obscator.
These are two apartments.
I was chaos.
Try more.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
I'm going back.
"Yeah!"
AC: Like the United States.
Sbania.
Franco!
And until is it a day?
And the war started.
March 15.
In 2011.
AS: Wait.
Hi.
I arrive to all other cities.
(Laughter) In the country.
And my city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
There were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
Hi!
I'm five years of war.
This is my country.
It builds.
What do you see?
I know they were forced.
Carrica.
The hip.
Narrator: Of your children.
And they found.
His balls?
Swed and mutilated.
Audience: Good evening.
That's it.
Familiares.
Narrator: Samira?
And don't come back.
Better still!
The last "yes."
In Syria, it was very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did I start working?
I knew how to hear my family again.
Or not?
Hi!
(Laughter) Millions of Syrian.
They lowered everything.
And I was dead.
You took refuge in other countries.
And I'm my family.
"Ah, let's go!"
Very sad.
When should we leave Syria?
Well, I'm not the barantists.
And our life affects you.
Why?
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day.
My country.
My father, my brother.
I still live to talk.
And I don't know if I'll come to him.
In novelome.
Babrotege.
My family.
I went to Bahirut.
Hi!
Ten months.
And I knew that Brazil had opened the doors.
Or a Syrian paradox.
I talked to Baixada Brasileira.
Zero.
São Paulo.
It was the best city.
AC: Waiti.
AC: In Brazil.
Why?
And I had more opportunities.
I said, "Tedia Pinas."
Or a week?
Brading.
Bravo!
The air.
From my life?
It's started.
CF: Don't Brás.
I got here!
And in December 10?
I went in 2013, with my family.
I have two children.
Being angry?
11 years old.
With a lot, today.
I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara.
VR: No, come.
Not Brazil.
(Laughter) I made a party for how to live.
The opponent of my children.
And they were all talking.
Very well.
And from the food, that my good cough ...
They talked.
I say "abrovita."
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
to make food?
It was to sell.
Hi.
What did I create?
The webpage didn't do it?
The humidity of Syria, that's why now.
There's pen.
What is the snap?
I make food.
It's blind.
The noise.
We're happy in Brazil.
Then, thank you.
Evo, Brazil!
AG: You.
Seriously.
When the world...
It was closed.
CF: Bravo.
Because of war, it's about ...
Very good.
Better still.
"Hi.
It's yours.
I had a wrong idea.
Over the Syrian.
What is this?
Today, in the morning.
Or a journalist talks with me.
"Yes."
What happened?
France?
Now, I don't want to talk.
It's funny.
The contact.
A submarine.
A lot!
I "slam" likes blood.
Permitted by Mata.
Amazing.
From religion.
Exactly.
The opposite.
Or why?
What happened, the taxpay?
It was a "creming".
Don't stand in French.
Mom?
Branus.
The Syrian.
(Video) The state is dynamic.
Orgins like this.
All horrible.
What is emerging is Islam's image.
A religion.
I mean.
Alcool?
I'm not a book.
It's sacred since a person kills.
without having killed another one.
Themix with option on Earth is as if all men were killed.
MB: Life.
Is it how life deserves?
To all men.
Alcurão.
"Surray your, evil, berzopolo, thirty to two."
It takes all the pain.
They don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill: Muslims, soldiers.
How is it?
My life in Brazil?
He showed me.
That we can live in poop.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian.
And Brazilians.
Voz: Even with differences.
of culture.
It's religion.
When people see a woman using "hijabi"?
That handkerchief that covered my hair.
Anyway, my wife is my wife.
They ask, "How?
AC: Why do you use this silence with this heat?
You use it.
And if you read at home, how are you?
Aline Tirai Jabi.
Oislam has other roofs.
Men in Molière.
And not "bone" must be touched.
Getting and meditating.
It's sex just about you.
And the wedding.
Any berceau?
I wish!
But I've already seen some humans who do this.
All of this.
That beat is the hug.
(English) Look, the "lam" has these rules.
What else?
It's from every person wanting.
I finished.
Or not?
The bicycle is fine.
"Brob" some things to be.
Likewise, they have to be that they don't obey everything.
And it's not good.
It's not having been born as a pork can, in alcoholic drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Let's do it.
More than one.
The third one.
And that didn't happen to me.
Why?
Why?
And these things are proved.
And Islam.
Our religion.
And it's very important for us.
What else?
Although.
It's hard to get to know the coin.
AC: Later.
That the agency is explained.
People always understand.
What is this?
Or "Professor, Mohammedes."
Because we must respect.
All religions.
Because everyone has the same value.
That we should be true with all of us.
It doesn't matter.
No, you'd save the white man.
Negro.
(Video) (English) "Hi, how good.
that we should help the people who need it.
Every year we had Alsaacá.
AS: And we took it.
I do two.
Well ...
Five, for himself.
(Laughter) Anyway, I'm not an engineer.
And for people.
Mom.
Otherwise.
There's no company.
In other words, the poor are Muslims.
CR: Cristal.
Today, I did.
AC: And I invite you.
Spreading.
About Islam.
I'm sure.
It's a religion.
Now, my dream...
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
(English) Bara, it's over.
What do I know?
Better still!
SNC.
That's it.
Together in bar.
Raise your hand.
In the little histories of life.
They come to remove my tears, in the sun ships in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not take away the shots of those who expect always reach, those who believe they've always achieved, I don't believe, soon I lose hope.
But, in the daily label, I know who suffers, "the strength makes food," my salary ends, just like this race.
A girl, a girl, was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand any service opportunities, there was one hand.
Cozinheiro?
Fascinira.
Why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you take me so much to pay a Secretary course?
But it doesn't even enter the office.
Excuse me, as there was an event between the five.
to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
ME's CT, be a maid, if it were for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas.
Please, the man gave me an opportunity, and the teacher told me, "You follow this corridor, turn it off, turn it to the left."
Tell that cute that the vassor is hot, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and this year, it wasn't even completed four months yet.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed, I was at home.
Differences.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
And I was shouting there in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live next to the beach, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And, as I use Facebook as a daily basis, I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, "Menine, all you can do cigarettes, which is tomorrow, is my new diary."
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
I warned people, "Look guys, I came to remember, some reports, I'll start.
It's to bet on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid.
For this case, other people have already gone through this too, so compassionate, and it's easy for me to keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
For me, the surprise, in less than 24 hours, became very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story on the Internet, it was a reference to my last job as a maid in Santo city.
This is in 2009.
Yes, I was hired to be a cook?
And my boss prevented me from ...
My own food that I made, I had to bring the yesterday, I couldn't use her glass at home, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
What was the bathroom for houses?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionated this first story on the Internet, it went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, than everything.
Everything!
All of them got very excited when I started talking about the housing situation in Brazil.
They rebuilt each other, and I started talking about these stories, because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestications are more valued, they earn.
It's for time, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive many abusive advertisements in my page.
which gives employment announces that I've tried as abuses, for example, an advertisement I read.
P: It was for the worker.
And to work secondly.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 38 Brazilian reals.
A day, week, much less.
Sorry.
380 Brazilian reais per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions, today, there are domestications being prevented from feeding and they also don't earn food, there are domestications.
I couldn't use the bathroom and suffer all these atrocities.
That I've always mentioned on the website, but for these seven years, there were various stories of oppressions, but in a single house where I found something I call humanized treatment, Regina.
As soon as I got home, I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a room that had a gigantic library, and I always liked reading, lots of books, even today, cost a lot of money, and my household mother, my father and a wallet, I couldn't buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started stealing.
This became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, gathered everything quickly, left half an hour to clean, to TV.
(Laughter) And there he's sitting down, delicizing me with those books, and, to my surprise, Regina gets into the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and knowing the experiences I had experienced in the past.
I was very nervous, and she sat there with me and said, "What are you doing? I said,
I started to take little off here.
(Laughter) Then I got very nervous and she said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world."
Then she started to indicate several texts, which, in 2009, when I went to the university.
I got to read at the university too, so what I call humanized treatment.
In 2009, it was very difficult.
And to raise awareness in the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and several class friends who helped me, summary some texts.
I press to get into the room to show that it's very difficult to convey a very heavy job with the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the cassette of the traditional Brazilian family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first union of domestications, and she was known by the media as a terror of lords.
All of this when I eat and sponsor some reports?
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I've come here to generate adversity."
Because I believe.
It's only through the adversity that we can change some things.
No one will follow the path with a little stone.
Right?
Why?
It's the majority of workers.
Domestics in Brazil, 79 addicts to 6% according to the genius of 2013, they are black women.
What about that?
AC: It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a job like anybody, yes.
Fifty and three percent of the population is black too, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a maid, and I was also a maid.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I didn't understand, but she knew everything that happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, too.
I would also pass.
(Laughter) Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with picture and good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without hunger.
They called me at least an interview.
I'd take a shock, this after graduation, OK?
I took a suspense to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so on, and then are you?
Yes.
Hi, I'm magic.
And I always say that what was the big house in the past?
They are luxury apartments.
What people were.
domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very low to us.
They are the housemaid today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I would run away, hurt, and I was nervous.
What I waited for so long for her to come.
On Friday day of payment: I hear her entering the noise of the key.
Opening the door.
Wow, my boss came.
And when I get there...
I was already wearing the clothes to leave.
When she pays, then she arrives and speaks.
Mina was so short.
Wow, I forgot to get your money from Monday, I pay you.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
My girl, I created her since I was little.
Her mother would always work, and there wasn't much time for her.
But all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there.
I just wanted to see.
And she got married, that's it, but unfortunately they didn't invite me to marriage.
But, as I am deaf.
I put my best clothes.
I went to the church, I stayed there.
Didi!
And I saw my girl getting married.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
Tao.
I see the family of my bosses having fun, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
She's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because the modern Madonna.
It's almost the one from the maid.
And the moment of my life is when my boss will work.
He's going to work, he takes us to...
His wife at work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
And the house?
To hide me.
And the only solution I had was to get rid of.
Cools from all overcomes.
So, if I clean what?
I'm traffic.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I'm blank.
And that's how I can flee from his harassment.
I said, "What? What?"
I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Men, resist."
They moved in 186 to the same.
I'll gain this value somewhere else."
Here we resist.
Because I also left my children in Northeast.
They need these jeans.
Because modern Madonna ...
What is the maid's destiny?
I just arrived at a new service.
And I brought my little glass pot.
Because my deaf pot is my little Pininho.
And there's "Stave."
GB: In service rooms.
Expertated, pee.
My little CVT pot.
That's it.
And my boss saw it, I was very ...
"Cada!"
She started to cry and said, "Why me?
The savan poin uses the bathroom, "What's happening?"
What kind of bathroom can I use?
No, because in the other homes I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the maid bathroom, that's why I brought little.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
Today I'm here.
Contrarians and seasons.
For some people, in my place, it would be in front of me.
Because, when I told my boss, I wanted to study ...
Do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
"Menine, you have to be.
They tell you.
What are they?
His grandmother wasn't a maid?
Only the mother wasn't a domestic age, she was already predestined to her family.
So, you have to be.
Being here, so I'm here, would tell you about statistics.
Woman?
Correct?
(Laughter)
Hi, my name is mine.
Different.
Black woman, fat.
Professor, peripheral and retil.
The side!
I'm alone here.
Behind me, there are 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they would be...
What can I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But it's only about seeing that six million houses are being represented now.
And many of them aren't listening to me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there.
Impacting?
That's what I want to provoke in this moment.
Why?
Everything!
Four years, come.
There are four of them and some houses.
What if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships?
We'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, there are many houses.
They work and study.
And here, this housework has a private property, we can see in aeroports: Why does the nanny have to be dressed as white?
It's an uniform to be able.
Have you understood?
And to stay at home, don't the boss know she's the nanny?
But no, it's to be clear which places some people have in this country are.
So, I'm here contrary to life.
AC: I'm not alone.
That's it!
"Yes, yes.
I'm here today to talk to you.
Overview ...
Silence.
What's already a bit funny to go out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
At the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
You connect your cell phone.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying and fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you serve.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did the acid start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then, pain doesn't stop.
And he turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
No, too.
And I said, "There."
At almost 30 years of game, I meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I was.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
It opens the agenda.
Take your eye.
It's insecurity and equipment.
I place inflammation points.
First passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
And when the pain went to the next level.
And I was sure that I wouldn't realize it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From that chaos ...
In this situation?
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a present state.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Within this feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment you are not.
The consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
GG: You are you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you're not wrong.
You don't have beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was very scary.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a great nest.
[A.DE.]
They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was.
Everything I'd already lived.
AS: Tava.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Right now, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
Just keep it.
Several of you?
Think about it.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance here, so now I'd really want to challenge each one of you.
Put your cell phone off because all of you have.
Miauça.
AG: You all have a cell phone.
We turn it off.
You connect, come this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phone?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor?
What about it?
AC: Here, close your computer.
You with the lettuces close them.
And you who were noticing notebooks, closed their notebooks for a moment.
With everything.
To be honest, you are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
The lack of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at your foot.
Look back.
Look at me.
(Audience) Look.
For São Paulo.
What about it?
Look at the other human being that you have on the right and left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
And you're fine, you won even a veil.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
You see where you are.
They saw it.
Do you see?
"Yes."
Do you see?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Both legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that's born.
It's fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not that guy in front of you, because this guy is now with much more fear that you all gather.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
I said, "Sure, this can!"
And a good space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember this area.
Two dimensions closer to the room.
In this university, in Porto Alegre, remember that you are in the building, in the south of Brazil.
And in America she had it.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting.
The space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you have it.
That you don't have it.
Four sense of management.
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Surely of you.
It was wishing.
Do you know where you are and leaving the localization system connected?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember when you were kids?
Do you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Seriously.
And apply the space localization system.
Your minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take care of this action.
They see the area to occupy.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What fits the area that you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
AA: It's not strange.
And it's not difficult.
It's new.
Like it's new, equality.
It's new, since it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
The city tells that much of what we do is determined by what we've already lived.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
The silencing?
And a state of presence that comes from it and can become.
A habit in our lives.
These are technologies.
self-awareness, which are there.
In the planet.
Together with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
And all of them.
Are you available?
They're simple.
But these are spinning technologies.
Great generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDx?
I thought, "It's passionate.
For a TEDx talk.
What reaches the first video?
It's usually the first life.
A fire.
(Video) I can say that I'm an absolutely tough tradition.
The walls are so sedutive.
What is the idea of translated?
I had a demand for a TEDx fan region.
What did you ask to enter society?
It was time to share.
(End of video) With your friends, your colleagues.
Isn't it?
It's all big in the case.
The translation work.
This is fundamental.
It's once it's worth it.
Five percent of people according to behavior.
Five percent of them have an English influence.
How is it like that?
The producer is the key.
And possible?
Opening a door, this case of sphere launched.
For millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
And translating to 16 and 16 in young people.
And, almost all the time, 6,000 translations made to everyone.
But we not only translate.
They also transcend.
The talks made in events.
Audience: Hi.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our ideas.
Audience: Yes.
But it's clear to allow people a hearing impairment.
And I can follow.
content.
Transparate.
When is the talk given in English?
And it was my case here, besides the Portuguese.
The first was transcribed.
(Laughter) Two young people.
To then be verified by my time and from English, it's that it's translated to learn more language.
Because, initially?
TED, with its own hot logope.
I only put it as a TED technology, "intrortinely," which is "e," which we can translate as a fun.
AS: And having blood?
I referred to São Paulo.
Nowadays?
The talks.
They remember the inferiority of subjects that go from excellent topics on political literacy, businesses, entrepreneurship, and literature.
We have talks, for example.
Follow your chance works.
And another of my passions.
Seeing what is necessary.
The issue is only this accident.
MA: Yes.
"Who?"
The horrible time we have, then not only for our greatest expectation of life.
It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout people.
I think it's clear that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
I'm like this.
Why think?
And realize how I look at it.
(Audience) Thank you.
It's an axis of a finger.
And it can be.
And the "selfies" talks, TEDx.
His serians are short educational voices.
"Do you know what you want to do?"
MA: Very small.
And I do this.
Not just that.
Because translating is a passion and the country is also a strict word in my life.
(Laughter) Not only because a pleasure of translating these talks is a "sedex," but being "trox" is inside.
And not only because I learn a lot with them.
And here there was a group of translators.
It's a privileged reader.
(Laughter) It's not only that helps me deal with my society, only a anxious person, not only delicious, sometimes I say that I'll translate only half an hour and hours per radiation, two three hours went by, that happens to me in conduction.
And not only because I had fantastic people.
And he started getting to know how to receive.
The person stretched.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth it.
(Laughter) I use my cognitive precedent.
In initiatives like this one.
And what is it?
The philosopher, "Hey?
I answered, "Princi, it's probably a girl."
Music.
What about TOC?
What is empowering.
Because I don't have everything to go home.
It's good for that.
That's the joke, what is it?
It's yours.
My emerging movies.
With few crimes, two excluded to our society.
Can I insert?
in a dignified way in our lives.
And when is it a fish, do I work to fight?
(Laughter) I think it's a donation work.
What does acid have?
I was afraid of Arthur.
What if we put on an object?
Just like that.
Volunteer.
Because he always chooses mine.
They're worms.
I have to do it.
There are also two ways.
Impressing to commit myself.
(Laughter)
The time when the Sun ...
It's different from donating.
The shadows.
Respits.
So these are complex activities.
It takes not only to know it.
I was strange for myself.
The main question said, especially.
"Wow!
And renovation.
What does this play?
behind a very violent translation.
There's always.
A part of knowledge has time.
Why?
Audience: Hi.
(Video) Woman: Thank you.
Diver.
And behind, a translation without?
"Hey, to be crazy, bei?"
There's always a great worst distress.
What frustrated with the future?
PC: Even better.
Because you do it, it can always do in the best.
Why do I have it?
It can be improved.
What do you mean by defining?
And here I need to remember -
Because most of our volunteers ...
It's not a professional, it's very important to decide.
Work higher.
Audience: Yes!
To think?
We created for the quality of our solutions.
Not only about the speaker, but not respecting someone.
And to guarantee this?
(Laughter) All things.
Traduations and transitions.
For a review, made by exchanges, I'll fight.
It finally stood out.
They are served by language.
Have you got a coordinator in a neighborhood?
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
In the case of...
They were Brazilian Portuguese, that we arrived in Portugal's Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ...
♪ Invisible.
It's six, parents would like her.
The treaty is xilominene.
I said, "Stories.
We have six months.
We have Maricena.
Claudia.
Why me?
MA: We have the sun.
Bye, bye.
What are potatoes?
OK.
Gustavo.
Are you mine?
Just a few.
What thousand cars leave?
The world!
That's it!
obsession.
Because if I have an education...
MA: Isn't it necessary?
Menina: I was listening?
AC: Not only.
How is Brazil?
What does the home live?
(Laughter) A deep, political crisis, in war, education is released.
Five years ago.
(Laughter) But without it, with my exchange in personal history.
My father.
What would be of two years now if it were said?
GG: But the last speaker, what else?
Nevertheless, I knew how to write very well and do the four mathematics programs very well.
His dream was to always be able to study beyond because I'm studying.
and ask how many children submit.
That's why what was living in our neighbor from Minas called "Tairobeiras."
It was decided to change for her four children of the time that I paid a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
And, on some sides, my father arrives instead of his beginning, his logic is their finger, and his place.
(Laughter) He also established, with the merchant, he, from a small hotel, had a presence store, had an impression.
They're not.
In 1964.
I took a great reession to Brás.
Because of this exception, and other reasons, my father went to the lack and lost.
"Oh, I'm what's good?"
Ooo!
(Laughter) He stayed literally without anything in what you kill in your old furniture.
One felt very humble with his clown in economic, and my father decided.
And after paying your debts?
If you change bedrooms like a front or behind you, do you eat really enjoyed?
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who is now 90 years old, isn't deaf.
Besides being an expectation in Paráito's game, still today.
It was not knowing how to get it.
(English) Your training fusion, my life.
And she decided to take queijo bread.
So, for many years, at home ...
(Laughter) Same queijo was literally winning a stage, saying these passages of the biggest pedagogy landscape.
"So? What do you mean?
Audience: Yes.
Even though we don't have to eat many times, we don't have what to dress.
One thing, my father didn't open his hand.
That's what we were.
to study.
And that's how it works.
Hi, guys.
The big one, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by Agassa, domicilios.
In the 48-year-old crossing, in Brazil's 60s?
Only 32% of people with greater solidarity than me.
(Audience) Good evening.
Why?
Or what except this fascination, this passion my father had for education?
What did they look like?
SP: I don't know us.
My father, for example, had Alávitus in Peló.
AG: Standing.
When I was 17...
At that time, we would remove the alphabety of the sky.
When they finished, they thought, "Where's the chest to the monzone, there's a remedy, the premature needs it to appear at home."
You can't act, right?
(Laughter) "Hi, I'm coming in.
And by exchanging in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest household show.
But for my father, she would check her there, napping.
(Laughter) No knowing.
And they were living a little bit about this talk.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) My five brothers and I managed to overcome it, but we got more than that today we managed to give to ours.
(Laughter) How many better dreams than the ones we've had, and here I tell you the greatest passion in my audience's life is my two kilos: Daniel, and João Inghan.
My parents never put it to my chair to have a newspaper for me.
(Laughter) But for those I questioned all mothers.
His stories to studies?
(Laughter) So, adventure was always a pleasure for me.
And of course, my stories.
Coincident, isn't it coincidence?
Four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is being one to be.
At some point in physics.
And one of the brothers is the educator without absolutely anything.
To change.
And I thought.
(Laughter) In ideas, to be revolutionary.
Because it's applied in students' education to their own school.
Chorus: Here.
The only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, an obsession, we have to be.
Men based on education.
Despite the adverse conditions, despite developing our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our time.
And my passion for initiatives is TED?
It has to do exactly.
By the fact that TED, just like my father, his simple way, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by them.
And, speakers, marvelous.
I said, "A TEDx talk.
(Audience) Nuria, inspire.
And then, fail the idea.
What make us believe.
Let's think?
We are.
Our aunt, our voice, is dry.
It was with her that I had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explain how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols.
And then they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super-conplicated, it's that I'm forgoing this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
And I started writing letters from dots on my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times.
And I stopped buying a rule.
Because it's a little girl that allows you to describe in arms.
AC: On the street, you write that shows the relief.
And I ended up letting my notebook.
And how about acting?
I say, "Letragy music, name and gym" or "my."
I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threw me up, in which I wrote to her that I was learning, that gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Santa Cruz, and we thought that maybe the army could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
And we decided that it's a clock where it could feel the time.
We started to research, there wouldn't be thousands of processes like this, we'd go online, we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
The most saw there was no Internet.
We decided to create our own.
We started to research, learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and try to create a clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines.
The kidneys would show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaked and nothing happened, but we did it write everything, disconnected and reconnected everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock.
And we showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
And he really encouraged us to continue this project, to try to make a small report, a translator in Braille, was very exciting.
Every process we went through, knows a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
and use them so that they could change the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help only in inclusion, and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple, they haven't yet been created.
What if we, two students in high school, didn't even finish?
In high school, we are second year, and we are teenagers.
We managed to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done.
To help.
Let's ask you the second question.
What do you think?
There are adult people.
In a free, consent.
They can have sexual relations.
In other words, with other adult people.
You can put your hand.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
AC: Or in sexual work.
What is an expression I prefer?
The only difference, the main difference.
In other words, with sexual relations that dance commercial.
It's a motor trade.
In other words, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the goal of mourning.
So, and another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people with fire.
And I know some hundreds.
Men.
Children and women.
that manage their business autonomously, they publish their ads.
We received their clients.
In the department?
In Noteis.
AC: Or you have thoughts.
Right.
And nobody has to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases involved.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
I hope it's around 16 years old.
Or adults who didn't make sense to their consent?
Are they crisis cases?
These are cases that must be harassed.
Therefore, criminal and judicially.
And I said, "What? What?"
What is Linquante?
They must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of prostitution.
The institution of adults who are forced, who is consistent, I also think it's a criminal case.
volunteer prostitution and frustration.
It doesn't come to talk about tragic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse this situation.
According to sexual execution.
But to take all the people who do prostitution by traffic victims for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
Research has shown us.
It's in Portugal.
The traffic phenomenon.
One of the two sexual proportions is very precise.
In fact, they're phenomena.
It's what we identify, but that can be crossed.
And to give you a notion.
What I've just told you about here the phenomenon doesn't need.
Let's give the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism.
What's in Portugal gathered information about the issues related to traffic.
And that's relatively the year 2016, the latest available data.
It indicates that 108 traffic victims were confirmed in Portugal.
Human.
Almost all of us for job exploitation?
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
To justify an action.
A police officer.
What doesn't justify is that there's all an email speech.
What are unpleasant from reality?
It's an image in a very historical way regarding prostitution.
Many times people take all the people here.
That's it.
As victims.
It happened a lot.
It's stressed.
This is an object that waits for someone.
I wanted the salvation well.
And this doesn't respond to reality either.
Or is it just another foreign?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities.
Therefore, inequalities only be cultural.
We know there's a diversity.
Commitment.
That influence the decision we make.
But when do we talk?
When we interviewed, when the meeting entered.
"Social researcher interacts!"
Conversely, I'm with people who do sex work.
What they tell me is that this was an option.
In other words, a hidden option.
Then, related to advantages.
It's a disadvantage.
which is to enter an activity that is profitable.
I think it's alright too.
I was a jewish, and it's not recognized.
If I ask you.
That you think what is the image that comes immediately to you.
The mind.
It's when you think of a person who prostitates.
Think about it.
Okay?
I bet most of you thought of two situations.
But or in any score?
Or a woman?
That's why I'm not scared.
It was and a mini-scale.
It's in a corner, in a dark street.
VR: From the city.
which is very likely the causa-personous Batox.
Absolutely.
There's someone in the mirror.
But this is just...
These are just two stereotypes.
These are simplified images.
What don't you reflect with rigor?
It's reality.
There's diversity.
Very big!
Of people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
of practices?
One of the experiences.
Not everyone has positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences.
and a life trajectory.
They are not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I say that the studies that are actually the distance.
And society identifies itself.
And try to stimulate their number.
People who take the beginning of sex indicate that...
It's called Sindroe.
Let's do it.
Well, we are close to BESAB.
It's not possible.
In total, people prostitute themselves.
When we think of a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
It's just measurements.
But they're not an intelligence.
Let's study it.
It was done here in Portugal that had a bigger sex worker friend, a study led by a single-day teacher.
I'm in Lisboa past.
And that interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context and in context.
Inner, men, women, trans people.
and that all over the country.
And they found 10 victims 2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of the man or the oppressor.
They forget it's a percentage of men who are here.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here.
I like Portugal recently.
(Laughter)
AS: Although it may appear.
And I said, "Ah...
An idea.
Apparently humanist.
When it is analyzed at the bottom, it realizes that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work.
And that's the idea of the criminalization of the colleague.
Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
Prohibited, selling sex.
"This is 'crime' to buy one.
The idea is that it's at the base.
This law.
It's that people in prostitution are victims.
His beginnings.
And so, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law was already adopted in other patents after Sweden.
And the Sweden government has talked about a remote about the great success of trafficking of this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there has been very strong evidence.
That's why, specifically, non-profit organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they indicate that this law puts more stream.
That's why sex taste themselves put rich healthy trees in their own dry wisdom.
And that increases your vulnerability.
Violence.
The stigma.
And the disease.
Another idea we have is that everyone.
that this is the idea of all people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
"Hmm."
It's an idea like this.
I know that, without great inspiration in Piche, people's resources happened well, people's speeches.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea I think is ideologically biased.
Even because research has shown that the lessons, people.
Studies workers.
I don't know.
And your clients?
These are complex relationships and, mainly, we are abusive relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is unpleasant.
who are the people.
Because they are disabled porters.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
"I know I'm taking it."
It's a bad right.
They are people with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality.
It's your pleasure.
And many of them, the person can do it.
Changing the job.
Even country?
What has a legal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is, "Whoever receives a traine."
to know how to have sexual relations.
They are people with disabled people.
I think this is what it means.
This is quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
It's about the relevance of sexual work.
And now that it's tested at any moment that I try.
What is favour?
It's the name of the clients' criminalization.
"So? What do you mean?
I said to him, "If people.
You can do this as an option.
What if people think about them?
It's the best option at that moment in your life to make it easy.
To your own.
And there are economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
What did he find about work connections?
No, if this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
To condemn it so strongly the people who do sex work.
Why is stigma so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Yes ...
Because of morality.
And specifically, moral.
Sexual.
So, that Ihibited sexuality in two.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality considered.
That's right.
It was normal.
And natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" and consider them legitimate.
It's normal.
It's anti-natural and that's where the start of the sky was located.
And the fact that the beginning of being considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization.
In other words, of social rejection, of decreidibilization, of health, of disvalorization of people who do this activity.
A stigma.
This is a iron mark, a despite.
The stigma that rejects sex observators is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes.
stigma is a form of violence.
This is based on so much discrimination about dry wisdom.
How, for example?
It's when they drive into institutions in the area of action.
That's why justice and social security are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, "No TEDxBas," "The stigma of puta."
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The defense that we can drive a woman calls her puta.
The stigma of the puta followed women in two.
The honor and the helplessnesses.
Seriously and non- seriously those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's the most.
It's an instrument.
What's the use of?
This control of feminine sexuality is a kind of spada of bitteries.
Because it's above any of us' minds.
And any woman ...
They had sexual behavior.
Devast, norms that I read about socially described.
It crossed.
The duty of being required by a puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
Wait!
Why do I think we can do anything, can we do it?
(Laughter) So it doesn't continue.
to disrespect sex players.
And what?
I think the path is the human rights rights.
Every day, including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not built policies.
From ideological assumptions.
TB: And Timba?
Let's start the fool.
Like a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the offendation.
It's to challenge stigma, as I'm here to do right now.
And to give voice.
Listen to sex workers.
give voice to a group.
It hasn't been.
Audience: Oh!
from the most attempts.
The most vistentative silencing things over time.
The recorders of the century.
So, everybody, organized and used 70.
But, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility.
Now, we're eager.
AC: Don't be told, we don't want compassion or tolerance crimes, we want rights.
That's what I think we have to follow.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it was the title.
What is natural that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize.
And to criminalize the wisdom.
Thank you very much.
MB: Love.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Artigo, well cured, art, healed from being a doctor.
It is supported by a fundamental stone.
Narrator: Thank you.
What about fear?
This is the relationship.
It's much from him.
Where am I inside?
It's to involve myself, spiritually, it's the way I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion.
"Why did I give you that?"
But at the same time, I have to have a distancing of such that allows me to have a TEDx rigor.
There's a technical judgment that, so I can propose.
The best treatment for that day.
This balance is far from him.
What do I do?
It's an officer and more wrong.
I was in balance, OK?
And in the last ten.
They have more Amazon.
It's five times.
Cirure.
As soon as I followed many doctors.
They were also there.
Divers times.
When did we get there?
AC: In ours.
The arrogance lost.
And I thought I would bring something to him.
But I didn't wear India.
The Mitis Indian.
And that's it.
Because I wouldn't have since then.
It's a rational woman.
Someone who needed my empty knowledge.
And to be able to offer that person?
That involvement, that love, that act.
There...
Hello?
All the doctors who go with us are focused on that.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice.
The simplification that's there.
Is it possible?
and replicate that.
It's the small research itself and, in the middle of the Amazon, it's for all of this.
It was the path I found to cover.
How nice!
Here at the beginning of a medical university.
If you make a list of topics of goals, is it all student?
The first goals are there.
Altruded.
He's gone well.
AR: On these same students.
And in the symbol of medicine class, with the same research.
But the signs are successful.
It's knowledge, healing.
Something we did is mistake.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant stigma.
And we handed someone standing up.
He knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
I didn't know.
They say, "No, from such a father, right?"
Isn't it?
This was to make a revolution.
We do it.
I just finished one thing.
Why?
What happens?
Feel the father in medicine because he has the first time.
He had a method?
That's how to teach.
Reproduced, replicate.
And to give it a way here.
And what?
The involvement of these people had a store.
A bank?
It's from poop juning.
Today I am...
It was made a fifth statute before.
I'm in a door.
That's it.
And why?
She said, "It's just to see the building of the patients."
Elected all the volunteer and corruption.
Especially the seduation of women, men, children and the brain.
And it became.
Especially.
Does it?
Are they or outside of them?
And don't convince you to be from Google.
(Laughter) To save this milk.
Like a religious secret.
And if I respect this jury, I didn't hear it there.
Being an equality and reputation between men and all times.
And I took it, a violent turn.
Who gives me this account?
Few.
I said, "Ah!
What I dealt with this and still today we do anticipation.
We do judgement of things we thrive.
Why do you have to go back?
Because the patient's relationship is essential for a good thing.
What happens?
VV: Today.
Few things are recorded for honor judgement.
And, in this case, I have a honor of...
So, it's taken for judgment.
Knowledge.
There is no aggression.
One day?
It didn't make science.
Prova couldn't go further.
What's going on?
This medical feeling that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable.
It could absorb all things.
So, today, the patient has one ...
A doctor's team that takes care of him.
As a group, and this group, each one is taking care of a little bit.
Audience: Yes.
We're going to specialize a lot, ignored before.
And it will lose.
"Ah! I don't know
I don't know.
A current theory that says to the exam, can say to the patient, "You can't, no.
Once I was in class, in college, in class.
Why?
Professor.
Audience: Yes.
Why?
MB: Yes, oh.
There's a resonating tomography, and it's how we copy the illustration.
If I focus their hands on their belly, they wouldn't be awareness faces.
The guy builds.
So let's call it for one thing.
Let's see the belly.
Is it wrong?
Bure.
And he showed that he had.
Men, right?
And 12, you can go.
And he said, "OK."
OK?
You're focusing on the patient and you'll have a moment of intimacy.
You can remember something.
If all this doesn't convince...
Besides, I saw.
You're seeing the patient.
"You're here exposing to you."
"Are you really?"
And right now?
We have an opportunity to speak not verbally for that.
And be careful with this.
You're feeling like reading because you want to do good, he's asking good, they're for him.
Let me take care of us.
This is this magic.
It's not only beautiful for your child, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, they improve faster and have a decovering curve.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases, our middle, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no anitâneas change, no routines, you can't see anything, diseases have symptoms.
And this happens: does it happen because it's our society?
Some of you have already raised the book.
It's very interesting to talk about her relationship.
Why?
But to be a patient, a patient, and to be passive, to those who are saying this to me.
Because you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
Because, after all, relationship actors are not doctors.
We left us.
We can think there are two hours.
He has doctors and bills donate.
It's time for us to stop and we have to be here.
"Yes."
And it's patient, patient.
And we have to hold our hands, which was in our cure process, and it's not just going to look for healthy life.
And, moreover, to engage in your healing process, in the decisions that was brought.
What do you do?
The first one?
The most important climate is information.
And not where I'm talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, is not fashionable. When I was a child, there were mothers with size pieces in my house, medicine and health.
I had a book, a health book, and that always existed.
The difference is that, at that time, for you to meet someone, publish something, because it's a publishing editor. (Laughter) If you had to have content to talk, today, a Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them are very good and very important, a lot with it.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see information first.
First.
Today's information is usually signed.
And I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me an enormous debate because people inside there hear what I did, what I studied, and they allow for nothing, that didn't say bad, what this puts me.
And just like other people who are defending personal interests, making money, selling medicine or other things like this.
JS: Yes.
The graduation.
The second very important thing.
You don't believe in good things, refrigerators outside, medicine changed, now your problems ended, seriously sweet.
Differently a conscious lab will have a recovering and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow it's on the Internet and my more, when I don't know it, put it there.
Third.
If we have a half paranoic thing?
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) But the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
Are you based on which information dominates?
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me, it's not for not to present.
And for a long time.
Take the information, discuss your method.
And what's there for that?
In the greatest knowledge, information and information, it's knowledge.
Take the information, participate in your cure.
Second important thing to be a national activist.
In such a cure process.
Ask them exist.
To know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
If you have a right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital."
The guy doesn't have time to care for me, I work alive.
I know it's.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change.
Wow!
That's it.
But demanding is not to get there to the fight.
He failed, isn't it?
"OK! Let's do it."
Fortunately, are you seeing?
to compost with time.
What do they do?
Because careers are different.
What do you want?
And he's the loss of...
What do I want?
They want to attend an hour.
And once?
In Venezuela, near Venezuela, it seems very anxious, isn't it?
We had a patient there, who had cancer.
Humour.
JJP: Yes.
There wasn't even an orologist for us.
São Paulo.
It's treating.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow.
Thank you very much.
They went, they didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German.
I had a translator, the neighbor's son who spoke a lot about Portuguese, how bad it was.
And he was obviously assaulted.
What do I do?
For example, it was.
For me ...
I'd give you a scene.
(English) "An Indian, please."
And you like that.
Isn't it?
Because I'm trying to say.
It's that, at that moment, magic happened.
What an individual?
Without speaking the language without having a completely different culture.
He handed his soul, that other individual, who was all interested in taking care of.
It's this magic.
Because it's the art of well-being.
Thank you very much.
EA: At that moment?
A needle of happiness that has doctors, has already...
Pocks in ambulants.
I said, "I'm."
Audience: Yes.
What am I doing?
Being there, in good light.
We're attending it.
MA: We, elderly.
We can try.
The most unity of our treatment.
It's more guilt.
That's it.
Try to be active in your cure process.
Why is it not to do this by each connection, "Looking the world will be better and you'll be more invented."
They started with the world here: 35 years old.
What happens to have this money?
This number is the number of decisions of human beings take for?
They make a decision every two seconds.
GB: And the person?
Two.
Despite having a decision.
Now, we need to pay attention.
He talked about decisions I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of seeing the world of decisions.
My grandmother changed her taking stories.
The experiment was done with this School magazine.
The murders of the magazine had three emotions in this nature.
AC: A digital nature with 59 dollars.
This depressive magazine nature comes from the oil cycle.
What is a statistics that is the digital people more company.
Because knowing if it's fictional.
The result of this first.
It's that it's the majority of people.
He chose the goal.
The brain in five dollars.
Because I like these experiments a lot.
So, there are some of these missing statements.
For a second group.
It was just an exhibition, two options.
GB: A digital option, 58 players.
GG: Evolution of the way with the executors as well.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to think that this notion of the middle of developed beings is a press notion.
What did nobody choose?
What did this option change, most people chose the new one?
And that left me very unpleasant.
Why would I want to overcome and make this decision?
And I started to study about it.
I'd like a lot about this and discovered that these people measure their name.
She replied.
As you don't want to go back, it's not an action.
influence this Dr. They make a decision or another decision.
I learned a lot about this in my terror called Economy and Computamental.
For theory, there is one of the cognitive conversations, which is neuroscience applied to decision-making.
I wanted to give a formula like this, interesting, you must study.
I had spent two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the choice to have.
You already like the same to see.
If you're an email from her, do your honey to be better, for whom I'll always pay and we study today.
AC: Not always.
AC: If I can have the disease.
This is impressive because I started to ask myself why it's all about it.
And a TED talk that even made me understand.
Let's stop making a comparison.
These behaviors were they before today.
I think everyone looks like an old problem.
The symbol of users and it seems a little bigger than the blue symbol of the whole year.
Why?
Because I have around me.
Actually, the team comes from the black fire.
Let's give it the autonomous centers.
But we see it differently, because I have around influencers.
There's another option of optics because I was fascinated by coming.
What is this here?
It seems that we're crying from above.
They are equal to chess and lower pieces.
It's in my life that will do a lot.
The problem of Homem Gadget is all that.
But I'll show you that it's the same.
It's horrible.
This is just a background editor.
We see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, it's my intense way.
What makes some sense to say that we have around us.
The same way the term evolves, the way we see doubts.
What's around us is also the development of all the decisions.
Travel doesn't have technology.
I didn't know where I would avoid working in a project.
to create an app through it.
He told me, "If we want to be happy."
It's a lot of option and life won't be explored.
You can choose this illustration of the dream.
It's strange, it's this and two.
And he won't be old, insecure.
Because we were working and they said that 500 km of possibilities of choice.
And then, what was working was, "OK, I run the way."
And yes, to yell the teacher's school.
This way, it was effective in another profession.
Maybe in your stomach.
I'd say these three.
I don't know.
(Video) (English) If you are the first clinic, he sees these three options.
It was then fighting for them to be like the concept of Economics magazine.
The third event is the person.
They make the drawing of the architecture of decisions, today I'm walking in decisions.
And that caught my attention.
In the world of technology, there's even the name of this profession called YOET.
And the entrance exams are the experience of the eyes.
(Video) (English) I don't know what to do.
And they are the architects of the decisions, working with the decision-making architecture, drawing all the forms and environments where all these men are.
Why do I look like a friend of mine?
We can find a day with this gift.
His face is the person who's a burden in this subject of behavior economy, and he looked at this photo and said, "Look what I found here isn't cold."
And I told him, these people who are at risk of bringing the knowledge of the behavioral economy to the digital world, and he said, "I'm overwhelmed and want to start with you on Youtube is harmful."
And there will be a vaccine of air crash.
What really changed my renovation of seeing.
Good afternoon everyone.
I think we don't need research to know that we use the cell phone a lot.
Everyone warned from teacher Lagogoz, or outside her pocket, looked at him, but she came to a research in Brazil that he has a competition.
And do you have some search for the people who have a smartphone?
They were outside things for 22 hours.
Uber.
Let yourself lose you and be able to get them with Helen Moore.
All these 35,000 decisions we make.
How many of you think they are digital decisions?
During these days, they established this regitor Rosa, nano and digital Internet, or that allowed people to be in the world.
I started to ask myself about this.
Can this horizon be like Jean-Dessoa?
It interested in this decision, how I am.
Will everybody change?
We said, "Of course I'm this."
The ex-sistor of the way for us to say, "Can the bathroom begins to act, isn't it the elite the name of this man?"
AC: And how are these decisions from him, shouting power?
The World Cup needed to take.
Is that it?
(Applause)
In those years?
Talking about Dougramas, I should talk to you about another interesting way.
It's the number that gives Austria, it's 91%, and in Argelia Amada, it's Equada with C.
You must have wondered what I thought was this and said, "It's the number that has to be free."
Disappeared?
It's a number of two young people.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does the highlight have 90?"
They are all the two of the region.
(English) What in Austria is already a doctor.
You need to ask to leave.
Narrator: Narrator?
You don't need to ask for a prize?
What's the first one?
It's called "defol."
This word is what you already have.
Not doing anything.
SP: Yes, I was sixth.
The decision is to catch birth, you need to ask to leave.
People have already took this picture for you, you have to go there and come out.
He's putting credit on my cell phone and segia.
There are two options: one survived the recipes.
And another one for me to receive.
Ressigo said,
What did she do?
So someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to go.
Duilai.
What to get out disappeared from the offer and came out of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened it ...
I was there of breastfeeding so I could take it.
This is not asking me to leave if I really was.
I thought it was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver.
What do they know?
And then, a truck from Uber once tells me a story.
Here is a lady.
He chose.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
And he looked strange.
"So there's another façades, man?"
He looked at her and said, "That's it, he chose.
Audience: Yes.
MA: It's curious.
Then I chose the business without even knowing.
She chose what was already chosen per year.
It's very good.
This is very interesting, we can imagine who's happening.
AC: If we go to Google today, do we need people's comedy?
It has 5.67,000 results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first country page.
Who's chosen a place where we went to eat from people was myself?
After this...
What I do: do I go there and click on the page?"
I love the page seven, and I see there what has the page not: "I'm on the web page."
Just to ask her.
And I wanted Google.
It's Uber giving us little pants.
AC: These littleorns, English, have a name in the behavior economy, also have a name.
They're called Christmas.
It's not just a little push in English.
I'd like to ask you to be empty the person next to you.
We don't understand.
(Audience) So, everything.
Is it?
So this is "no."
There is a theory.
NJ: Yes.
Dr. Chimado Richard Teiler has a book called Nães.
Audience: Yes.
The concept of 'digital' isn't it?
That's what I gave.
In a simple way of understanding these nests in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me.
Now he has it.
I thought, "I want an adult.
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a photo of my important view.
They are thinking that only the one who's falling on this is European.
It was Australia here at UFES.
AC: Everyone here has received an e-mail.
CF: From confirmation.
AC: In that environment I had.
And written: "When you apply in a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions."
that you will take in your life.
Luis Pica.
If you don't want a CD, it's easy to stay in this book.
"Excuse me!
How many people have dealt with?
In other words, more than 400 inscribed people.
And 13 people were left here.
So, this means that I get all the decisions of life.
Three hundred and 170 conversations.
No, that was just an experiment.
This is one of the things I do.
I do this experiment to understand how people behave.
And I change the result.
What do people ask me?
To have this knowledge.
AC: Sorry guys.
Of those grades.
This can do because we manipulate someone.
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to make someone buy, it's something they don't need.
So you can use good things.
How, for example?
You can use it.
to make a daily patient standing up ...
Stop with the moment, this is the most insulin life.
Or can you use it?
AC: To avoid truck accidents, like this ballet, at the same time, what media does.
From cereal waves to detect coxilo to avoid a city.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
And there's an event that happened in 2016, which did with what?
People from the world describes.
44 billion phases.
What do you imagine?
Well, that's it.
The launch of Pokémon.
Because "mong" is a game.
And it brings theona, the concept of reality is increased.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of augmented reality, of virtual reality, too much learning.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
What if we understand better?
And how do these hoods exist?
Ladies.
How do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more conscious.
so that we make better decisions.
