AC: How is the cost of disabled people?
What if there's any difference?
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everything.
AC: People with whom?
AS: And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress? Is there any difficulty in putting clothes, does it need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that would meet their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play, outside that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived.
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other disabled women, and I made her a calmness with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort, which made a discreet to make her exchange in the son, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other uncle, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a whip opening on her shoulders, with pressure button shuts, to facilitate, when she passes her head, in fact, for people.
They are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a room that facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic.
That idea, autonomy, so that person can dress alone.
AC: In this last fashion that I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a seat.
I've already done her in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, so she could identify that the play would be that one used during the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
And, for women, with anism or low status, the ideal.
It's thinking of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore, in the child's children session, imagine clothes with reasons of princess and cut them off.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses and more technological products.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana?
(Laughter) And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their collections.
What was already in its second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first, that large companies, famous and designed brands, who realized the real need of this dressed room, and are already launching inclusive collections.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
What about the world?
What is changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family always came from the rock.
AC: I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life?
(Laughter) Aren the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
He went to work with the children.
Listening of four years old.
Until adolescence, and goes by adult, "My community, do we start working with the day?
And I was consciousizing people, how I...
He said, "Shut up like that?
Knowing to separate one's risk.
So I tried to talk to the child and he was making awareness of his parents.
The parents were choosing.
(Laughter) Do I deliver to the children?
People recognize me in the community, and I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege of a school to inform myself, but today I feel like an educator.
Audience: Yes.
I spend the children I know.
(Laughter) In my community, we have one ...
A seed collection when you go outside?
To work with this affection, we have a plantation.
(Laughter) There I met a plant called Hengar's name.
(Laughter) Is it a legominous plant?
What we plant from everything below it is a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
Audience: And all the plants I had.
While below it, we have a good result.
AC: And our community?
When did he go to the arm?
(Laughter) There I met.
That all plants were used, each one in their place.
AC: But I tried to imitate like a building forest, right?
(Laughter) So you have to imitate the forest.
Because there in the arm.
There was a lot of plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Audience: No.
So, I tried to plant them.
(Laughter) variating: I have a hoax, the cup, label, Andiróba, Copaiba.
With Maru, Araná, and everything there, not from the beach.
AC: Before eating, naturally, in the arm, I saw there was a lot of poison, a lot of toxic.
AC: "Mom, blah.
(Laughter) And the fruit from there...
(Laughter) Five partners of ours: in our community, we work everything with organicism.
AC: You eat everything natural.
AC: There's no toxic in our community, OK?
(Laughter)
(Laughter) Do you just see the human being?
Like an animal.
(Laughter) The child compared her and, just paying.
(Laughter) You talk, she's there listening, and then passing me to other children.
(Laughter) I'm paying and I'm paying for this attention.
Then he talks about animal quote.
(Laughter) So I compare the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection.
The most caught by those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all in the desire, "My father says this.
AC: The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person.
What observes my house.
I kept observing my house.
I left my wife.
(Laughter) She always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's just fine.
So ...
(Laughter) I saw all this with my work that was going to do with children?
What is the future?
(Laughter) And it would work out.
And today we have ...
It's a job inside.
I went far from the atom.
I was far from the atom when I started there.
It started in 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom?
It's the turtle of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river that was before.
I had a hooligan.
AC: Let's face.
It's just like that a little bit of our community.
(Laughter) And this hooligan she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the people who repeat it.
AC: Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
So, I went by with people.
AC: Nowadays, when I talk about...
And the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel it?
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) It's typical.
(Laughter) They breathe the pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest?
(Laughter) Is it always talking to people educating children?
"And ...?"
And going on with other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small, that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, I get people and come to approach us.
There, we're talking, are we conscientizing people?
(Laughter) I'm very happy.
(Laughter)
I'm like this, if I don't pass ...
My message, my education for other people, I feel even guilty.
AC: Absolutely, and thank you very much, guys.
What is this?
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
So, to generate these children, they're very proud.
My family is very grateful, these women who helped us achieve this dream, really.
And to create this family: two months ago our son Tancède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasty and leucemia.
It's just ...
(Laughter) It puts life at risk.
Imagine all the blindest ones you are here.
How we don't feel that.
It was like a fear that I lost a challenge.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
Following us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep looking for an optical mood to think.
For him, I was able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and from there, it was very incredible because all the schools and all the friends of us.
They made a whole movement, very big, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people, all the blood, and founded modules.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was ...
And when a child has leukemia and is at risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
And that's what we learned to be this lesson and spread to our friends, to the school's more, to societies, people on Facebook.
I'm not really talking about the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this disease, as public as well, and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's not a family that loves, that embraces each other, that's the same as all these families, because it's not deep.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, or a living father, or a father of a mother, to be a family, or a living father, or a war divorced mother, that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trancheno passed through this disease to the world.
It's that my blood, my blood pressure, was me manufacturing it.
Our favor.
The blood only goes crazy, I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so he raised that consciousness, that we have this ability.
(Laughter) To give blood to what needs.
For someone who has a house, don't go out, blood is necessary in parts.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is processing and need, and delivering oil medication, if each foreign as the donor of wax or the chance of compatibility.
Between a patient's donor, it's about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you win the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I caught myself Ah, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to save in life, if me, more strength, without pain, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that happens to us all.
I thank you all.
Putting ourselves in this union that we aren't feeling this unconditioned support, doesn't know how to save the lives of so big.
In other words, to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
Be like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Pala-La del Chinaud.
"Your Syrian was born in Dama.
Capited from Syria.
In January, I studied at Damasco University.
Today, I'm a refugee in Brazil.
With my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little ...
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
VV: Today.
I'll talk about what bothers me the most: "Brocense that exists about Slam."
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap, and easy to live with the population.
It was 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew about this child, three stores of clothes, obscultory, engineering, two apartments.
I, a car.
Try more.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To meet the world, I went to countries.
AC: Like the United States.
SB: Spider.
AC: It's French.
And until one day?
And the war started on March 15.
It was in 2011.
And there's still.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
(Laughter) In the country, my city in Marco.
I was the safer of Syria, I had between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
Like Tipoi!
I'm five years of war.
My country is this destruction.
What do you see?
Who I know were, thank you.
Carriga, or left.
But their children found their voices.
Swed and mutilated.
I cry, a bomb.
Familiares.
So you'll admire and don't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
"When leaving, hug working?"
My family would come again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have lost everything, they're dead or refugeed in other countries.
And I'm my family.
And we were very sad when we should leave Syria, because we, bars in our lives, left behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
Babrotege my family, I went to Bahirut.
Hi!
Ten months.
Obviously Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad and deserted.
that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil because there were more opportunities.
And the Tevia Pinas or more week Bradelhar Brastrada.
"Firty years ago!"
From my life?
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
Orial is 11 years old.
I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, my children's birthday, and they all said very well.
And I "oprovit."
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
and make food to sell.
And that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper.
In other words, a number ... (Laughter)
And I make food among them.
MB: Even good Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, thank you.
The reception.
of the Brazilian people.
AG: You.
They opened the pôs.
When the world was closed.
CF: Bravo.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
MB: Torre.
"Hi.
OK, guys.
I had a wrong idea.
Over the Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
And then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
The contact with a Muslim person.
A lot!
That I Islam loves blood.
that is allowed to kill the name of religion.
AC: But exactly ...
The opposite.
And I said, "Hi, tac!
What happened in Paris was a crime, not only French nephews, but also white people.
The Syrian, the Islamic State is an terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image.
A religion.
It's the base.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since a person kills, without she killed all men and give her life.
How does life lead to all men to the courtyard in their life, to the berçopolo, 30 years?
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian.
And Brazilians, even with religious culture.
When people see a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that brings hair, just like my wife, they ask questions like, "Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use it?"
AC: This lesson at home, how are you?
Alex Jabi, today, read other roofs.
Men and women can't touch each other, but from each person wanting to buy it, or not, Deblata B prohibits some things to be the same way that they don't obey everything, but I've already seen some humans who do all this, who kiss, it's the square, except of a voice of wedding.
When I left blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner, this isn't happening with me.
Why?
Because these things are made of isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing the guilty, after the Exibian Agency.
People always understand "respect" or "Profeita Mohamadez," that we must respect all religions, that all people have the same value that we must have with everyone.
It doesn't matter, they're white, black.
The Indians, that we should help the people who need, every year we have Alsaacá and we give two dots, five by a moment.
Voz: All of our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Children, today I gave.
And I invite you to learn more.
About Islam.
I'm sure it was something difficult.
Now it's understanding what a religion of people is.
Now, my dream...
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
(English)
Audience: No.
Or, "Thank you."
And so, my children.
And your child?
"Go to the power!"
Creating, together in base.
What is the molecule?
AC: In the small life stories, I've come to recite my tears, I make food, in the naked sun in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the loans of those who always expect to reach, whoever believes to reach, study the girl, what they said to me, but I'm here, I don't understand a service opportunity, a lot of salt, a cooker.
Fascinira.
Why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you take me so much to pay a Secretary course?
But it doesn't even enter the office.
I apologize, as I had a mistake between them, I have several friends who are in this situation and conformed to each other, but I don't want to conquer new areas. Please, I got an opportunity, and the teacher told me, "You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, go into that little room, the vessor is waiting for you, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and this year, it wasn't even completed four months yet.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed, I was on vacation house, due to daily rush, sometimes not time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
And I was shouting there in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And, as I use Facebook, as the diary, I put everything that happens, my mother up to domestic pregnancy for seven years, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid for seven years, and I decided to share the things that everybody wrote, always speaking in the past.
For my surprise, in less than 24 hours, this went viral very fast, and soon after that I put my first story: my first internet story was a reference to my last job as a maid in the city of Santo.
In 2009, I was hired to be a cook, I had to bring the yellows, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
What was the bathroom for houses?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionated this first story on the Internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not of today's stories.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
What I was really surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, that all of them break up and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestic work there are more valued, they earn for hours, so completely different here in our country, for example, an announcement I read.
P: It was for the worker.
And to work secondly.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours, we earned 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, every month, 380 real reais per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
Right when I got home, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, books have cost a lot, and my domestic mother, going through these conditions, today, there are domestic, but, in a single house, I found something I call humanitarian treatment, which is Regina entering the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and knowing the experiences I'd already experienced in the past, and then she started to spread several texts to study, I said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was little, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and it was very difficult."
And to raise awareness in the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the rug of the Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, black woman like me, and exposes some reports.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I've come here to generate adversity."
(Laughter) Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, why?
And the vast majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 79 addicts 6% according to the deese of 2013, are black women.
What about that?
AC: It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be egalitarian for black woman, why do I say it's herdity service, my grandmother?
It was a maid.
My mother was a maid, and I was also a maid.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I couldn't understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
(Laughter) Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with picture and good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least an interview, they had suspense, this after graduation, OK?
I took a suspense to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so on, and then are you?
I said, "Yes, or I'm magical.
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant past, it's coming from us, it's the domestic employees today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I crossed the tape and I got nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door, my boss came."
And then, when I get there, already with the clothes of leaving, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was so strange, ours, I forgot to take your money, Monday, I pay you."
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother was always going to work, and there wasn't much time for her, but all the needs she was going through and suffering was me who was there.
I only wanted to see, she got married, that's it, but unfortunately they didn't invite me to the wedding, but, as I'm aldaged, I put my best clothes, I went to the church, I was hidden and I saw my girl getting married.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
It's Christmas, I'm seeing the family of my players having fun, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
The worst moment in my life is when my boss will work, he'll work, he'll take him...
His wife at work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
To the house.
To hide me.
The only solution I had was to remove copies from all over the world.
So, if I clean the bedroom, I get traffic.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his harassment because when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, do you get 1,800 reais per month?"
I'll gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
I just arrived at a new service.
And I brought my little glass pot.
Because my deaf pot is my little Pininho.
I was there.
And, in this area of service, tired, I got my little soup.
And this number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?
Using the ice cream and the bathroom, what's happening, no, your bathroom can use the bathroom, and there wasn't the employee bathroom that's why I brought little pot.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's money, "Today I'm here."
Statistics.
For some people, in my place, it would be in the cleaning lady, because when I told my lady who I wanted to study ...
Do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
Menine, you have to be happy where you are.
To pay attention.
His grandmother wasn't a maid?
Only the mother wasn't a domestic age, she was already predestined for her family to serve.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, a creative woman.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'm a holiday!
(Applause) Black woman, bubble, teacher, peripherical and root.
Oh, my side!
I'm not talking here, dared.
(Laughter) Yesterday and a half are six million households that should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just the idea of seeing that six million houses are being represented now?
And many of them aren't listening to me, but a power to watch, that they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone here must have several patterns, various patterns, and some domestications, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, various domestications work and study, and here, this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, but it's not to be clear which places some people are in this country.
So, I'm here to control in cities.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million houses.
Which one I thought African and not all the data.
That's it!
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny to go out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Turn off your cell phone.
Don't photograph, because I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
And then I was doing the octave, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
They look at the agenda, see their eye, and it's insecurity, put equipment.
I open inflammation points.
First passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
And this chaos, this situation?
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a present state.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Within this feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment you aren't, inside, the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
You are you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have credit, you have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's a course.
And it was very scary.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that a great friend lived.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced.
AS: Tava.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act, was determining the way I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his cell phone.
I want to say many of you.
Think about it.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I'd really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone and ask because all of you have.
Miauça.
AS: You all have a cell phone.
And turn it off.
Turn off, comes this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off, cell phones?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor.
What about it?
AC: Here, close your computer.
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It stern of connection: who connects with the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back, look at the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
You're fine, you've won a veil.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
And now, with eyes closed.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that's born.
It's fear.
In anybody's man, it's not that guy in front of you, until this guy is now with much more fear that you all gather.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
And a good space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
And in America she had it.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
Is it a strong sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, right now, a different part of your mind is caring.
Do you know where you are and leaving the localization system connected?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were kids, you took your hand to hot chicken chicken and then you learned that a little before your hand, you could play a chicken?
And you'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
Since it's new, since it's new, inclusion, equality, it's new, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
The city tells that much of what we do is determined by what we've already lived.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
These are self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
And all of them.
They are available, they are simple.
But they're the last generation technology.
We already know that in the future of the evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video.
(Laughter) And normally it's now my first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so sedutors that the idea of translated...
I had a demand for a TEDx fan region.
What did you ask to enter society?
It's time shared with your friends, your colleagues, your family.
(Video) In the case of your Brazil.
The translation work is fundamental once it's worth it.
Five percent of people already remember the protestate training.
Five percent, or less, have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
And translating to 16 and 16 in young people.
(English) And with almost 6,000 translations made to everyone.
But we are only translated.
It's also how we transcend.
The talks made in events, like these here.
The work of transcription is important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow people with hearing disabilities to accompany the content of the walls.
When is the talk given in English?
My case here is Helen Portuguese, first, transcribes in the original language.
To then be verified by my time and in English, it's translated to learn more language.
Because, initially?
TEDx, with its own logope, says, "The bond only as TED technology, "Entrortinely," which is the "e" that we can translate as a fun.
We have, for example, and leaving the stage to refer, currently, talks address a infelity of subjects that go from excellent issues about political literacy, businesses, reveredorism, even literature, talks, hunger, and opportunities.
And another of my passions.
Finding what follows the topic is this event with the mind.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
And as well as the reduction of the human work journey throughout people.
I think the shoe that one of the uses I make of my hearing receip is to translate, perform and transcribe as a pride, talks in the TEDx's environment.
The TV shows are short educational eyes that can be the "tertox" stone, can be the TEDx stones, accessible even children in a small child.
And I do this, not only.
Because translating is a passion and the country is also a strict word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex", that is, a "sedex," that is, a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the book that Trantor is a privileged sector, not only because I learn a lot with them, sometimes with me and with the treators.
And not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
inspiring people.
(Laughter) But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) In initiatives like this one.
What do I want?
Second, the philosopher, "Eddy Frome?"
Tell the men's lesson in life.
Audience: Yes.
(Video) It gives light to its sales and turns itself into it.
Because it's potentially that I don't have everything and there was education.
It's fundamental for him.
And I also have no doubt: education is fundamental.
So that people, less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society, can live in a dignified way in our society.
And when it's weight in volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge, expand an object.
"Justly, if I work to return?"
Because I always choose my own decision.
And I have to do the best way possible.
And try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
(Laughter) It's different to donate the pieces.
And we're left on our feet.
Tradition is a complex activity that takes not only to know the same foreign, the sources battle, but mainly.
MA: Our life.
And renovation.
Who throws this one?
For tests from a very violent translation.
(Laughter) There's always.
(Laughter) A warm knowledge has time.
A lot of research.
I said, "Mom, that's it.
And many hours of dedication.
And behind a fluent translation, to be ours, to see?
There's always a great worst distress.
And frustrated by failures?
For the best they can do us, they can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost in definitions.
And here I need to remember -
That most of our volunteers are not professional, this is very important to decide.
Work higher.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations.
(Applause) Not only about the speaker, but without respect to those who don't.
And to guarantee this quality all translations and transitions?
And it goes through a review made by volunteer exchanges.
(Laughter) In order to finally take advantage of a language motto or a language coordinator.
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
And in the case of Brazil, Brazilian Portuguese, who added Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here namely.
I said, "Stories.
We have EPMA, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
I have our guys.
And that's why, in my left, Gustavo.
The tunnel or the Sun.
What is Café?
The world is good.
This obsession I have with education ...
P: Really?
(Video) I was listening.
AC: Not only.
With Brazil.
who lives in a deep, political crisis, where education is released at five of the bread, but without my own personal history.
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Nevertheless, I knew how to write very well and do the four maths tests very well, and his dream was to always study beyond because I had studied and make some kids study.
That's why what was living in our neighbor called Tairobeiras.
And he decided to change his four children the time I paid a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
In some places, my father had sold his start, his logic, Uberas, and his place also established, with the merchant, he found that the material had a presence store, there was a version.
(Laughter) In traffic.
In 1964, there was a great exercise in Brazil.
(Laughter) Forgotten this reession, and other reasons, my father was the false, and he lost absolutely everything, he literally remained, without anything that you kill in his mobile phones.
One felt very humble if I paid, when my father decided after paying his debts.
If you change bedrooms, like a front or behind you, you can eat really enjoyed using it.
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who's now 30 years old, isn't she deaf?
Besides waiting for Paráito Games today.
It was not to know about cooking.
So, for many years, at home, where would you literally win the tattoo, say that passing to the largest parents of pedalization queso?
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it works.
(Laughter) It was done.
The big one, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by Agassa, domicilios.
In the 48 years' franchise, 60 years from Brazil, only 32% of people with greater solidarity than 5 percent.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
(Video) When I was younger days, my father, for example, had interconnected Alávidos.
At the time, when I was seven, we were already alphabetized at seven years old.
And a small cup of impairment, notebook, and asked the area, he chose a buy, and then any visibility arriving at home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Today I keep thinking that this should be the biggest ground sloths of parochia.
But for my father, they would get me there, knocking, without knowing, they had to train a little for this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) This is what my five siblings were able to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children better conditions than those we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my audience's life, it's our two kilos, Daniel, and João Inghan.
Parents I never put this on my chair for me to a newspaper, but for whom I questioned all nights?
And from stories to studies?
(Laughter) So the adventure was always a pleasure for me and four of my children.
Coincident that coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is undoubtedly a being.
At some point in physics.
(Laughter) And one of the brothers is the educator without a mark, for me, fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we have to be homicide by education.
Despite the adverse conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TED?
Just like today, it was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
TEDx inspires us.
And then, fail the idea.
What make us believe.
What's the message?
We can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols, and then they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super conplicated, I started to write the lyrics from this for a while, but when I returned the classes, it was that I forgot my notebook points.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threatened me when I wrote to her that I was learning, I still give her tips.
With that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in Santa Cruz, and we thought that maybe braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where it could feel the time.
We started to research, we started to research, to learn about robotics, programming of our teachers, they only shake and nothing happened, but we reescribed everything, disconnected everything, and it started to work. We did a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and would show the hours and minutes, in Braille, so we could create a report in Braille, it was very emotional.
The whole process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help only in inclusion, and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and if even we, two high school students, who haven't even finished, in high school, we're second, and we're teenagers, we're able to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
You can put your hand.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance commercial relations.
It's a motor trade.
In other words, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the goal of mourning.
So, and another part with a goal.
to enjoy pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
And I know some hundreds.
Men.
And women, who manage their business autonomously, publish their ads.
We received their clients.
In apartments, in hotels.
AC: Or there are street thinking.
And nobody has to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve me 16 or adults that didn't make sense that their consent is crime cases.
These are cases that must be chosen, criminals and judicially.
And I said, "What? What?"
Definitors must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, forever, therefore, a storming prostitution and forgotten frustration.
And it also doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse this situation.
Through sexual exploitation, but to take all the people who do prostitution by victims of traffic action is to confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
Research has shown that it falls in Portugal.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive. They are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I've just said, that here the phenomenon isn't possible, I'm going to give you the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that teaches information about the issues related to human traffic.
And that's relatively the year 2016, the latest available data.
It indicates that 108 traffic victims were confirmed in Portugal.
Human beings.
Almost all of us for job exploitation?
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there's all an email speech.
What are unpleasant from reality?
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
It's very defense.
It's stressed.
And that you're doing something that's waiting for someone.
I wanted the salvation well.
E: But this doesn't respond to reality either, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities.
Therefore, inequalities can only be cultural.
We know there's a diversity of construction.
That influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the internal encounter.
Investigator, interview, I'm with people who work sexually.
What they tell me is that this was an option, an option based after equation in advantages.
And disadvantage that it is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a despair, and it's not recognized.
AC: If I ask you to think what image comes to you right now?
The mind.
It's when you think of a person who prostitutes.
Think about it.
I bet that most of you thought of two situations, or any other one, or a woman.
That's why I'm not scared.
It was and mining that's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, which is very likely a populic parent, and that, of course, there's someone plural.
But this is only two stereotypes.
Because they are simplified images.
What don't you reflect with rigor?
In other words, reality.
There's a huge diversity.
There are people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences.
And these life paths are not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not just cigarette women, there are also many transgender women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I say that the studies that are actually the distance.
And society identifies itself.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
It's called Sindroe.
What will you present?
We are only about 10 to 20% of the total population of prostitution.
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
Oh, they're minor, but they're not neglected.
Let's study it.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by thediac teacher at the University of Lisboa, and interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context, like in the inner context, men, women, transsexual people.
And that, all over the country, there would be 10 victims 2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
They forget it's a percentage of men who are here.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
AS: Although it may appear.
This is an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work.
And this is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
Prohibited, selling sex, but it's crime buying sex.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's even that the people in prostitution are victims.
With no exception, and so, if they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other pensions, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has spoken about the great success of this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there are very strong evidence, namely non- environmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they indicate that this law puts more stream.
That's why sex seedors themselves put rich for sex taste.
And that increases their vulnerability, violence.
And the stigma.
AA: And the disease.
Another idea we have is that everyone.
That this idea of all people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
Mmm ...
It's an idea, without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, people's speeches.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's for an idea that I think ideologically biased.
Even because research has shown that the lessons between workers of their sex and clients.
These are complex relationships and, mainly, we are abusive relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is unpleasant.
who are the people.
Because they are disabled people or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that lead to sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can make them travel to the 21st century professionals.
Even country?
What has the humid figure, who is assistant, sexual, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual donations with people who are disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about the relevance of sexual work and who already destroys any argument that tries to be the favour of the customers' criminalization.
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy.
There are their economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
Control to work connections if this can be done without more explanation than in another job activity, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically sexual moral, which divides sexuality into two types to the side having a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" and consider them legitimate.
It's normal.
That is, anti-natural and that's where the start of the sky was located.
And eating sex is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, social rejection, of decreidibilization, of disvalorization of people who do this activity.
stigma is a mark with iron a profound delivery.
The stigma that rejects sex observators is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
What is at the base of so much discrimination about sexual observers, like, for example.
It's when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone used this word, "No TEDxBas," "The stigma of puta."
It's the worst that I can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and disabled people, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of spada of glasses that's above any of us.
Any woman knows that, if there's a sexual behavior that's disappointed, norms that reads socially, it's horrible.
The duty of being required by a puta stigma.
Because any woman knows how to step at risk.
It can be called puta.
Is it so qualified?
Why do I think we can do anything, can we do it?
(Laughter) So that they don't continue to disrespect sex players.
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
To challenge the stigma, which I'm here to do right now, and to give voice, to listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
It was one of the most attempted attempts of silence over time.
Sex recorders.
So, all over the world, organized and used 70 but, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility, they are not heard.
AC: We haven't told each other, we don't want compassion or tolerance crimes, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to go on.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it was the title.
What is natural that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is here.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Artigo, well cured, art, healed from being a doctor.
It is supported by a fundamental stone in thepassed medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a detachment so that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can provide the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships of our time, with all more superficial and more reasons: I was this balance, it's suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors were also there in various pain.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
That's it.
I never thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear India, India told me this.
Besides jumping, I found myself in a feeling that I wouldn't have since my childhood to relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that love, that care.
He extrapolates.
Audience: Yes.
And this agreement, the request for "didário" and hours.
(Laughter) Or not?
All the doctors who go with us are focused on that.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice.
What?
The simplification that's going can be replicated here too, is the optics that you don't need to go to the middle of the Amazon for all of this.
It was the path I found to discover.
It's a study that dies.
At the beginning of medicine, if you make a list of topics of students' goals, the first goals are there.
Altruism went well.
AS: On these same students.
And in the symbol of medicine, with the same research, the typics, the statement, success.
Changing recognition, healing.
Some when we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant stigma.
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
That's it.
Audience: Yes.
The patient's medical relationship, a medicine, goes back from the past.
(Laughter)
Because it's the weight in medicine, where the father, the medicine, is touch.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't done.
(Video) When I love it, in apples of apple.
Eva unleashed him, that was on a pervious trip, that's what we do until today, hasn't touched the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father in medicine, why for the first time?
He had a method.
You can.
It transformed the art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And in a way that the involvement of these people had a store.
At that time too, it was developed and created a grandma's isolation.
Because, until today, it's used in medicine graduation.
There was a fifth status before Cris.
I brought a photo, OK?
It's not there to eat.
If you're there three words.
Who's in all houses?
She said, "It's just to see the building of the patients."
Listening to all the volunteer and corruption damage, especially the seduction of women, men, children and surroundings.
That's it.
And you saw the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
And if I respect this jury, I didn't hear it there.
It would be aigno of equality of reputation between men in all times, there is a violent transversor that happens to me contrary.
Why, at that time, worry about this, and still today you do a training?
Because the more patient's relationship is essential for a good cure, so it's.
Today, few things are taken by July of honor, and, in this case, I've seen a honor of taking part in a profession which is taken for a judgment of honor.
Medical knowledge in Greece is an individual.
To produce science in a way that our fellow man could go further.
Why did the medical knowledge proliferate in such a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit of this, we'll specialize a lot in healing this, and we'll lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't, no.
Once I was in a classroom in college, in the classroom of small groups, as a teacher.
And I played with Spanish processes, patients who have aography, resonance, in two jokes, which copied our ultrason.
If I look for their belly, I didn't take their awareness at home.
(Laughter) "Ah, I took the composure, the guy called me a little, called my class and said, "Let's see the barrier."
But isn't it?
I had to cover the patient's finger, which demoked that he was smoking in front of me and didn't smoke anymore, but it showed that he had emagreirable.
Men on Earth?
It's luxury and pain you can see if it's building care.
Right to the dirty belly, you can say a lot: "The time you're mexing at the patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he has, if he can remember something he didn't tell you in the office, and said, "If all this doesn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable classroom, it's testing you to extend me.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally for him, to be careful with him, that you're wearing black people, that you want to do good there, that you're asking good, they're for him, let's take care of you.
This is this magic.
It's not only beautiful for your child, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap and are appeared, they improve faster and have a bigger label.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no horizontal changes, no ralutism, you don't see anything, diseases have symptoms.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already woke up to do the same time.
It's very interesting to talk about the average relationship of the patient, but to be a patient, I'm patient and to be passive to those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
Because, after all, relationship actors are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two aires.
And there are doctors, they donate.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, that was in our cure process, in the decisions of the cure process.
To do this.
The first point, the most important, is information.
The difference is that, at that time, to get to know someone, publish something, which is a publisher, to have content to talk, today, a Google, you have a very good and important information, but, many, very importantly, we need to know, filter the capacity to generate information, it was greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think about is, once in information, first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they allow me not to do this bad, what this lets me is the same to other people who are defending personal interests, either profit or medicine, or other things.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: don't believe in good things, make frozen things, look, medicine changed, now your problems ended, seriously beer, the information run, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing that you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my most when I don't know, delicily and immediate, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time, fool.
Think, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
If it's a gap, add the information.
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me is that they don't present, and finally.
Take the information, discuss it to your doctor, it was for that.
Inform is information, knowledge, training, taking part in your cure.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
If you have a right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years."
I know there's some time, but I don't think that's going to change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of...
To exist is not to get there fighting with everyone, not body teachers, not that.
(Laughter) Strangely, you know?
And there is: if we compost with time, we go.
And to make atendments different.
Do you want doctors?
They want to be worth it.
They don't want to have this attempt, like the name now, they want to serve the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, in the human area.
What we had of a patient there, that had skin cancer.
It's that with humor.
NJ: In our finger.
And there was no speechologist for us, we brought it to São Paulo, which is being treated here at the Cancro Institute.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his translator, he was one of them, he didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, had a translator, he was the son of the destiny who spoke very little Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was obviously woke up, and I presented a consultation that would give me a scene.
The Indius, the orometric, you like this.
Isn't it?
Oops.
The doctor went.
Very well.
(Audience) Yes.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had all this interest in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art of well-being, so it doesn't need to talk a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors taking care of teachers who are anonymous, few, in ambulants, and in office.
What am I doing?
Isn't it?
Culting a good fight.
What is it?
We're attending it.
That's it.
MA: We, elderly.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment, more compassion, and all patients.
Try to be active in your cure process, which is not to do, because it gives a connection, and the world more and better, and you'll be more invented, something different.
Men.
Please.
I wanted to start with the world here: 35,000.
What happens to have this money?
This number is the quantity of decisions that human beings make daily.
And it makes more or less a decision every two seconds.
And the person?
Two: you noticed making a decision for whom your attention and the talk is interpreted.
AC: He talked about decisions I'd like to tell you about, with a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my grandmother to make decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this rigoring magazine.
The founder from the magazine had three emotions in this nature.
AC: A digital nature with 59 dollars.
A printed magazine structure, the Servinho Ciculares, which is a wine and more pressing digital nature, and also a winner.
The reasoning of this first is that the majority of people chose as CFR52.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups.
For the second group, it was only the exhibition of the two options.
GB: A digital option, 58 players.
And evolution of how José do Victores too.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I tell myself about these experiments, I wanted to think that this notion of the middle of series and 25 dollars is a printed notion.
What did nobody choose?
What did this option change, most people chose the new one?
And that left me very uncomfortable.
What I wanted to overcome most is that I would make that decision.
I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this person came to the name.
She replied.
It's a position that's placed in an equation to influence Dr. They make a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economy and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive School and neuroscience applied the decision-making.
I wanted to give a formula like this, interesting, you must study.
AK: I had two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the three option.
You really like to see something past.
AC: This observed through your finger, does your name to be better, for those I'll always pay and we've studied ourselves today.
AC: Our company, if I can have two at the same time.
This is an impression, because I started to ask myself why it's all about it.
And a talk that even from TED made me understand everything.
Her name is to make a comparison.
These behaviors were they before today.
I think everyone looks like a daily area role.
The cycle of their users seems a little bigger than the blue symbol in the right.
Please?
Because what's around us makes us look differently.
TB: You have to go to the center of my state.
But we see it differently, because I've got around the Inclusive.
And there's another biological illusion that I was fascinated by coming, which is this one.
The pieces of needing chess up.
They are equal to chess and lower pieces.
(Video) Narrator: It's the same time that will do your problem before arriving at all this.
But I'll show you that it's the same.
Without staying in the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
When I saw this presentation, it's the best time I understood it makes some sense to say that it's around us, it's the way what's around us, we have to fill the door, we see things.
What's around the reserve is the means of all the decisions.
Travel doesn't have technology.
And there wasn't only where to avoid working in a project to create an application through insurance.
He said, "If we want to be happy."
It's a lot of option and life won't be explored.
You can choose this illusion of dreams, of three, or this is two.
And he won't be old, insecure.
What we were working, but they said that 500 km of possibilities of choice.
The team I was working ended up supposing a way to simplify this choice to people, this way it was made in another profession, if the person was all an hour, she had these three options.
If the person boosts in half chronic media, he sees these three donations.
It was then fighting for them to be the concept of the Forbes magazine.
I have just realized that there are people.
What makes the drawing of architecture of decisions, today I'm walking in decisions.
This caught me a lot of versions in the world of technology, which is even the name for this profession, called YOEX, but exactly the people who are the architects of decisions and habits or the usefulness of the user, work to pass the architecture of the decision, designing all forms and environments in all decisions.
As incredible as it may seem, mine, if today he found a day with this father, his face is him, he's the person who's a burden in this subject of behavioral economy, and he said, "Look, I found here at UFRJ, and there's a role with Denário Helen."
which really changed my renovation of seeing and behavior.
She think we don't need research to know that we use a lot of cell phones, that everyone warned him to be in their cell phone, their pocket, or outside their pocket, look at him, but she came to a research in the company that he had a competition.
AC: If you must have some of you who have a smartphone, it's a thing outside for 22 hours.
Try with my ancestors and Helen Moore.
So, in those 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think they are digital decisions?
(Video) Narratories established these rhythm and metal regions, which enabled the stories to be in their world.
I started to ask myself about this.
When the panic a person dies, does this decision come to me?
Will everybody change the success of the path we will take, "Will the money there have in this region or not be the success that I didn't know is bad?"
AC: And how are these decisions from him, shouting power?
For me to need it, I took the "nos," it's the web, it's Google.
It needs identity.
Talking about Dougramas, I came to talk to you about another interesting way.
It's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata it's Equada with C.
You'll have to start thinking what this was and say, "Where will the magazines be?"
I don't know.
(Laughter) It seems it's not strange.
(Laughter) In this radio, it's a number of two young people.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Austria have 99% of young donors, what in Austria do you already have an album donor?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a little word called "défol" magic.
This word is what you're already.
I don't know how to do anything.
These are the decisions I call the "capitão de nascimento," "You need to get out."
Someone has already took this picture for you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my cell phone these days, and there are two options: one survived the reels.
And another question was to receive.
Hello.
The Greeks were dismantled, the offers were killing.
So someone decided I wanted the party and I didn't want to receive it, so I went there and went out.
What to get out says the entrance mark and Marcelo do Recife.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
And I opened Uber, I was there in a tune to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave, if I was really in the people, and even ...
I thought it was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver, I don't know if you get the work they love to talk about.
And then, a truck from Uber once tells me a story.
Here is a lady.
Choosing a shortcut.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "Look at this, there's another façades, man?
He looked at her and said, "If he chose the cube."
She said, "I can't read it, right?"
So Barcelona was going to choose him without even knowing.
She chose what was already chosen by her.
Are you seeing?
This is very complicated, it's very interesting for us to imagine who are these decisions.
AC: If we go to Google today, we need to eat as a person today, it has 567 thousand results.
What do we click?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from people was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the web page.
I love the page seven, and I see from there what has the page: "I'm on the website."
Just to ask her.
AA: In fact, that's Google, Uber, giving us little apples.
AC: These guys, in English, have a name in the behavior economy, they also have a name, they are called "innants."
It wasn't exactly a little push in English, I'd like to ask you to study a little push to the person next to you, yes, we don't understand what to do inside.
What am I doing, beauty?
So, that's the snacks: Is there a theory?
AR: From an author called "Britateler," he has a book called Nães.
And the concept of ditonand is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these impacts in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "I thought, I want to walk.
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a photo of my important view.
AC: You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Detina Mar.
AC: Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation e-mail.
(Laughter) In the middle of a text.
And written: "When you apply in a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you'll make in your life."
(Laughter) Luis Pica, me.
The fact that you don't want to give up is easy to stay in that link and ask to leave.
And how many people criticized the book?
AC: More than 400 inscribed people.
CF: Three people stayed together.
So, this means that I get all the decisions of the life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, that was only an experiment according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I motorize the results.
People usually ask me, "Teacher?
Why have this knowledge of these discomforts?
Of those grades.
And this can do because we manipulate someone?
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
Like, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it to make someone buy something they don't need, or you can use it for good, know the moment, serve for more insulin.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this bonet, the same autochem, which makes the meal of cereal waves to detect a thread to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
AC: There's an event that happened in 2016, that made people around the world leave 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
Who is trying to understand better?
AC: How do these little cards work, how do these "nights" work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more conscious.
To make better decisions, thank you.
