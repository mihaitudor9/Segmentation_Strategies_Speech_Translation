Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference?
Or if it should have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, people with no disabilities, today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work, and one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress? Is there any difficulty in putting clothes, does it need someone's help, or does it interest fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study, then I talked to various women, including toplets that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that would meet their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two bigger numbers, they would take the sewing to make some foreigns, and that made them lose money, and many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work, in these conversations, this was the conclusion that I arrived, that this lockery was really necessary and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
And I made her a pack with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort, which made a discreet zip to give her the exchange of the son that is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to disappoint with others without disabilities, in fact, for people who are quadriplegic, the ideal, is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who will dress the person, and paraplegic that gives autonomy, so that people can dress themselves alone.
And, on the other hand, in this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with disabilities, well ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position, to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, in fact, the ideal, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, down to top, reversible, and I wrote her name in braille so she could identify that the play would be the one used on the day of the desfile, in fact, so people could have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's wing has the same, and for women, with abyss or low status, the ideal.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and corderous princess, we think of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes in the child's childhood sessions.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, that means more than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data in 2010.
(Applause)
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses and more technological products.
You know it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I participated in the third, and I took a party dress to Juliana, and I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Adrica.
And many other people, many other stylists, went outside, who were already launching inclusive collections due to the size of success which was the first, that big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who realized the real need of this dreshold, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We must all think about this, have empathy, look at others, who are changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal with our differences, thank you very much.
What is this?
(Laughter) In contrast with a name, I have two wonderful children who were created thanks to two women who helped us there in California to make this dream, to create this family, to generate these children, they are very proud, also the family and very degrees, to a leukemia.
This leads the life of the enriching.
Imagine all the children and parents who are here, how we feel them.
Like a fear that has lost our child.
And we had two options: we could confuse, cry, or solve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and keep looking for an optical melody to find.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, donating medication, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message was ...
That when a child from Teleucemia and tennis of life, all the rest of fears, worry don't matter, everything that doesn't have any relevance, really matters, and this doesn't matter anymore, or most important is life, the fight for life, and love.
The second message he passed through this public disease and all this movement found a donor.
It was that people saw us as a family, or two women, or a mother divorced warrior, or important, I love the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trancheno passed through this disease to the world.
(Laughter) So, if you - I thank all of you that my blood, my idle, the chance of compatibility, between a donor and a patient, I, when Mecadastre... Oh, it was a very beautiful moment to hope that they call me so that I can save in life, my broken blood, or so concrete, I'm a human being able to donate to other human beings.
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
The base is like you.
This is nostalgia, two slams.
My name is Talola El Chinawi, I'm Syrian, born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
And an engineer I studied at Damasco University, today, I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little French in Portuguese.
That's why.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Broancetto," that exists about Slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
Before the war, friends were 23 million people and I had my family, Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap, and easy to live, two apartments.
I, a car in Damasco, and I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15th, 2011 in drama, then.
It came to all the other cities of the country, my city of the mask was the safer of Syria, between 20 and 25 bombs.
Good morning, then.
My last years of war, or my country is destroyed, family, disappeared, and they didn't go back to Syria, they were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian are dead or refugeed in other countries, when we have to leave Syria, they still live there, and I don't know if I'll be able to return, as a day, to my country, I still don't know if I'll live them again.
To protect my family, I went to Bahirut, after ten months, I had opened doors to Syrian, so I went to talk in Brazilian Baixada and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil because there were more opportunities.
And I had only one week to leave behind 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two 11-year-old children, and it was with a lot: today, I have a Brazilian daughter, Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, and everybody talked very well about the food that my good challenges talked about to take advantage of which is a very good kitchen.
And making food to sell was there that I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has pen and paper, but the number is the same community.
And I make food in betweengo.
(English) Even good WhatsApp.
We're happy in Brazil, thank you.
The reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, Branus, Etrest, who, due to war and terrorist attacks.
Many people had a wrong idea.
After that happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk, or talk, or contact with a Muslim person, today in the morning, or a journalist says to me, "I think I like blood."
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the French windmill, but also Branus, who is suggesting Islam's image, or a basic religion, opposite, not only skeptical book since a person kills, without having killed another, all men seek, about their life, bescola, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims, Muslims, lonely, like me, my life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between blind and Brazilians, even with the differences of culture and religion.
When people see a woman using Ri Jabi, Deblata Bruib, some things, you have to use this silence with this heat, you use this lesson at home too, but I've already seen some humans who do all this, who kiss, hugg, and kiss only, have other rules, like my wife, who don't obey everything, but I've already seen.
When I left blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner, this isn't happening with me.
(Laughter) Why are these things made of isolation?
Despite not knowing Moislam, after the Exibican Agency understands all of our money for the people who need, every year we have Alsaacá, and we give two dots five percent, but despite not knowing Moislam, after we exhibit ourselves as poorer.
It doesn't matter if the poor are Christian, today.
(Video) And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it was a basic privilege.
And now, my dream ...
This is the best Islam, my son here in Brazil, that the world knew his children to end prejudice.
Valbuder to grow together based on the cell item.
(Video) In the short stories of life, I come to recite my tears, in the sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the loans that always expect to reach, whoever believes to reach, don't believe, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity of service, there was a mountain, a cook.
By the lady, why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, he gave me an opportunity, and the waiter told me, "You follow this corridor, you'll right up, turn on the left, enter that little side, that the vessor is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
From that moment on, when I shared this first story on the internet, I was hired to be a cook, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life, so I got there one day, in the middle of my life, because I thought I would receive only stories of the past, other people have gone through this, and not today's stories, in 2016.
And soon when I got home, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but books, until today, it was very expensive, and my mother, domestic, going through these conditions, still, at 18 hours, earning 38,000 Brazilian reals, and I started to tell these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil, when I started to talk about the situation of domestic companies here in Brazil, and then I interviewed Regina entered the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, I started to cry, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts to study, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then she sat there with me and said, "What I'm doing, I started to remove little, and I saw there was a book and exaggerate."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery was still not over.
Because there are women working in analog situations of slavery, today I came here to generate adversity, because I believe that only through the discomfort we can change some things, and it was known as the media of the time as terror of the patroas, all of this when I eat and spon some reports, and people are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil, and 79% are of domestic, my grandmother was a maid.
When I arrived to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, and I started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me, at least an interview, take a suspense, after graduation, I had a suspense of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on, and then is you, yes, or am I magical?
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter)
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house was in the past are luxury apartments today, which were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past isn't having a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the housing employees today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to get there on Friday, and when I got there, I was already there with her clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was the maid's money."
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding, but, as I'm a happy thing.
And sadness knocked me because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because modern Madonna, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back home.
To woke up, and the only solution I had was to take pictures from all over the world.
So, if I clean the bedroom, I get traffic.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can run away from his fridges, because when I say that I'll change employment, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you gain 1,800 per month, you'll never get this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala.
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service, brought my little power to solve.
Because my deaf pot is my Pinico.
I was there, in this line of service area, tight, I picked my saving poin and made it in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the gate of ice and the toilets, what's happening, your bathroom can use the toilet, and there wasn't the maid toilet for that I brought soap?"
Because modern coast is the maid's money: today I'm here contrary to statistics.
For some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are."
To pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but her mother wasn't a domestic, she was already predestined for her family to serve.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
Right.
(Applause)
(Applause) Would I be holiday?
(Applause) On my side, black woman, fat, peripherical and rack teacher.
I'm not alone here, dared.
(Applause) Yesterday and a half are 6 million households that should only be by my side.
So I'm here telling the money we don't have money, but only to see that six million households are being represented now, and that in other countries various domestics, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, because in other countries, why babies have to be seen as white.
(Applause) They are from African cows and not all united.
Invisible can travel the wind.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny about exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect: turn off your cell phones.
And don't photograph, because I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
And then I was doing the octave, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop, he turned to me and said, "It's funny."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20, from the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize.
It started.
Seeing your eye, opening the agenda, and insecurity, puts equipment.
The bridges inflammation points, the first step from the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered a quote from an author, he said, "This is the door of the entrance to a state of presence."
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
From this feeling, from this moment of presence, which is the moment you're not inside, the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're your human potential.
When I put my foot inside, guys, if you are a human being, you don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex, what I found.
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
AC: I found several emotions, various emotions.
What I didn't know was that I lived a big fear.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced, the way I used to act, was determining the way I perceived life, was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Audience: Yes.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just stood the man.
I want to say many of you.
They thought, "I don't need it."
Others justified their importance, so now I'd really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone and ask because all of you have.
Listen to me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
Turn off, comes this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor?
That's it.
(Laughter) So, back there, close your computer.
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you the external tool of connection, who connects with the human being.
Now, look at the later walls, look at me, look at the ceiling, to the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
You're good, you got even a little kiss.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born of fear.
In any man, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's a real fear of what's inside, a fear of this emotional map of life.
With closed eyes?
and give me space.
Remember where you are.
Remember the ceiling, remember the walls, remember the dimensions coming to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system of the human brain: we're connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, right now, a different part of your mind is caring.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
(Laughter) Feel the chair where you are.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to hot chicken, and soon you learned that a little before your hand touched Chica, you felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chica, to feel that there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the system of vocalization linked and feeling where you are.
Observes.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult, it's new, it's new, it's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
(Laughter) It's you who you are.
Look inside and explore silence is realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become on the planet along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them, so available, are simple.
But they're the last generation technology.
We already know that in the future of evolution of race, direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
What you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity to another autensity: silence is a source of freedom.
The TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video.
(Laughter) And normally it's my first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated, part of a demand of a TED formula region that asked for translations, sharing fashion, their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In Brazil's case, translation work is fundamental, only once.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world, 10% of them are Brazilians.
translating to 166 languages and almost 6,000 translations made up until now.
But we not only translate, but we also transcribe the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow people with hearing disabilities to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, as it's my case that creates Portuguese, first it's transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified for my time and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
Initially, TEDx with its own prototype says, "The bond only with technology than it brings, "entertainely," which is the "e" that we can translate as entertainment, and, design, to the stage, to refer, today, to the talks, approach an infelity of subjects that go from excellence.
And another of my passions.
And leaving what follows the issue is this accident with the goal.
It's that it has a resume that we have later not only, from our greatest expectation of life, but also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think the shoe that one of the uses I make in my hearing reception is to translate, make and transcribe as an eye talk in an environment for "date," which can be the "sterox," TEDx talks, or the CNNEME's, are short educational sounds, accessible to very small children.
And I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a strict word in my life.
It's not only that helps me deal with my thirsty, or just a anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the book that Trantor is a privileged sector, not only because a pleasure to translate these talks into sedexes, to be toxic, joy, not only because they'll predict me and lead condutors.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
inspiring people, but why do I think my time is precious?
(Laughter) Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent in initiatives like this: stupid.
The second is the philosopher, "Edm From?
Tell the main lesson of man in life.
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) It gives light to itself and become what is essentially, that I have no doubts about education.
And it's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt: education is fundamental.
So that people with less privileged, with good crimes, the excluded to our society can become part of a dignity in our society.
And, when I think of volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge, and heal an object just because it's a volunteer work, because if a choice is my decision.
And I have to do the best way possible and try to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces, the remains of our time.
Tradition is a complex activity that awakes not only to know the same foreign, the sources of struggle, but mainly our class.
João Andrexia.
Behind a well-defined translation, there's always a wide knowledge that changes research, a lot of work, a lot of hours of dedication.
And behind a fluent translation, to be kiss, there's always a great worst distress.
(Applause) What frustrated with failures?
(Laughter) For the best they do us, they can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost in definitions.
(Laughter) And here I need to remember that the vast majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the vast majority.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations, not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who will watch.
And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transcessions go through a review made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally be taken by a black color motto or a barge coordinator, or as we call "Portuguese," which is quite different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here namely.
I said, "Stories.
We have IPM, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
We have our boys, who are for fire, my grandson, Gustavo, tunnel, and Rafael.
The world is good.
This obsession that I have with education has to do with it.
Not only with Brazil, who lives a deep, political crisis, where education is released at five of the bread, but without the same my personal history.
My father, who today would have about two years, if he had seen, didn't take the primary school course, despite that, I knew how to write very well and do the four characteristics in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond because I had studied and do with his four children at the time to some places, the biggest city we sleep.
In some places, my father had sold his start, his logic, Uberas, and his place also established, with the merchant, he, from a small hotel, had a presence store that had in the rest.
(Video) However, in 1964, there was a great reession in Brazil, due to this reession, and other reasons, with my father was the false and absolutely lost everything, he stayed, literally, without anything, that you kill in the seconds with serious mobile phones.
One felt very humble if I paid with my father's name, he decided after paying his teeth, if he moved to Belo Horizons as ahead or behind, to eat very enjoyed from zenco.
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who's now 30 years old, isn't she deaf?
(Laughter) Besides waiting for Paráito Games today, there.
It was an excellent cook, drinking from the practice sales, my hand, and she decided to squeeze for many years in my house, wherever she wanted, was literally, cancer, tell her about ticket in the biggest pedestrial parents.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it was done.
The greatest done without a doubt, because according to data from the penetration of national research for Mossitos Tomicílios, in the quarrel of 48 years, at 60 years of Brazil, only 32% of the people in greater solidarity than the fundamental yes.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
In the slightest days, my father, for example, had the habit of standing up when I was seven years old, at that time, we were a literacy at seven years old, who provoked me the way up, when the book asked my newspaper, full of gold to him, and to any visit that was coming home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
(Laughter) Anyway, today I keep thinking that this should be the greatest panic seen in parochia, but for whom I questioned all nights, stories before all, that adventure has always been a pleasure for me and four children, Daniele, that João Nik, the parents I've never put this talk here.
Education is being an accident at some point in life, and one of my brothers is an educator without absolutely fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies in students' education.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, in obsession, we had to be homicized by education, in spite of the adversal conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was so simple, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
(Laughter) TED doesn't inspire you to spread the idea.
What make us believe.
Despite everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from dots on my notebook and letters of music, film names, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet and many times, and we thought that maybe the armile could give an interesting project, but when the classrooms came back, I started to write a clock, we, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the schedules.
We started researching, we started to research, to learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and they only shake in nothing, but it reescribed everything, disconnected everything, and reconnected everything, and it started to work, but, as we saw there was no Internet, we created something to help others from what they are for us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project.
The whole process we went through, got to know a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world, suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest, it can help not help with our actors and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create. With this, we are committed to keep studying and researching to create an even bigger impact.
So, we wanted to show a video that our aunt, besides the time in the clock, the senses, the sounds, and leave the message that many things seem very simple, didn't have been created, and, if we, two students from high school, who hadn't even finished, in high school, we are teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help the body.
Thank you very much.
Let's ask a question.
What do you think?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
You can put your hand in the air.
OK, we're all agree, two or more adults, free and consent, can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use, the only difference or the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercials is that there's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the objective to have profit and another part with the objective of having pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know a few hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their advertisements.
They receive their clients, apartments, hotels, or street thinkers, and they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults that didn't make sense than their consent is crime cases, are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is overwhelmed, I also think there's a terminal case, and, forever, there's always a stilherent type of traffic for sexual action.
The tendency to confuse that, in this case, against sexual exploitation, is to confuse a small part as if it were all.
Research has shown that Portugal the traffic phenomenon falls towards sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that can't be identified, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, that here the phenomenon isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that teaches information about human traffic issues.
It indicates that in Portugal 108 human traffic victims were confirmed, almost all of them for job exploitation.
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, I was listening to a single victim to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't mean is there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution, many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
It's very defense.
There are storms that are waiting for someone to wrap well.
E: But this doesn't respond to reality either, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider that they are victims and they consider they had an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate to economic inequality.
We have socio-ecultural inequalities, we know that there is a diversity of building that influences the decision-making.
(Laughter) But when we talk, when we interview, when I meet researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with the people who do sex work, what they say is that this was an option, a punished option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a despair, and it's not recognized.
If I ask you to think what is the image that comes immediately to your mind when you think of a person that prostituates?
Think about it.
Okay, and I can the majority of you have thought of two situations, or of any prejudice, or, therefore, a woman of evil aspecto and minissaia in a corner, in a dark street of the city, which is very likely a legislation and who, of course, has some plurality, but this is just two stereotypes, these are simplified images that don't reflect with rigority.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life, not just women on the streets.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not just cigarette women, there are also many transgenre women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are constant and defeated, the Western cities.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century, indicate that the street presentation.
What would it represent us about 10 to 20% of the total of prostitute people?
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
They're less, they're minor, but they're not neglected, we'll give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by thediac teacher at the University of Lisboa, and interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of the street, as in the context of the inside, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10,2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8 percent of trans women and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even more high.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to tell you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
AC: Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanist, when it is analyzed deeply, it realizes that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not prohibited to sell sex, but it's a crime to buy sex, the idea that's based on this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception, and, therefore, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
And that indicate that this law puts higher risk the tastes of sex, put rich people for sex taste, and that increases the debility of violence, stigma and disease.
Another idea we have is that all people who are in sexual work are victims.
This is a fantastic idea that without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's for an idea that I think ideologically biased.
Even because research has shown that the lessons between sex workers and clients are complex relationships and that, mainly, are not abusive relationships, but there's a kind of client that thinks that perfectly shows this law the idea of eliminating the customers is unfortunate.
who are the disabled persons or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who recruit sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can make them travel to the 21st century professionals.
There are even countries.
who have the humid figure, who is assistant, sexual, who is someone who's trained to know how to have sexual relations with people who are disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about the relevance of sexual work and who already destroys any argument, so if people.
You can do this as an option.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence, there can be a sexuality and considered legitimate, normal and natural, that divides sexuality into two types, if it can be controlled about work connections, if this can be done without more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And the fact that eating sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is based on the devalorization of people who do this activity, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers, like, for example, when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security, and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, "No TEDxBas," "The stigma of puta."
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The biggest offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and disabled people, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And, in this sense, puta stigma is an instrument that is above any of us, any woman knows that, if there is a sexual behavior that is discarded, the norms that are socially described, the risk of requering puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called a puta.
So, what do I think we can do any of us so that they don't keep on disrespecting sex-respectors?
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge the stigma that I'm here to do right now, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempted attempts of silencing over time: the callers of sex.
So, everybody, organized to use 70 but, precisely because of stigma, their voice has no credibility, they're not heard, they're not taught, we don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we should keep disrespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is bad.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Art, well cure art, cure the doctor, is supported by a fundamental stone, in the patient's medical relationship.
But at the same time, I have to have a total distancing that allows me to empathize this relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to get involved spiritually, this is a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have the compassion, a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so I can provide the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships with our time, in the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times, as a surgery, in these trips that I've followed many doctors who were also there in many places.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white avoidance, I thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
This response there, I found a feeling that I nourished from my childhood to relate to someone who needed what I knew to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement that love, the ones that this required, the request of indame, schedule or schedule.
All the doctors who go with us are focused on that.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo what we bring to another field practice, what?
The simplification that's going can be replicated here too, is the copy that she needs to go to the middle of the Amazon, which is all this, it was the path I found to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university, if you make a list of topics of students' goals, the first objectives are: altruism, where's good?
Of these same students, with the same research, at the symbol of the medical course, healing, the bodies of successful statement, recognition, and we handed a technical, poetic, who knows a lot about medicine, but he knows nothing about us.
That's it.
The relationship with a Belgian relationship with the patient, with medicine, goes back from the past, in Greece.
What is the neck in medicine, where the father, medicine, which is pop, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before, when Dan, in Gasboa, Maçã, Eva drew holes, and that was on a trip around us, and that's what we do until today, hasn't touched the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father in medicine, because for the first time he had a method?
Perhaps, it transformed the art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated, and to involve these people with a logic of poop.
That until today is used in medicine in the world, a fifth century before Christ, people on a door.
These are slightly complex words, you prepare three words.
In all houses, they entered.
It was then worth to see the editor of the patients, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduation of women, men, children and ceremies.
That's why you've heard respectfully the life of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
So, today, few things are taken by judgment of one, in this case, I'm honest to participate in a profession that is taken by a judgment of things we thrive because it has to, in transgression, because the most patient's relationship is essential for a good cure.
The medical knowledge in Greece, an individual, covered this, and each group is taking care of a little bit, with that, we'll specialize a lot, and we'll lose what happened with it, the medical knowledge that projected in a way that our neighbor could go further, which the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge, so today, a patient has a last doctor.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in a classroom at college, in the classroom of small groups, with teachers, I have aography, resonance, endoscopy, when it copied us, the illustration... "Oh, I also compost, let's see the whole barrier, and we'll see the whole belly."
It's painful.
I had to cover the patient's green, that squeezed what was forming and didn't smoke anymore, the waste of five times showed that he had emagreciation.
Mone in the skin, lud and dose, you can see if he's managing to take care of his own clothes, the dirty cage can say a lot, "Ah, when you're using the patient, you have a moment of intimacy, he can go to the trap with something that didn't tell you in the doctor, and says, "If all this doesn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
And you're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to extend me.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally for him, to be careful with him, that you're wearing black people, that you want to do good there, that you're asking good, they're for him, let's take care of you.
This relationship is this magic, it's not only beautiful in philosophy, but it's replicated in science, it increases the number of functional diseases, our middle, the same employees, and the house doesn't know because it appears, there's no surgery, there's no change, no Ralti, you don't see anything, it's diseases that are symptoms.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and said, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the average relationship of the patient, but to be a drug dealer relationship, I'm patient and be passive to those who are talking to me."
Because we'll talk about this to a group of mistakes because, after all, the active act of the relationship aren't the doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two aires.
There are doctors against patients, and it's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and it's in our cure process, in the decisions of the cure process.
To do this.
There are content to say: today, with Google, you have a infinity of very good and important information, so you know someone, publish something, which is a editor, what you had to filter the ability to generate information, it was greater than the capacity to filter, so there are some things that we have to give up first, information, today, usually sign.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they believe for nothing, that's not bad, because this leads me equally to other people who are defending personal interests, money or selling media or other things like this.
Now, your problems have ended, seriously, on the third, hardly there's something very important: don't believe in good things that you know this, information runs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my mostly when you don't know: wandering, no one shares information, etc.
Take the information, discuss your doctor, and it's there for this: information isn't the same as knowledge, but apologize your doctor.
Secondly important thing to be a national article in the cure process is to ask, to exist, to know, position time, we're going to make atendments different, don't want to exist, it's not to get there fighting with everyone, not teacher, it's not this, it's wisely to know, there's a right to know for medicine, there's a right to know which risk on the scale.
Once I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, I appeared mountains, in the herom area, that we had a patient there, who had skin cancer.
It's that with humor.
So, for us, we brought it to São Paulo, it's been treated here at the Cast Institute in Uber.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his trip, it was a enterprise that obviously didn't speak German, there was a translator, it was the son of the destiny who spoke very little about Portuguese, how it was very bad, he was obviously upset, and I made a consultation that, for me, would give a scene of a film.
The polometric index, you like this.
"Oh, OK, OK?
The doctor was, "Dad, it doesn't matter."
What I'm trying to say with this is that, at that moment, the magic happened that individual without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, that other individual, had all interest in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art of a short man, so you don't need to talk a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors working in few products, in ambulants, in office, and who are anonymous.
We, doctors, can try to find, doing, healing, answering, then, what this is not to do, because there is a connection and all patients, more compassionate, and the world will be invented.
Good evening.
(Laughter) He talked about decisions I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions that changed my way of making decisions: the participants of the magazine had three emotions of nature: a digital structure with 59 dollars.
The reasoning of this experiment is that the majority of people chose as a digitally printed to also be winners, that an astronomer gains as a digital, but also prizes to be winners.
What I really like these experiments is that, usually, they have two groups for a second group, only two options were divided.
GB: A digital option, 50 players.
GG: And evolution of the process of institutors as well.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I tell myself about experiments, I wanted to think that this option in the middle of 165 Brazilian reals regarding press, that nobody chose what this option changed most people's eye.
This left me very uncomfortable, it's called Tikorio, I studied the crisis a lot, I studied the environment's situation and even the name, it's an option that is placed in an equation for the theory that studies cognitive tip and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
AC: There's a formula like this, it's interesting, you want there, but in two options of the idea, you make an option to be better, for what I'll pay between 22: in our company, if I can have two for the same.
And this is impressive because I started questioning myself about it all, and a TED talk that even made me understand everything, was in a talk that he made a comparison.
These behaviors with them before today.
I think everyone appears with Gélio Ambióia. The cycle of users seems a little bigger than I follow in blue in the right year, do you agree?
Because I have another better illusion than I was fascinated by coming, but we see it in a different way, because I have around influencers, the truth is the choice of my size, which is this one here.
The pieces of needing chess up are equal to chess pieces and low ones.
That's when I looked and said, "No, I have the Man's problem that I'm already all this, but I'll show you that it's true."
Without staying at the store, we only see that they're really good.
When I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes some sense to say that what's around us will also be the same as the night of making decisions, the same way as what's around us, to influence the way we see things, the work in technology.
And there wasn't only where to avoid working on a project to create a connection through insurance, and we were picking one of the difficult figures, it's a lot of option, and we started to explore.
You can choose these two options, these three, or these two, and the team I was working on, ended up somehow, and, at some event of insecure, that we were working, they said, "Go and there were opportunities for choice, options, if the person was a mechanic and took these three actions."
At that moment, gathering this concept of the Forbes magazine, that I realized that there were people.
What makes the drawing of architecture of decisions, today I'm walking in decisions.
And that caught me a lot of version: X, more precisely people in the world of technology, have even the name for this profession, which are the architects of the decisions, work to pass the architecture of the decision, designing all forms and environments in the region of all the decisions.
Why did I stop this name, mine, if today he found a day with this father, his face is the person who has to bring the knowledge of the behavioral economy, and he sent me this photo and said, "Look, I found here at UFRJ, which really changed my grandmother to see and is also behavioral?"
If we don't need research to know that we use a lot of cellphone, or outside our pocket, look at him, it's a smartphone thing for 22 hours, nearby, that everyone spreadsheet is a drug dealer from their pocket or outside their pocket, look at him.
So, from those 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think they are these digital data, of these college students that we made or using my digital camera, or that the digital equipment many times are in these not with us.
When the panic and the rhythm comes from a person, I started to ask myself, "When the decisions we're from him and shout the power for the digital to take for us, and we put the websites between the hand of this decision as I am, and we put the websites" and Google?
It requires identity.
Speaking of "Ay Doubli," I should talk to you about another interesting number: it's a number that in Austria is 91%, and in Genamata, it's 4%; the whole bathroom asked what this was, and they said, "Ana, it shouldn't be free."
(Laughter) But it's not strange, in this case it's a number of two young people.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why do you have 99% of organ donors, because in Austria you're already owner, you need to ask to leave?"
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter without doing anything, it's the decisions I call the decision to capture birth, you need to ask to leave.
(Laughter) Someone has already took this drawing to you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my cellphone these days, and then I had two options: one promised the recipes and another to receive an offer.
(Laughter) The recipes were dismantled by the offers and were killing, so someone decided that I wanted Férgica, I didn't want to receive, so I went there and went out.
(Laughter) I learned to get out of the offspring and signed in the recipe.
Uber has a new functionality, a pupa, you can share the car with other people, but I talk a lot about Uber's driver, I don't know if you took the work of those players to talk, and then he looked at him and said, "If he chose Uber once and told a story, I opened Uber, I opened Uber, I was there to love for me to get the cup with other people, and she couldn't take the cube."
(Laughter) So Barcelona chose the business without even knowing it, (Laughter) but she chose she was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, and this is very interesting that we can imagine who makes these decisions: if we are a Google today, it has 567 thousand results.
What do we click?
In 91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
AC: Who chose a place where we started eating people was me, Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the website.
(Laughter) I love the page seven, and I see from there what is the page, no, I go to the right and click page, you're going to ask for samba.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us little emphas.
AC: These guys, in English, have a name in the behavior economy, they also have a name, they are called "innants."
The concept of Digitalandi is what I gave, and the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "There's a book called Nantes, I thought it's a story, a theory for a simple way to understand these pushions in the digital world, and we don't realize it's a little push in English.
Audience: Good afternoon!
(Laughter) But it's not true, and in this talk I wanted to take a picture of me, so, to see (Laughter) and put it on.
Parabéns!
AC: You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Detina Maca.
AC: Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
(Laughter) In the midst that a text written: "I want to apply to a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions that you'll make in your life..." (Laughter) "He explains me, right?
(Laughter) If you don't want to receive it, it's easy to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
And how many people criticized the book?
According to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave, (Laughter) So, this means that I can build all the decisions of the lives of 300 and 70 conversations there, (Laughter) No, that was only an experiment and I show the results.
The genome is that people ask me,
Do you have this knowledge of these discomforts?
AC: From that moment on, can we handle someone?
And my answer is that yes, the danger of this is that knowledge is a tool.
Like, for example, if you're here, you can use to make someone buy something that they don't need, or you can use for good, to make a diabetes patient know the moment, but also insulin.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this bottle, the same autochem, which makes the metal wave to detect a thread to educate an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world, because you can imagine it was the launch of Pokémon Go.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better how these little toilets work, we'll be able to build a better world, and we'll be more conscious so that we take better decisions, thank you.
