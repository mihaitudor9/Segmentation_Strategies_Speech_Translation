Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or should I have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist?
Is it to create a college degree?
that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009.
When I was still in search of a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
Do you have a college entrance exam?
For wheelchairs.
So I talked.
With various women, including parapletas that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times, they would buy a clothes:
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewel to do some adds?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
Now that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
That was it.
to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I did it.
A square with a very high cause, elastic of the blindness to make more comfort.
I made a discreet to give her the exchange of the probe which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the actress of the skin with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I did it for Carlena.
A light is that it was open in the shoulders.
A warm of button of pressure.
To make it easier when you pass your head.
In fact.
For people who are quadriplegic, the ideal.
It's thinking of a dress that facilitates who's going to dress the person.
And for paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
In ergonomics, I've already done it in the sitting position.
to make more comfort.
For Jesel, a visually impaired person.
I made a dress that she could use in many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in armile, so people could have access to some basic information.
Like the size and color of the play.
Hi of Kelle, training.
For women, with anthism or low stature?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
My excitement in this work is that I read with the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there is.
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news?
It's that businesses are already thinking.
Are they producing more modern products?
As colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped Prots.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion competition, including the world, which is already in the best edition.
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
which are the big companies.
Special and conceptual marks that realized the real need of this dressed room.
They are already launching collections.
How does the Americans take?
And it's already in your second inclusive collection due to the size of success that was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal.
Our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
He went to work with the children.
Listening of four years old.
Until adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community, we started working with addiction.
I was consciousizing people, how ...
Putting the beginning: knowing how to separate one trash from another.
So I tried to talk to children and it was making awareness of their parents.
The parents who were taking me off the children?
People recognize me in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
Almost with the children I know.
In my community?
We have one.
A seed collection when you go to the forest?
Just work with SAF.
We have a plant.
Once I met a plant called Hengar's name, she's a legominous plant.
And we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all plants quantify.
There are so many below it ...
It has a good result.
In our community?
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
That all plants!
It was used every one of its place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
So, you have to be forest, why?
There in the arm.
Was there a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more than so many.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So, I tried to plant them.
Sharing: I have a hoax, cup, label, Andiróba, Copaiba.
With Maru, Araná.
And it's all there, there's no plague.
We come there.
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside?
Cicomparation of ours.
In our community, we worked all with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxic in our community.
I?
Do you just see the human being?
Like an animal.
The child compared her and, just paying.
If you talk, she's there listening, and then passing on to other children.
I'm paying and I'm coming to this attention."
Then he begins to talk to another animal, so I compare the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection.
"Mom, it's careful for those children."
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all in the desire, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person.
I look at my house.
I kept observing my house and ... (Audience) I kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things leave us there, everything is fine.
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, had a future.
And it's to work out.
And today we have ...
Is it a job inside?
"It's far from the atom."
"The quilometers of the atoman?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom?
It's the turtle of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river, what was it before?
They had a hooligan.
In front of you?
That's how it's a little bit like our community.
And ...
This hooligan didn't drive.
He ended with the saw.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature.
To understand nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I'm going to talk to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
The forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel it?
It's typical.
They breathe the pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest.
It's always being talking to people teaching children.
"And ...?"
Moving on to other people.
And I have a message to leave here.
A very small phrase?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people arrive.
Do you come to be next to us?
There, we're talking, practicing people.
And I'm very happy.
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely thank you, guys.
I'm gay.
In contrast with the name, I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To feed these children, they're very proud.
My family is very grateful, these women who helped us.
to make this dream happen in life.
I could create this fame.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
And that ...
It puts life at risk.
Imagine all the blindest ones you are here.
How we don't feel that.
A fear that lost his child.
And we had two options, we could.
to collapse, to cry, or...
Resolver, fight.
Believing, faith, strength and continuing looking for an ugly melody to get there.
For them, I managed to make a subway transplant, which is what needs to be cured.
What about it?
It was very incredible because all the school's most friends and all of us did all the movements.
Very big, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people, donating blood, donating módle, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
What when?
A child has leukemia.
It has a risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns.
It doesn't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
This is what we learn from this lesson.
And it spread to our friends, to the most of the school, to societies, people on Facebook, telling the truth, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this disease, as public as well, and all this movement found a donor.
It was.
What about people?
They saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that is equal to all these families.
At the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a divorced mother, a warrior.
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease for the world?
And what?
Not even the blood, nor the strawberry.
We can make them.
Our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human being can give to another human.
He raised such a big awareness.
We have this ability.
To give blood to what needs, and blood isn't only ...
For someone who has hunger, I don't go out.
The blood is needed in the pairs.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everyone is processing and they need.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's one ...
About 100,000 people.
So, if you ...
Or to save a life, it's like winning a mega-haw.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when he moves three.
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be able to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life, if me, more strength, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that ...
Or so credible?
We all went by, so I thank you all.
"Yes ...
By supporting us, by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
She adapted to me.
You looked at it.
Basically, it's like you.
This is exalition.
That's not it.
My name is...
The paladal is Tinau.
I'm Syrian.
She was born in Damasco.
Capited from Syria.
I, an engineer.
I studied at Damasco University.
Today ...
I'm delighted.
It's not Brazil.
with my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little crazy.
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today.
I'll talk about this.
What bothers me the most.
Three.
Well, there's Slon about it.
Because of terrorist groups.
They don't have it.
Nothing to do with Islam.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was pretty.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was 20x.
Three million.
It should be people.
I had ...
My family.
My friends I knew as a child.
Three clothes shoes.
Engineering men.
Two apartments.
I, a car.
Intamasco.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Foli.
For countries like the United States, Spain.
It's France.
Until one day ...
The war began.
March 15.
In 2011 -
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
From the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had delivered: Vinci.
It's 25.
There you go.
Origia!
How good!
And five years of war.
This is my country.
It's a hero.
People: whom I know were forced to carry on.
Cadava.
Of your children.
They found their voices.
Vert and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiares.
Slowing.
And they didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
I didn't know if it's going back home.
"When leaving, hug working?"
I knew how to come to my family again.
Or not.
Today ...
Millions of Syrian lost everything.
They were dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I.
We were very sad.
When should we leave Syria?
His, bare bones and our life stayed behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, in my brother.
They still live there.
And I don't know.
"Yeah, come."
They, again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
Well, ten months.
Obviously, Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
"So?"
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad.
And they said that São Paulo ...
It was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
And TEDxApinas.
Or one week, to leave bridges.
Fifty years of my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I got here in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and he was.
With a lot, today I have a daughter.
Brazil is the queen.
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party for me to live, my children's birthday, and they all said very well.
From the food that my good thirds said, stopped.
I'll take advantage of what the kitchen is.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
Hi, that I created "Dagine on Facebook" or "Talade with Syria Idea," that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper.
It's a number... (Laughter) And the palace eating Syrian.
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened the doors when the world ...
It was closed.
For us.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
Two chorists.
Many people had a wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
Or contact?
As a homosexual.
A Muslim.
A lot!
That Islam loves blood.
that is allowed to kill the name of religion.
But exactly ...
The diving.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us.
The Syrian.
The Islamic State is an organization.
The horrorists who are pushing Islam's image.
A religion.
It's based.
Alcurão.
I'm not a book.
It's sacred since a person kills.
Without she had killed another, injured with corruption, a land, and as if all men killed and read about life, it would be like deceiving life to the courtyard, her life, to the besbolo 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill, humans, lonely.
How am I?
My life in Brazil?
It showed me.
Let's board!
Living in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When people see a woman using "hijabi"?
That handkerchief that covered my hair.
Well, my wife is my wife.
You ask questions, how?
Why do you use this handkerchief?
With that heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline Tirai Jabi.
Today, lament other rules.
Men and women.
I won't, we should play."
To start.
Yeah!
Excess are of wedding voices.
Some people desired me.
But I've already seen humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Look, Tao islam has these rules, more.
It's from each person wanting to buy or not?
The bicycle is fine.
I had some things to be.
The same way they have glasses that don't obey everything.
It's not good for having killed as fat cane and alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Let's do it.
With more than a partner.
This isn't happening with me.
Why?
Because these things are forgotten of isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing Moislam, then.
That the agency is explained.
People always.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Professor, Mohamat Dess."
We must respect.
All religions.
Because everyone has the same value.
That we should have!
Beaud?
With all of us.
It doesn't matter if you scream white, black, or Indians.
Oislam also says.
that we should help the people who need it.
All an stimulus or Alsaka.
And we got demoted.
Two points, five, for a moment.
All our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Chrystalos, today I gave.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
What it was like to understand is a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
To finish.
with "Oubrecent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children.
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is the molecule?
In the little histories of life.
I come to recite my tears.
In the Sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower.
Always willing to not give up to the saints of whom?
Hopefully, achieved.
Who always believes cancer?
I don't even believe.
I take my foot with hope.
But, in the daily cave, I know who suffers.
There the bag makes food, my salary ends, just like this race.
A girl, a girl, was what she told me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Fascinira.
Why don't they hire me in the mall?
I don't understand.
This is how much you can pay for a Secretary course.
But it doesn't even enter the office.
Excuse me, I made an event three.
I clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
Hey, ME, a ICU, a housekeeper.
If it were for option, that's OK.
I have many friends who are in these situations and have already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas, please, mice, it gave me an opportunity.
And the teacher told me.
You follow this corridor.
It goes straight, turns on the left, enter that little side that the vassor is waiting, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011.
And I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, "I'm a maid."
The page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 this year.
She hadn't even completed four months yet.
And how I created this page, wasn't programmed at all?
It was at home.
Differences.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
And I was said there in the couch remembering all that I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live next to the beach.
Almost in front of you.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook?
Or the newspaper?
I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, a girl, everything you can do.
Yes, mother, it's my new day.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
Because I was a maid for seven years.
I warned people, "Look, guys.
I remembered some stories I'll start.
Post this on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid, so that, in case, other people have gone through this too, compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
To my surprise.
In less than 24 hours this went viral very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first narrative on the Internet was a reference to my last job.
as a maid in Santos city, in 2009.
Yes, I was hired to be a cook?
And my boss prevented me from ...
My own food that I made.
I had to bring the yellows, I couldn't use the cup.
In her house and neither the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on.
When I shared ...
This first story on the Internet went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
What I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories and not today's stories.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I interviewed several media.
Both the international media.
They're from far away.
Hi, many times.
What did I get super surprised?
When I spoke to these answers ...
Take a look at Skype than everyone.
Everyone!
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil.
Then he got the reward and I started talking.
From these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolic.
domestications are more valued, they earn.
For hour, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive many abusive advertisements in my page.
It gives employment announces that I've tried as abuse announces, for example.
The advertisement I read.
It was for the worker.
It's ... going to work in the second one.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, per month.
3180 reals per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions today, there are domestications that are being prevented from feeding, and they also don't earn food, there are domestications, but, in a single house, I found something that I call humanized treatment.
And then I got very excited to experience so many books, and I started doing paper, that became a daily practice, so what I did was home, rubbed everything quickly, left half an hour to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a room that had a gigantic library, and I always liked to read, but still, books, until nowadays, cost a lot of money, and my domestic mother, my father and a wallet.
(Laughter) And there it's sitting down, delicizing me with those books, and, to my surprise, Regina gets into the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe brave, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And knowing about the experiences I'd already gone through the past, I was very nervous, and then she started to meditate several texts to study, I said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was a child, I'd read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and she told what I'm doing, and it was very difficult."
To help the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and several class friends, who helped me, I summarized some texts, I try to enter the classroom to make the test, which is very difficult to apply a very heavy job with...
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the typical Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone.
Why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And that?
It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I couldn't understand, but she knew everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, too.
I would also pass.
Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, and I started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they took suspicies, after graduation, they took suits to see my experiences, to have established that, that, and so on.
What about you?
"Yes."
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
The domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant past, it's coming from us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern senior.
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I cried, cried, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to arrive, "You're on the fair day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door." Nossa, my pattern came ... And then, when I arrived ...
I was already with the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, so she arrives and says, "Menine, it was so stressed, we forgot to get your money, Monday, I pay you, the modern senior is the maid's money."
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to marriage because the modern cord.
It's the maid's money, Christmas, I'm seeing my employees' family, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's almost the one from the maid.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss is going to work, he will work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who is going to work, but he goes back home, hesitate me, and the only solution I had was to take pictures of all the comfort.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can run away from him.
Because when I say that I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menine, resist, you win a lot of items per month, you'll never get that value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need money because modern senzala.
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service.
My little kick pot was crushed.
That my pot of saving is my pnic, and I was there.
When I got out of the service area, tired, I got my glass pot and I know this in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the gate of ice and the toilet, and there wasn't the maid bathroom for this that I brought little pot, because the modern lady?
It's the maid's money, "Today I'm here.
Statistics, for some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are.
His grandmother wasn't a maid, but her mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for her family to come.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
Gord ... (Applause) HEP.
(Applause) Woman arrested, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
(Applause) Antrans of me have 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
What in other countries, various households, work and study, and here, this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, "Why does the nanny have to be dressed as white, but it's not to be clear which places some people have in this country, so I'm talking to six million households?"
They're from African branches and not all united.
I'm here today to talk to you.
About silencing.
It's already a bit funny to come out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
I first take the time of my talk to disconnect.
They connect their cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying and fear.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is...
Who are we really?
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you serve.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing the 8th grade, the conceptual day of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did the acid start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Fociso."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go."
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look, pauro.
Open your agenda, bravo.
It has in your eye.
It's insecurity with equipment.
I propose inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book.
And I was sure that I wouldn't realize it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos.
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
You are you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
Well, it's in cure.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
It's determining my choices.
Now it's little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his cell phone.
Several of you.
Think about it.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Meaning.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off, cell phones?
(Laughter) Put them on the floor, (Exhales) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags on the floor.
Chorus: Here.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
with everything closed.
You are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
Propal.
And then, look.
On the other human being that you have on the right and left.
"Let's look at her in the face!"
You're good, you got even a little kiss.
AC: He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where they are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
"Yes."
You see ... (Exhaling) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
His legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
of fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Until this moment is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what is still there.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Remember the ceiling?
Remember that ...
Two dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
In the human brain, we are connecting space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly, of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
Which brings the area you hear.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality: it's new, as it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
It's to realize.
That much of what we do is specific.
What we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
To have a real freedom of choice.
The silencing?
And a state of presence that comes from him.
It can become.
A habit in our lives?
They are self-awareness technologies.
There you go.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
And in the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be the direct unit between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate.
Autensity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxTI.
He had the first video, right?
I can say I'm going to catch.
I had a demand for a region of Idete fans.
What did they ask to give societies?
My friends, your colleagues, your family.
Once more than just one.
The influence in English.
How about it when?
The producer is to find.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays?
Ten percent of them are Brazilians.
Seven and 16 in young people.
And with almost all 26,000 translations made to your family.
It's also how we transcend.
The talks made in events like these here.
But it's clear to allow people with hearing impairment.
In my case here, every month.
First, it's transcribed.
I said, "Golanda in general."
Look after being lost for me, instead, and from English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
It's like the logope itself indicates.
They have technology like Pedro TET: "Entrortinely," which is "e," that we can translate as a fun.
And you have to go out?
Paulo referred to each other.
They are from sedentary or competitive, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship.
and even literature.
Species that come back at times of chance.
The theme is this cognitive event.
It's that free time we have.
Once again, reduction.
I said, "This video is about 20 Brazilian reals."
It's to translate and think about realizing how a role is.
In the West TEDx.
And it can be.
They're short educational voices and accessible to children.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what a translator.
It's a privileged reader.
It wasn't just the start of your day, and we found it alone.
Not only because I had such tactic people, but I'm getting to know at this event.
But why do I think I have it, is precious?
I think it's worth using my cognitive accident.
In initiatives like this one.
To wait to become who he was.
That it's potentially that I don't have everything and that it's education.
And I also don't have stupidity, "What do you do?"
I can integrate everything.
And when is it a fish, is it a volunteer?
Be the rain, your knowledge.
Because I've always my choice, my decision.
And try to commit myself.
Hi!
Why do we keep it?
It's different from us.
Translation is a complex activity that takes not only to know.
Jama Fones, who plays the destiny.
behind a very violent translation.
There's always.
The soil of knowledge instead.
A research.
Many jobs, many hours of dedication.
For us, from such a fluent translation, to be ours, okay?
And frustrated with what?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be 1,000 million.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
All these translations and transitions.
Or as we call "For an EDC."
"I want to suggest Portuguese, Portugal, because I'm different."
We have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here.
I read stories.
We have, "Menha?"
Audience: Yes.
I have to hear it.
I live a air.
A deep, political crisis, right?
But without having my exchange in personal history.
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and do it.
And his dream was always able to do that.
And to do how their children rest.
That's why what was living in our neighbor from Minas called Tairobeiras.
In some places, my father had sold his start, his logic, Uberas, and his place.
If you also knew as a businessman, he found out that a hotel in a presence store had been investing years.
In 1964.
He stayed entirely, without anything, because you kill yourself in one with the nine states.
One felt very humble with his economic clown, and my father decided.
My mother, who's now 30 years old, isn't she deaf?
It was an excerpt of cooking.
Success of training.
And she decided to make "consects" to sell.
Travels went literally.
It's... although we don't have to eat many times, they don't have to dress in a way.
We are philosophers to study.
And that's how it works.
A big question, without a doubt, because everyone is already sentenced from the slope of national research by homicilious samples.
Or exception, this fascination, this passion my father had for education?
What did I seem to them?
When you've just thought, each producer episode chose a buy, and then any visibility arriving at home.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalisas de Parkia," right?
But for my father, they would check their babies there.
Without knowing, he was having a little time for this talk here.
So the conditions were better than we had, right?
And here I talk to my greatest passion in my public practice, which are my two kilos: Daniel, João Initi.
To have stories before everything.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident to me or not?
Four of us, my brothers, we became teachers.
At some point in life.
And one of the brothers is the educator without awe, for me, fantastic, creative.
Empreias, revolutionary, what does it apply?
So ...
The only message I can leave here today?
It's what we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion with initiatives is TEDx?
It has to do with cry.
I do more than TEDx, just like my father, his simple manager, inspired us.
Don't be inspired.
that make us believe here.
Despite everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with her armile.
A alphabet where you can feel the things you're written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explain how it worked, showed us the letters, numbers, symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it was super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times.
And I stopped buying a rule.
It's a tiny that allows you to describe in braille.
On the street, you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
My agenda.
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
I wrote to her that I was learning, giving tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started to research, there were no thousands of processes like this, they would go online, be ready, connect with engines, and we would have a clock.
But he saw that he didn't have the Internet, he tends to decide what our own is.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaking and nothing happened.
We did everything, collected everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock.
And we showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
And he really encouraged us to continue this project, to try to make a small report, a translator in Braille, was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
I could help out about salt inclusion and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my best you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, besides the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and even we, two high school students, who have not even finished.
In high school, we are second and teenagers, we are able to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help you.
Let's ask you a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free, consent.
They can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
(English) You can put your hand in the air.
Chorus: Here.
OK, we're all cutting down.
(Laughter) Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual actions.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference.
With sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a volunteer exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the goal of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people I do.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their advertisements.
We received their clients, apartments, hotels, or street thinkers.
And that no one has the pluralities.
This is what I'm talking about.
And I'm not here to talk about cases who are involved.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
The scenario that involves us 16 or adults that didn't make sense that consent is crime cases, it's cases that must be chosen criminals and, additionally, and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, it's always a stunning situation for volunteer and forgotten prostitution.
And it also doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
Attention is to confuse this situation.
It involves sexual execution.
In other words, but to take all people who do prostitution by victims of traffic attacks for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
Research has shown that it falls in Portugal.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive. They are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
And to give you a notion.
What I've just said, Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism in which Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and, regarding the year of 2018.
Human.
Almost all of us for job exploration.
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, it was enough to see a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is disappointed from reality.
Because there's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
Defense.
Sured.
This is an object that waits for someone to wrap well.
But this doesn't respond to reality either.
Or is it just another foreign?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, that is, we know there is a diversity of buildings.
That influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interacts, conversations, I'm with people who work sexually.
What they tell me is that this was an option.
What a hidden option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a dese and isn't recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think which image comes immediately to you?
Audience: Yes.
The mind, when you think of a person who prostitates.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or any other one.
Or a poor-speaking woman.
And from mining, who's in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
And that is very likely a dry touch of a relative and that, of course, there's someone exploring it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Durastic.
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
They are not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not just cigarette women, there are also many transgenre women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Does anyone on the street?
I say that the studies that are powerful and defeated.
The accidental cities.
Try to estimate the number of people in this sex, they show us that...
It's called Sindroe.
which will only represent us 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they are less.
They're minorities, but they're not neglected.
Let's give the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by Sonhadias, from the University of Lisboa.
And that interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context and in the inner context, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10,2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does about the victim of a man or a depressor, they forget it's a percentage.
I saw men, a matter.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, detachment.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the cliché criminalization.
In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex.
But it's incredible!
Getting series.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's that people in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, if they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there are very strong evidence, namely non-governmental organizations that are on the ground, that work every day with people who talk about sexual below and indicate that this law puts a higher risk.
Speeders themselves put rich people for sex taste and that increases their vulnerability, violence.
To stigma.
And the disease.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
It's an idea without great restriction that happened well.
The resources of people and this is the idea that the client is a criminal.
This is an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between us.
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, and that are mainly not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of cooking our customers is unfortunate.
They're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can attend sex professionals.
Even countries?
They have a legal figure, the sexual assistant, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual relationships.
With disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about social relevance of this work.
about the relevance of sexual work.
And now that I destroy any argument that I try to be a favor.
Where is the clients' criminalization?
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
If people think it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy.
There are these economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
What was found on the work connections?
If this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
to condemn them so strongly because stigma is so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Why is it moral?
And specifically, moral.
Sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality and considered.
It was legitimate.
It's normal.
And natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" considered ilogitimate.
It's normal.
Anti-natural and that's where sex shares.
And eating sex is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization.
Dirge essential.
from decreidualization, health, and disvalorization of people who do this activity.
stigma is a mark with iron a profound delivery.
The stigma that rejects sex observer is strong, has many consequences: stigma, dehumanization, stigma, is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers, like, for example.
It's when they drive in institutions in the health area.
Justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone used this word, "No TEDxBas," "The stigma of puta."
It's the worst that I can fall on a woman.
That's why the worst offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and disabled people, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense?
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of sword from MOOCs that is above any of us, any woman knows that, if you forget, the norms that are socially prescribed, there's a risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk.
What did you call?
What are we doing?
What can we do any of us can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex damages?
And I think that the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence. This has already been said in the morning in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And I too.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge stigma.
But I'm here to make this moment and give voice.
Listening to sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time.
The sex avoidant.
So, everybody, organized and used 70, but, precisely because of stigma, their voice has no credibility.
Because we're eager, they're not taught to say, we don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think that, to me, we have to continue.
After all this.
To conclude.
I think it was the title.
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize.
I wanted to criminalize sex wisdom.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Art, well cure, art, healing to be a doctor.
It was the idea supported by a fundamental letter.
It's a medical relationship with your teeth.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but, at the same time, I have to have a complete distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can take care of it.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And urban relations, in our time, are all more superficial and more reasons: "I'm vice balance, it's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors also went there.
It's several times.
Where did we get there, in our arrogance of ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear India.
India, Mitis.
When I say there, I found myself in a feeling that I wouldn't have since childhood.
There, to relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer that involvement, that love, that treatment, he extrapolated.
The ones that call it, the request for call, schedule, schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and go back.
Cirrochis.
We bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice.
The simplification that occurs can be repeated here too.
It's the bottle she needs, and for the middle of the Amazon, it's for all that.
It was the path I had and why I found out.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical college.
If you make a list of topics of student goals, the first goals are there.
Altruism?
It's gone well.
At the end of the medical course.
With the same research?
The tops, the statement, success, recognition.
A madness.
When did we do it wrong?
If we took someone who had a brilliant, poetic spirit?
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry?
With low relationship with science, medicine, it goes back to the past.
In the growth, the fish in medicine, or that father, in medicine, which is poor, doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When the added falls with the apple, Eva disgastated it, and this was to make a leg transverse route, is what we do until today was a little the same thing, (Laughter) So why is Greece considered unverse, also defines the father in medicine, because for the first time he had a method?
Maybe if it's an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And in such a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and it was created an isolation of very few.
That is used even today in medicine formatures.
In the world?
It was made a sector that, before Christ, I'm from one which.
These are slightly complex words, and you said three words.
In all houses that entered.
I was really sorry to see the exercise of the patients, exciting.
Especially the seduation of women, men, children and surroundings.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
If I respect this jury and not violate it, it would be the right to go for a reputation between men and all times.
If I bring the violin giraff, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, this worried about this, and you still do the dinner?
We do judgement of things we thrive.
Because it has to be transcribed.
Because the patient's relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken for honor judgment.
And, in this case, I was honored to participate in a position that is registered for men's judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this: medical knowledge proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all the knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of having a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit.
With this, we'll specialize in healing this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't."
Once I was in a classroom in college, in small groups, as a teacher.
And ...
I worked with sports processes, patients with chronography, resonance and microscopy and illustration.
I'll look for their belly's hands and I can't face awareness.
"Oh, I'm less posed.
She called me, so she called my whole class.
Let's see the belly.
He looked at the tobacco bubble in the green of the patient and noticed what was smoking in front of him and he didn't smoke anymore, hole of his five-year-old and showed that he had emagrete.
And if SMAPER is lucid, you can live together, you're able to take care of your own clothes, a dirty saying, you can say a lot, "The time you're mexing in a patient, there's a moment of intimacy, you need to remind you of something that doesn't teach us and say, "If all this doesn't convince us?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
He's exposing me to you, the vulnerable area, he's letting you move on.
And, at that moment, you have the opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, and you're staying onto him, you want to do good, he's that you're asking for sneakers so that he'll be careful for you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, improved, but there's a more precocely ralk.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery, there's no amistantic changes, no X-rays, it's nothing, it's diseases like this.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little good?
Some of you have already raised Frasti Boop.
It's very interesting for you to talk about the medical relationship.
But to be a patient, a patient, a patient, a passive relationship.
Why are you talking about this to me?
What you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
After all, relationship actors are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
My doctors against two.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we're patient, passive, and we have to get our hands, in our cure process.
Thank you very much.
The first point, the most important, is information.
Where did the owner talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had many size copies in my house, medicine and health, had a book free of health, that was there without giving up?
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor. You had to have content to talk, today, a Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them very good and very important, but many, very bad.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think when we see information first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge call because people inside hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow for nothing to be bad because it puts me, and just like other people who are defending a personal interest.
The signature.
Second very important thing: don't believe in good things, refrigerators, look, medicine has changed, now their problems have finished.
Cereously bobbing.
Differently a lab with the scientist will have a recovering and immediate discovery without the scientific society.
It's not killing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my most was when I don't know: trouble.
Third.
If there's a paranoic thing, like, "A industry doesn't interest you to know this."
On the bottom, no one dominates information.
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things noticed me, we don't believe it.
Thank you very much.
Any information, discuss to your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information is equal to knowledge, information and information, it's knowledge.
Take the information, participate in their cure, but disculp your method.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura.
Ask, demand, know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There was a right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy has no time to attend me, I've been working for 20 years."
I know I have time."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of...
To exist, it's not to get there fighting with all the body's name, it's not that, it's...
Really, knowing.
It's demanding.
We might say, "One time, we'll change."
The method you want is this?
They want to learn right.
They don't want to have this attempt like, "No time," they want to serve the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-milling area, the area and the mother.
And we had a patient there, who had a patient's cancer.
A dead guy.
There was no trapagent orologist to bring it to São Paulo, it's been treated here.
And, after other years, I had the opportunity to follow his fruit.
He was an engineer, he didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak Portuguese.
He had a translator, his son, his neighbor, who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
And he was obviously furniture.
And I presented a posture.
The index looked at the doctor.
You like that.
The merit was.
I'm trying to tell you why, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had all interest in taking care of him.
This magic?
What is the art of healing?
So you don't need to cut a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we said, "I have one.
Relativity and consultors.
We, elderly.
More unity of our treatment.
It's a concern.
All patients.
Changing to be active in your cure process.
What's going to do with a connection?
You look at the world, but it improves you, and you'll be better treated.
(Applause) Good morning, guys, I wanted to talk to the world, 3.500 Brazilian reais.
What does physics happen isn't it?
And the person 1, and it's more or less a decision for two seconds.
"Dorals, these animals weren't necessary.
(Laughter) I'm talking about decisions that I want to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my grandmother to make choices.
The journals were three emotions in this nature.
A printed magazine structure, the Servinho Circudois, of a literature that is a digital people more printed to be also winners.
The result of this medicine is that the majority of people chose how you are 25 dollars.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups.
GB: digital apple, 58 players.
And Oxão do Combo with the 20 Brazilian reais too.
In the middle of 15,000 Brazilian reais, he launched the print.
What did this choice change, most people chose the other?
And that left me very unpleasant.
Why did I have more to launch and I wouldn't make this decision?
And I started to study about it.
It's called "Dicoy".
It's a third that is put into an equation, and I've learned a lot about it in a theory that studies cognitive tipology and neuroscience to apply this decision-making process.
There was a formula like this, interesting, you're there.
But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the option T, you can no longer see the occupation.
This teacher, in the midst of her, makes her name to be better, to whom I always pay and feel like, "Wow, the company, if I can have two to the same place."
Her name is to compare.
From this behavior, I chose today's advances, I think everybody looks like rocks in biology.
Because I have around me.
You need to do things full, at the same time.
"You have to go to thectober center."
But we see it differently, because I have it around the Inclusive.
There's another optical accomplishment that I was fascinated by all I saw.
And this one here, the legs recorded on top, are equal to the pieces of low pess.
A moment of life that will make your problem before reaching all of this.
But I'm going to show you that it really is.
Without staying in the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
I said, "The same way what's around us and influence the way we see things, what's around us also fights most of all the decisions.
You yell and yelled working in a project to create an application through insurance, and we were picking one of the difficult figures, it's a lot of option, and we wouldn't like to explore.
You can choose both adoptions, the stars, or these two, and you will never be insecure.
The team working was reading a way to simplify this choice for people, this way was not to see that there was another profession, if the person was a mechanic, they would see these three options.
(Video) It was at that moment, fighting for this concept of Flores' magazine, that I just realized.
who make the drawing of architecture of decisions where I'm giving my decisions.
In the world of technology, not even the name of this profession, it's called YO Ex, and the Researchers or the experience of their eyes are exactly the people.
And they are the architects of the decisions, working with the decision-making architecture, drawing all the format and environments are the management of all the decisions.
AC: Why did I stop this name, mine, if you've met one day with this guy, he's the person who's a burden in this subject of behavioral economy, and he looked at this photo and said, "Look at what I found here and isn't freezing?"
And I told him, of his theories, that you have to bring the knowledge of the behavior economy to the horizontal world, and it was overwhelmed, that was going to start with you, and what really changed my way of seeing the opposite economy.
I think we don't need research to know that we use a lot of cell phones.
Everybody's life is special, taste, egg is our pocket, look at it.
But, in fact, I got to a research bringing that trail of what this: it would be that none of the people with their smartphone have smartphones for 22 hours nearby.
And this black people is that you can deliver my love there.
So, in those 35,000 decisions we hear, how many do you think they are digital decisions?
From these stories, it seems that we're daring and the digital way, or that I allow digital technology, many times I'll look at this new one with us.
I started to ask myself this.
When I put this horizon on how it is from a person, I internalize this aviation as I am?
And we add theway, the "this story" with the microphone, so we'll say, "Do Rio begins to us, isn't it the "esit" as she received the audience?
(Laughter) These of infidelity ... (Laughter) Speaking about numbers, I'd like to talk to you back in Rio Grande do Sul, and in the area kills, it's 4%.
Well, you must have a story that thought it was this and said, "It's the number of several books..." (Laughter) But it's not strange ..." (Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two kilometers.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Austria have 99% of men's donors? What in Austria is you already a gay donor?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magic word called Defone.
This word is what you're already.
without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call the "capitão de nascimento," "You need to get out."
(Laughter) Someone has already took this drawing to you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my phone these days.
And then, there are two options: one for me to receive the recipes and another to receive me offered; the recipes were dismantled by the offers and was marked.
Someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to receive it, I went there and went out.
(Laughter) Here to get out of the air crash of the offer and the tart of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there in a tune to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave if I was really in the people and up to now.
I had a cool time to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver, I don't know if you get the work they love to talk about.
Then, a truck from Uber once and tells a story.
And a lady?
Choosing a bridge.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "OK, there's another painter, man?"
He looked at her and said, "You chose PUC.
And she said, "I bought my foot, right?"
So Barcelona was going to choose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, it's very interesting to imagine whoever makes these decisions.
If we go to Google today, do we need a person's comedy?
It has 5.67,000 results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we went to eat from someone was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the web page.
I love the page seven, I see there what is the website, no, I go to the website.
Just to ask you to think.
These young men, in English, have a name in the behavioral economy, also have a name, they are called "innants."
It's not exactly a little push in English, I want to ask you to give a little push, the person next to you, yes.
You don't need to create a picture to have (Laughter) They're an ecology, beauty, there's an excellent thing, there's a theory.
From an author named "Britteira," he has a book called Dante.
"Yeah."
The concept of "digitive" is the name I gave to a simple way of understanding these pushers in the digital world.
The funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "Now I understood it."
I thought, "Geee, right?
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted a photo of me cutting the ice ... (Laughter) That's not the case.
You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Dedinamarca.
Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
In the midst that a text written, "Are you introduced at a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you're going to make in your life." (Laughter) "He's explaining me."
If you don't want a CD, it's easy to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
(Laughter) There are more than 400 inscribed people.
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of the life of 30 people were here. No, that was just an experiment.
Secondly, I do these experiments to understand how people behave.
And I show you the results.
People usually ask me, "Teacher?
Do you have this knowledge of these neighbors?
Necessity.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger and this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do it because someone buys something they don't need, or you can use good things.
How, for example?
You can use it.
To make a diabetes patient know the moment, "It's more insulin."
Or can you use it?
To avoid truck accidents, like this bottle, at the same time, which makes the mediation.
From cereal waves, we detected coxilo.
To elected an accident.
So, of those 35,000 decisions?
I know there's a lot of decision to be made, and I know that more and more we've made one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016, which did it with what?
People around the world describes 144 billion phases.
What did you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Poucos.
Pokémon Go is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
How do these screens work?
How do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
We were able to be more aware that we made better decisions.
Thank you very much.
