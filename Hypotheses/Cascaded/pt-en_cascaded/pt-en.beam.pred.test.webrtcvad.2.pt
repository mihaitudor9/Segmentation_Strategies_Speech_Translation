(Applause)
Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference...
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dressed room that embraces everyone.
People with and without disabilities.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue bother me so much?
Everything started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does it need someone's help or do it?
Is there any interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that attained their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one of them would take them to the sewage to make some pieces, and that made them lose the piece of pieces, two larger numbers.
They were happy that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations ...
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist, was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was a fashion with other disabled women, and I made her a lady with a very high cause, elastic in her seat to make greater comfort, I made a discreet to be able to exchange the probe which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the skin actress with some surface, and I obviously didn't put their backpacks on their shoulders because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
I made Carlena a blouse opening on her shoulders.
With the closing of pressure button, to make it easier when it comes to mind.
In fact, for quadriplegic people, the ideal is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who's dressing the person.
And paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress on their own.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt ...
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in arms so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
And for women, with anthism or low status, the ideal is to think of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's children stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, that means...
More than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs.
Are you ready?
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it's already in the second edition, I took part in the third and made a party dress to Juliana?
And I took the second place.
I...
Silvana ...
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists ...
Little brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed brands, that realized the real need of this college entrance, and are already launching collections due to the size of the success which was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all need to think about it, we must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Listening to four years of age, to adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community, we started working with the audience, and I became aware of people, like... Audience: Yes.
Putting the beginning: knowing how to separate other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was making awareness of their parents.
The parents were choosing.
By delivering me to children?
People recognize me in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate.
But nowadays I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I do with the children I know.
In my community...
We have one ...
A seed collection when you go to the forest?
I'll work with SAF.
Do we have a plantation?
There?
I met a plant called her name of Engar, she's a leguminous plant.
And we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I had.
On top of it, we have a good result.
In our community?
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
All plants.
It was used every one of its place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
(Laughter) Isn't it?
So, you have to imitate forest, because in your arms ...
Have they had a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more than so many.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Isn't it?
So, I tried to plant them, variating, there I have the aaiu, the cup, graviola, Andiróba, Copaiba, with Maru.
Now love it.
And everything there can't be a plague, (English) "Light, how?"
There everything natural, at EBRAPA, I saw there was a lot of poison, a lot of toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And fruit aside without comparison to ours.
In our community, we worked all with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural.
There's no tox in our community.
I?
To accompany human beings as an animal.
The child, I compared it and, as I only paid for it.
You talk, she's there listening, and then passing on to other children.
Popaguai was watching this attention, then he talked about animal quote, so I compared the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection, the most caught by those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the army, "My father says this: the first lesson we have to pass by has to come from our home."
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person who observes my house.
I kept observing my house and ... Audience: She kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, that's all right there.
So, I saw all this with my work that was going to do with children, who is the future?
And it's to work out.
And today we have ...
A job in the corner is far from the atom.
"When I'm going to take?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom?
It's the turtle of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river that had a hooligan before.
In front of us, it's a little like that of our community.
And ...
This hooligan, she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I get back to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... we breathe a pure air there.
So, I, my experience in the forest ...
Is it always being talking to people teaching children?
And ...
And I'm passing with other people, and I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small.
That I'm like that.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and approach us.
Let's talk about it, how do we bring people into practice?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
(Laughter) I'm like this: if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
People, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you very much, guys.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Giving these children is very proud.
In my family, and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream, to create this family.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasida melody and a seed layer.
And this puts the life of risk.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
Choose us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep searching for an optical melody, to think.
For him, to be able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured.
Then it was very incredible because all the school's most friends and all of us did a very big movement, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people, blood, and an incredible air.
It gave us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
(Applause)
The first message.
It was that when a child has leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest problems, fears, concerns, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and that's why we learned this lesson and spread it to our friends, to the school's more, to society, Facebook people, talking about it, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
What matters more or more important in life, the fight for life and for love?
People saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this is what gives the strength, or a living father, or a divorced warrior mother, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father, or a more divorced life, that will save my son's life.
(Laughter) And the third very important message that Trankède passed us with this disease to the world, "What?"
My blood, my hatred oil, we started to make them: our factory.
So, this raised awareness, so we have the capacity to donate blood so it needs and know it's not just a human being able to donate to another human.
For someone with blood cancer, blood is needed in the chests, when we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is processing and need it.
And donate "sedula ossea," castrate as a donor of "medula ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a donor and a patient, I, when it comes to the three of life, can you save in life, you can be a hero, one out of 100,000 people, so, if you can save in life, it's as if you were winning the mega-senha?
Oh, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be able to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life, without me, more strength, without any animator, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life.
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate módulos to save lives and be superheroes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
It's called Laikon.
You looked at it.
The base is like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Talola El Chinão.
Her Syrian was born in Damasco.
It's the capital of Syria.
In January, I studied at Damasco University.
Today, I'm a refugee, not Brazil with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little ...
(Laughter) Well, this is French.
I saw excuses, without a few moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Broancetto," which exerces Slam.
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with Islam.
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila, cheap and easy to live.
The population was over 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew since I was a child.
Three clothes stores: an office, engineering, two apartments.
I, a car in Damasca, and I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15, 2011.
Later, he came to all the other cities in the country.
My masco city was the safer of Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
Good, in five years of war, men and the country are destroying.
People: whom I know him were forced to carry on, or their children's left.
They found their injured smooths mutilated by a bomb, family members, disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have lost everything, they're dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we bars and our lives remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
To broadcast, my family, I went to Bahirute.
After ten months about Brazil having opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk to the Brazilian ambassad and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why had more opportunities?
And the Tevia Pinas, or a week, to leave brains.
Fifty years of my life.
It's starting again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my Brazilian family, Sara, with a lot of today, I have a Brazilian daughter, Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, my children's birthday, and they all said very well, the food my good friends talked about, I enjoyed it was the kitchen very well.
And making food to sell, that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has pen and paper ... (Applause) (Cheers)
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
(Laughter)
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed bright.
Etress, because of war and terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, or a journalist tells me, "I, after this happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk or talk, or contact with a person, a submano."
A lot!
Oislam likes blood.
It allowed us to kill in the name of religion, but exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
But also Branus, the Syrian, who is suggesting Islam's image, a basic religion, or Alcurão, not only sacred book since a person killed, without killing another, or without killing a terrorist organization about their life, Bescola, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even like the differences of culture and religion.
When those of your "yes," a woman using "hijabi," that handkerchief that covered hair, just like my wife, ask questions like, "Why do you use this leaf at home too?"
Alin TG Jabi, today, read other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, and kiss, ex-usted from the wedding test, some people told me, but I've already seen some humans who do all this.
See that Taoislam has these rules, but from each person wants to buy it, or not, the debt will forbade some things, to be the same way that they don't obey everything.
It's not good to have mexed as a battle of cake into alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
What was this sex?
Like more than a partner.
This is not happening practically.
(Laughter) Why are these things made of Islam?
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing Moislam, after the Exibic Agency, people always understand and respect.
Profect Muhammadez, that we must respect all religions, that everyone has the same value.
That we should be true with all of us.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black, or Indians, or that we should help those who need it.
Every year we have Alsaacá and we give two dots five by five.
All of our money for the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if the poor are Christian or Jewish Muslims.
(Video) And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows better or Islam.
To finish with the precocent, like this, my children.
And your children?
Balbuder to grow together based on the cellulary.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, I've come to recite my tears, in the Sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the roles of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe it, soon I lose hope, but in the daily bucket I know who suffers: "Geee, I eat," my salary ends, just like this race, I study the girl, it was what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand a service opportunity, there were a lot.
Cozinheira.
Faxineira, why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand this, you get me so much to pay a Secretary course, but not even inside the office?
I'm sorry, I made a mistake among you to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation: Deo, ME, ICT, be a maid.
If it was for option, I have several friends who are in this situation and conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, "Please, lunch gave me an opportunity."
And the teacher told me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, enter that little side that the vessor is waiting, welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011 and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, "Today, I came to talk about the success of the page "I'm a maid."
The page I created on Facebook, the page came up in July 2016 and, as I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was on a vacation house on Facebook.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life, and I got up there in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me, and, remembering all I achieved, also came some memories of when I was a maid for seven years.
And then I warned Galeironia, guys, I came to the memory of returning this on Facebook, and I'll use the hashtag and the maid, for my surprise, in less than 24 hours, that went viral very fast.
Soon after that, I put my first story, my first story on the internet, I had to bring the container, I couldn't use the cup in her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house -
There was a bathroom for houses, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I shared this first story on the internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, than everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot when I started talking about these stories, because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestications are more valued, they earn for an hour, so completely different here in our country.
which gives employment announces that I've tried as abuses, for example, an advertisement I read.
It was for workers and work in a second, nurture.
At 8 am, at 18 am, they earned 380 Brazilian reais.
One day, a week, much less, a month, 380 Brazilian reais per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions, today, there are domestications being prevented from feeding and they also don't earn food, there are domestications.
I couldn't use the bathroom and suffer all these atrocities.
And then I was very excited to experience so many books, and I started doing paper, it became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, rubbed all the quickly, I left half an hour to clean the books I wanted, and soon when I got home.
(Laughter) And there it's sitting down, delicizing me with those books, and, to my surprise, Regina gets into the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing the experiences I'd been through in the past, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts, and I saw there was a book and Isaça... (Laughter) And then I was very nervous, she said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Wow, I started reading in the university too."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and several class friends, who helped me, I summarized some texts, I try to get into the classroom to do the test, which is very difficult to concern.
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the typical Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
It's here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother ...
It was a maid.
My mother was a maid, and I was also a maid, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a maid, she started to cry.
Because I couldn't understand, but she already knew that everything she had spent while working in the family houses here in Brazil as well.
I would also pass.
Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview.
I took a suspicion, this after graduation, took a suspense, to see my experiences, to have established that, that and so on.
What about you?
Yes, or I'm magical ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say that what the big house was in the past ...
These are luxury apartments today.
It was the domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past without a distant past, it's very low to us.
They are the housemaid today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
Audience: Yes.
She came running, swallowed, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door." He told me, my boss came.
And when I get there...
I was already with the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, so she arrives and says, "Men, it was so stressed, we forgot to take her money, atyptian Monday, the modern senior is the maid's money."
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding, but, as I'm a happy thing.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little load of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss will work, he will work, he takes his wife to work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
At home, to hide me, and the only solution I had was to take copies from all rooms.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
AC: If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I'm blank, and so I can run away from him.
Because when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menine, stay, you make 18,000 a month."
You will never gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting, because I left my children a Northeast, and they need this money, because modern snake ...
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service.
I brought my little soil because my soil's pot is my peak, and then I was there, on this line of service, tamped, I picked my saving pot and made it in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the grabbing pot and use the bathroom, what's happening, not the bathroom can use the bathroom, and there wasn't the employee bathroom so I brought the pot?"
Why modern age?
It's the maid's petitd.
Today I'm here.
Because, when I told my boss that I hire the statistics, to some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because, when I told me, I wanted to study, you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for your family to serve."
So, you have to be happy, be coming, so I'm here, telling you the statistics: black woman, fat woman ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)
Beautiful woman, fat.
Professor.
Peripherical and Heck.
Open your side!
I'm not doing here today.
Behind me, there are 6 million houses.
(Laughter) That it should be next to me.
And that at some point they will be, what I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just to see that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch, because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone here must have several patterns, many patterns, and some domestic ones, if each of us takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships.
We'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries various domestications work and study, and here this domestic work has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, it's a uniform to be able to identify it, so I'm talking about six million households.
(Applause)
They're from African foundings and not mandated.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) (Music)
(Applause)
I'm here today to talk to you.
Especially.
Silence.
And it's already a bit funny to come out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
In the first time of my talk, to disconnect.
They connect their cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because it's about dying and fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silencing for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Who says that silence is a door to who we are emotionally?
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Fluxism."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
Open the agenda.
Take your eye.
It's insecurity, it puts equipment, etc.
I place inflammation points.
The first step ofuriation.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos.
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
That feeling, from that moment of presence ...
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
The human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
There are no beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Much less.
It was a lot of anger.
This is not in body.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now it's little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his eyes.
Several of you ...
Did you think?
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
You listen to me.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this space.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
(Exhaling) Put them on the floor, (Exhales) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags on the floor.
(Audience) Yes.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
Those with the laptops closed them.
And you who were noticing in notebooks, closing your notebooks for a moment.
with everything closed.
You are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look at me, look back.
Look.
For the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"No, I'll look at it like this."
You're good, you got even a little kiss... (Laughter) Audience: "Well."
He was connected, guys.
Look, folks!
Do you see where they are?
Do you see?
Do you see?
(Exhaling) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Very closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Until this moment is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TETO?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
The strong sense of direction exists a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and leaving the localization system connected?
Feel where you are.
Feel the chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
It's strange.
"No."
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality is new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence?
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become ...
A habit in our lives?
These are self-awareness technologies.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them.
Are you available?
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Get more generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
The direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another autensity, silence is a source of freedom.
The TEDxT.
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video, (Laughter) which is usually the first view.
How was my case?
I can say it's an absolutely hard competition.
The walls are so serversive that the idea of translated from a demand of a region of fans and ideas.
who asked other fashion exits shared with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In Brazil, the translation work is fundamental, once only 5% of people agree with the Turchical apartment of the sun.
And, above all, they have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
translating to 116 languages.
And, almost always well in 6,000 translations made up until now.
But we are only translated, as we also transcribe the talks made in events, like these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world.
But it's clear to allow people a hearing impairment.
They can follow the content of the talks.
(Laughter) When the talk isn't given in English, my case wanted to read in Portuguese, first it is transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified for me, instead, and from English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
Initially, TEDx with its own prototype says, "The bond only as TED technology, entertainment, which is "e," we can translate as a funnel.
And I thought about the stage to refer to it.
Currently, the talks lead to a inferiority of subjects that go from excellent issues on political entertainment, businesses, entrepreneurship.
and even literature.
We have, for example.
At the end, they go back to chance hours.
Another one of my passions.
Finding what follows the topic is this auditory event.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
It's to translate and notice as an eye.
Think about the TEDx environment.
And they can be the "terrox" for these TEDx stones, or TVs are seen as curte educational, accessible to have children.
Very small.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a strict word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," but to be "trox" is inside.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember the translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my society, because I'm quite anxious.
It doesn't just want to be a winner.
Sometimes, if I say I'm going to translate only, but half an hour and hours per radiation, two or three hours went by, and this happens with me in counter-founders.
Audience: Yes!
Not only because I had fantastic people, but I'm getting to know at this event.
inspiring people.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive excedent.
(Portuguese) In initiatives like this: "That's TED."
(Applause)
(Applause) Second dangerous: Eddy Frome.
It opened itself the option of a man in life.
Audience: Yes.
It gives light to oneself and become what is essentially, that I have no doubts about education.
It's fundamental for that.
I also have no doubt that education is fundamental for people less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society.
They can insert themselves in a dignity way in our society.
And when I ask for volunteer work, I think it's the donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge.
Can you help an object?
Just because his volunteer work gets my choice, my decision.
I have to do the best way possible.
And try to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces, the remains of our time.
The tradition and complex activity that takes not only to know the same foreign woman, the fingerprint, but mainly.
Our language.
And Men Fongos, who is a young destiny, because of a successful translation, there's always a huge knowledge.
Many research, a lot of work, many hours of dedication.
And for us, a fluent translation to be ours of kiss, there's always a shadow that I'm distressed.
And frustrated with what?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved almost indeterminently.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations, not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who will watch, OK?
And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transitions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally took advantage of a cordiner's motto or a language coordinator.
Or, as we call it, "How about yourself?"
In Brazil's case of Brazilian Portuguese, Juncia O Portuguese in Portugal, which is very different.
We have ten elites, which I would like to cite here nominations.
I read stories, we have Helena, we have Maricene.
Claudia?
What about me?
I use our guys.
And that's why, in my left, Gustavo.
Antônio O Gosódio and Rafael.
(Sigh)
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
Very well ... (Laughter) This obsession I have with education?
In fact, it has to do, not only with Brazil.
who lives in a deep, political crisis, that education is used for the pan cycle, but without having my own personal history.
(Laughter) My father, who today was about two years old, if he was coming, mistreated primary school.
Nevertheless, he knew from that baby very well and had to do the four, looked for mathematics very well.
And their dream was to always be able to study language because I'm studied.
And to make our children study, that's why homosexual people who lived our neighbor in our home called "Taiobeiras."
He decided to change for his four kids at the time, I stop very strange, the biggest city than girls.
And, on some side, my father had sold his start, his Uberas shop, and his place.
They also knew, as a businessman, they had a small hotel from a presence store that had remained years.
However, in 1964, there was a great reession to Brazil, due to this reession, and other reasons, my father was the false and absolutely lost everything, he was literally nothing in his nine roles.
(Laughter) Many of them felt very humiliated from their economic practice, my father decided.
And after paying these damages?
According to Belo Horizonte, as it's a front or behind, eating well liked to seduce.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who is now old, is helping me, right?
Besides being a "aspeer" in Paráito Games, eyes for water.
She was an excedent cooker, a higher training course, my bicycle, and she decided to sell markets.
So, for many years, in my house, a pair of queijo was literally Caiopó, say that passing in the best queijo and pedalizing parents.
(Applause)
So although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up.
It's that we were had to study.
Audience: Yes.
And that's how it was done: a big done without a doubt, because I already run away from the score of national research by homicilious samples.
In the 48-year-old crossing, in Brazil's 60s?
Only 32% of people in solidarity greater than me, yes, to lament.
And this obsession, this step, this passion for my father comes to education.
Transparency?
In the smaller days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself.
standing up.
For seven years, at that time, we generated the alphabetization of seven chances.
And a provocator who think of a notebook and asked my newspaper, filled with a healing for him, and for any visibility that would come home.
(Laughter) So, I'm entering, switching through words, you can imagine.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalisites of Parkia," right?
But for my father, they would check their babies.
Without knowing, he was having a little time for this talk here.
I left.
My five siblings were able to give up, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children.
How many better dreams than we've had, right?
And here I say, to me, the greatest passion in my program's life, very much, are my two kilos: Daniel, and the young Henrique.
Which I never put it as the chair to see the newspaper for me?
But why did I question all the nights?
It tells stories before everything.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
As a coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, became teachers.
Education is to be a doubt on a being.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is a reeducator, without a protest, for me, fantastic, creative, integral, revolutionary, that applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we had to be homicide by education.
Despite the living conditions, despite developing our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx, just as my father was such a simple way, inspired us.
Just like today, it was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
TEDx inspires us.
It's to spread ideas.
They make us believe that, despite everything -
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with her taking our first contact with her armile, an alphabet where she can feel the things that are written.
AC: Throughout the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they stay how they worked, showed us the letters, numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it's super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up telling myself the alphabet, and I did many times.
And I left to buy a fill, which is a small one that allows you to describe in arms, in which you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda ...
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, it still gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, there wouldn't be thousands of processes like this, we'd get one on the Internet, and we'd be ready to connect with engines, and we'd have a clock.
But she saw there was no Internet before deciding what our own is.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and the minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines were shaking and nothing happened, but we reescribed everything, disconnected and reconnected everything and started to work. And, about a month ago, we ended the clock, and we showed it to us, and it encouraged us to continue this project, to try to create a smaller report or a translator in Braille, it was very moving.
Every process we went through knows a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
and use them so that they could change the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
I could help with sad inclusion and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my best you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and if even we, two high school students who haven't even finished it?
In high school, we are second to hurt, we are teenagers, we are able to create something innovative.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) (Music)
(Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask you a question.
What do you think?
There are agultive people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
(Applause) You can put your hand in the air.
Audience: Yes.
OK, we're all in the corner.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relations.
This is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance commercial relations.
It's a volunteer exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the objective of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women.
that manage their business autonomously, they publish their ads.
We received their clients.
In apartments, in hotels, or in street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about this that I've come to talk about and not about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
Obviously, it involves me 16 or adults who didn't give sense to their consent are cases of crime.
There are cases that must be chosen, criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, therefore, a storming prostitution and processed frustration.
It doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse this situation against sexual exploitation.
But to take all the people who do this situation through traffic victims for sexual action, is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were the whole.
Research has shown that Portugal the traffic phenomenon falls through sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but that can be crossed.
To give you an idea of what I just said, which Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and which, regarding the year of 2016, are the latest available data, indicates that in Portugal were confirmed 118 traffic victims.
Humanity.
Almost all of us for job exploitation, victims for sexual harassment.
Only three.
Of course, I was hearing a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There is an image in a very historical way of preservation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
Defense.
Sured.
And that you're waiting for someone to wrap well.
But does this also not answer to reality, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, we know that there is a diversity of buildings.
Here, the decision flourished.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they say is that this was an option.
A hidden option after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a despair and not recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think which image comes immediately to you?
(Laughter) The mind, when you think of a person that prostitates.
Think about it.
OK, and I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any other one.
Or, a woman with a bad looks and a minister who is in a corner, in a dark street in the city.
And that is very likely a dry touch of teeth and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor.
The reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
of practices?
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and life experiences.
They are not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Of someone on the street?
I say that the studies that are the distance of being done.
And the accidental cities.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
Complete or place.
Because it will only represent people around 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when do we think about women?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
They're minorities, but they're not neglected.
Let's give the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by Sonhadias, from the University of Lisboa.
And that interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context, as in the context of the inner, men, women, trans people.
And that, all over the country, found 10 victims 2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage is train more elevated, so, when the speech does.
On the victim of a man or opressor, you forget that it's a percentage of men who are.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the medicine.
And that ...
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not prohibited to sell sex.
But it's a crime to buy sex.
The idea that is at the bottom of this law.
It's that the people in the presentation are victims without exception, and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
(Laughter) But there are very strong evidences, namely non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse and indicate that this law puts a greater risk.
Speeders themselves put rich people for sex taste and that increases their vulnerability, violence.
It's the stigma and the disease.
Audience: Yes.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
(Laughter) They are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that, without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
For an idea that I think ideologically biased, even because research has proved that relationships between...
Five workers of sex and clients are complex relationships and that, mainly, we are abusive relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of cooking the customers is unfortunate.
They're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them are able to perform sex professionals.
There are even countries.
They have a fungal figure, a sexual assistant, who is someone who receives practice.
to know how to have sexual donations with people who are disabled disabled people.
I think this example is quite clear about social relevance of this work.
about the relevance of sexual work.
And now, the one who destroys any argument that tries to be the favor of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make it easy.
To their own, economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done yours.
It came across the work commissions.
If this can be done, without more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
It's such a strong scenario for people who do sex work, why are stigmas so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically morale?
Sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality considered legitimate.
It's normal.
And naturally, and Portugal we have a deaf sex is considered illegitimate.
Anormal, anti-natural, and that's when the beginning of sex is located.
And the fact that more than sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is based on stigmatization.
from the social rejection, the descentralization, health, and the devalorization of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a mark of "deep descent."
The stigma that rejects sex workers is strong, has many consequences: stigma dehumanizes stigma, is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex players.
Like, for example.
When he runs into institutions in the health area.
Even justice and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way, now, a little bit, that I don't know if someone used this word, not TEDxBas, the stigma of puta.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The worst offense we can drive a woman is to call her puta.
In other words, the stigma of women's life in two types, the honor and the honored ones, the serious and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of the head of any of us, any woman knows that, if there is a sexual behavior that is deserved, the norms that are described socially, there is the risk of being a puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
So, what do I think we can do any of us can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex damages?
And I think that the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge stigma.
But I'm here to make this moment and give voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time.
The sex avoidant.
So, everyone is organized and we use 70 but, precisely because of stigma, their voice is not true, they are not heard, they're not heard, we don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we who have rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural, that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Artic: "Be curate, art."
It was cured, being a doctor.
It was the idea supported by a fundamental letter.
In the patient's medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to spiritually engage, otherwise the way I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have there, father, empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment that, so I can propose.
The best treatment for that divism.
This balance is very delicate.
And the human relationship of our time, with all the most superficial and most rawest: "I'm in this balance, it's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors also went there.
Divers times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
Bantilular, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have since I had no childhood.
And to relate to someone who needed my knowledge to do and to be able to offer that engagement, that love.
This kind of service.
He's polite.
Bruji.
And this convention, the Indian and schedule request.
Honorai.
All the doctors who go with us and talk about it.
"Yes, Rouquis."
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice.
What did I say?
The simplification that occurs can be repeated here too.
It's the small grandmother she needs, and through the Amazon, I discovered this.
So, I traveled to myself and why did I find out?
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university before.
Have you done a list of topics for every student?
The first objective is:
Very well.
We're even good.
These same students at the end of the Medical Court.
With the same research?
But signs are success and knowledge.
It's madness.
When did we do it wrong?
If we got someone who had a poetic scope?
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry about the average relationship with the patient, with medicine, reigns the past.
In Greece, the weight of medicine, where the father of medicine is, who is poor.
It doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When Adão hacked with the apple, Eva desengascheoi, and that was to make a leg trip, that's what we do until today, it didn't touch the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and little your father in medicine because for the first time?
We must have a method there.
It can transform the art of healing something that can be taught, learned, retrodessed, replicated.
And in giving a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and created an isolation of pedocrimes.
And even today it's used in medicine formatures.
In the world, a 7th Cristo had been done.
It's a good thing, OK?
These are slightly complex words, and I prepared three partners here.
In all houses I entered, I just said to see the exercise of the patients.
Exiting all the volunteer and corruption damage, especially the sedution of women, men, children and surroundings.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
It's respecting this law and not violating it, it would be the dignity of equality and reputation between men in all times.
And if I bring the violin revolves, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, you worried about this, and you still do an training?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to be thrilled, because the prepacient medical relationship is impressible for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken with honor judgment.
And, in this case, I was honored to participate in a position that is registered to a judgment of waves.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of him.
One actor and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we'll specialize a lot, incurate this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in class in college, in class with small groups, like teachers.
And ...
I stayed with Spanish processes, patients with scraphy, resonance, microscopy and ultrasombe.
I'll look for their hand in their belly, so in their awareness house.
"Oh, I'm not less composing either."
She called me a bit, called my class and said, "Let's see the patient's belly."
He looked, had to hide with the patient's finger, who doubted what he was smoking and, inside, he didn't smoke anymore, hole from five and him, showed that he had emagreced.
Like these in your skin are smoothy, you can have fun.
And he's able to take care of his own clothes, a dirty god, he can say a lot, "The time when you're mexing for a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he has, he can remember something that doesn't teach us, and he said, "If all this doesn't convince us?"
Besides, as you're seeing patients.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move on it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to speak, not verbally for him that you are careful with him.
You're using the book, you want to do good, he's asking me, "Let's take care of you."
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, they improve faster and have a more precocently evil.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no amsterious change, no X-rays, no sees anything, there are illnesses that are symptoms.
As does it say, does it happen because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the relationship even the patient.
But to be a patient, a patient, and to be passive, to those who are talking about this to me.
Anyone you'll tell this to a group of mind because, after all, the active act of the relationship are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two habits.
Here in months, in the patients' counts.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive and passive, and we have to hold our hands, and it's in our cure process.
And it's not only going to look for healthy life, but also to engage in the process of healing, in decisions for the healing process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
Where are we talking about Dr. Google, who is fashionable, is not fashionable, when I was a child, had many copies of the size in my house, medicine and health?
There was a book, a health book, and that always existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor - you had to have content to talk.
Nowadays, with Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them are very good and very important, but many, very bad.
And we need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information, it's greater than the filtrate capacity.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see the information first.
Information, today, usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but you don't even who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people enter there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they know it doesn't have me for anything, this because it puts me, because just like other people who are defending personal interests, gain, live "medio" or other things.
So, signature, the second very important thing, don't believe in good and conventional things, look, medicine changed, now their problems have finished.
It's usually a bobbing.
Differently a lab with a scientist will have a disturbing and immediate discovery without society identifying itself.
It's not killing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one is on its own, so there's nothing you discovered today, tomorrow it's on the Internet and my doctor, when I don't know: trouble.
The third: if there's a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
You are based on who dominates information.
It's hardly some other interest and exclusion behind, so these things of my partner was the president of my hand.
For a long time.
Any information, discuss to your doctor, it's there for that.
Inform in the midst of knowledge, information and information is knowledge.
Take the information, participate in their cure, but spread their doctor.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura.
Yes.
Ask, demand, know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, in a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years in October."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of...
To exist, not to get there fighting with everyone in the people's teacher, isn't that, right?
Really, knowing.
To exist: if we compose with our chest, we go.
To make atendments different.
Doctors want that.
They want the right loss.
They don't want to have this attempt, or their names at the time, they want to take care of the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in Venezuela, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, the area was mom.
And we had a patient there, he had sneakers cancer.
It's a lobo.
Thank you very much.
And there was no orologist with us, and we brought to São Paulo, which is being treated here in the future of cancer.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation.
It was an eye because he didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor obviously didn't speak well in the human.
He had a translator, his son, his neighbor, who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was obviously furniture.
And I made a consultation.
And, for me, you'd give us a scene from a movie.
The index looked at the doctor.
Isn't it?
Fear was.
Why?
Very well.
(Laughter)
When I'm trying to tell you why, at that moment, magic happened.
Have you been debated?
Without stretching the language without having a completely different culture than the other.
He handed his soul, that other individual, and had all the interest in taking care of him.
This magic?
It's the art of a short manner.
There's no need to tell a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors working on prosecutors, in ambulants, and in office, who have.
So, anonics want.
Doing.
Taking love for the fight.
Excuse me, paying attention.
So?
We, doctors.
I have to try to find it.
Another unity is our treatment.
More compassion.
Every partners.
The active pleasure in your cure process.
This makes me have a connection.
Tell the world, there's better, and you'll be more invented because of this.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thirty and five thousand, when I talk about this experiment, I think that for this group of people, most people chose to make a decision, that is, they've achieved at least well in the occasion, the second group, the result of this experiment that we see in a different way, that people chose a digital option, and the person chose a digital option, and also, and that made me a lot about this, because I have two options in the middle, there are two options in the middle, to influence an action of the middle, because I have two options in the middle and the middle of the world, and we want the idea that we have in a different way, and we want the idea that we're in a different way, and we want the idea that we're in a digital way, and we want to see that we're in a different way, and we want to see that we want us to see that we can see that we have an idea
