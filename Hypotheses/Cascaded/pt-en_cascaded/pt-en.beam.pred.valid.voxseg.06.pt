I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What this said is that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox: our children are what we have of most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and, however, our children come from maltratted to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
What if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, who are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
And if they rebel, we offer them prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
Gabriela's mother wants a natural birth, in that moment of a link, of affection with her daughter, to receive, along with her husband, that baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal birth, and very quickly the hospital medicine industry, a typical middle class child who produces the culture of cesaly, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible.
According to 15 to 20% of the countries involved, this generates huge benefits for children. This makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical acute, with a woman is donated, imobilized, of course, she can be humanized and can be well done, but certainly won't have the same benefits with a normal impact.
And remembering that, of course, there are necessary cablets for each of these sines that we'll write.
And we are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working, will tell the reality, "Here, you can take a breast is a little milk formula, a grandma's case, she goes home more safe, she goes to her grandma's house, her mother, that business you, is alive, is outside.
The child is crying, the tolerator is thin, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a large part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: prize, ex-person.
Suprim, and breast milk is money, it's for, it's breastfeeding, but it just comes with a lot of love, and it's infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, making a doctor their marriage, convinced of their nutritional qualities, withgressions, and sponsoring the medical society, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatrist, who end up unconsciously being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil.
The privileges of breastfeeding and searching through the first sin, which is the privation of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
And my Gabriela grows, her mother will finish license, she will have to go to the bucket, because vovement can't take care of it.
And she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, but to get home, her parents are tired of tiredness during a long work day, of rolled up, and they'll live little with her daughter, and they'll take babies because, after all, when no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what's most precious in childhood, unlikely to our children, we often regret their adolescence, and the child loses the relief to the most important people of their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of this terrible peculiar of childhood's personalization.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food in fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar excess.
Crossing abroad, all the weapons that the industry, through highly developed food engineering, makes children completely addicted to industrialized food, and in this unable way to eat healthy food, they can't, because they are cats.
This brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity that we're producing in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, because it comes in a database of agrotoxis, we are world consumption champions.
This is the sin inxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and someone knows that highly negative from the involved of a child.
It has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run, hide, go out, and, however, our urban life doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, to stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they enlighten me, and don't want everyone to get in touch.
So these children spend eight, guys, being a statistic.
And 8 to 10 hours connected with their devices today, again, connecting with the wall game, it's great, but not eight hours later, children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
We looked at Janela, and saw a landscape passing in the form of meditation. However, today, two babies and two states for each one, if we can't give something in the car, even in moments, this exists, people.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child needs the most - this exists, it comes from there, but you can say, "Ipórico," "Ipote."
This is the name, IPOR, which still comes with a layer to cover the tablet, if you don't look for an audience, even in moments when it needs the most consciousness, that's what we offer to her, in awareness, the absurd and compulsive distraction, and prevent them to have a moment of awareness, of void, of TED, of TED, of TED, of TED, fundamental, in childhood, with confinement and permanent distraction.
I opened her, watched four hours of television per day, she's massacrated by advertising, she's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it spend at maximum four hours, and she spend more time on television, in the Americans, and we have less time in school.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, not to the park, and the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family today comes week, which is "O".
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, by consumerism values, and this advertising is a cubed obesity, it is an obesity that explodes its ability, to distinguish, to fantasy reality, that fell in love with values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
And in obesity, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, it's not people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind it, it's obviously the one who needs most friendship are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by child consumerism.
Gabriela fica with the agenda full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises, to relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate on the little square, people on the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who has no meditation in the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." There is no better meditation than that!
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: "Merodization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, merosation, which is based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating eroodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we're eight, ten years old, this peculiar of the ending in childhood and eroticization to which?
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put her on trono, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she goes wrong in school, the school's guilt, you see the present.
And she realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, that realizes that their parents don't have authority, and we need people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms, and we are doing what the Americans call "Helécópopinting."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world, making them not have life experience, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration with pain, with difficulty, and the world will certainly deliver them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the very easy super-power: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, birty, and will get sick, eat too much, it'll be obese, it's going bad at school, it doesn't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way.
The same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What's the solution we're not going to give to evilted children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, it's called "medicalization and the worst iny."
The quino de Mafalda says this: "Franced in a wonderful way, telling the stories of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people going badly because of children, not only with alliate children, the adults also in a way to be shameful.
The medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today, you can see that in the United States, 15% of children today are so mounted as black, this individualistic society.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, just like medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and imperativity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
And this isn't a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood, we're rotating, "normatizing," and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, we'd have lost that wonderful thing that brought us.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but for all problems, complex problems of humanity, as a philosopher said, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
What we think about this: a well-established TEDx solution, I'm already going through and going to spend my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today means a discomfort payment in almost all churches, the "décima" is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, which are our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays?
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40, a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing, and if it doesn't happen in the weekends, we start with one at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fourteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow, because they have health, quality of life, a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
JP: No?
I'm sure it's the greatest one of you.
And this demonstrates a little the importance of nature, nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul, we know what makes us healthy, not a doctor, hospital, medicine. These factors are all of us, we know this, what we don't know and had an interesting experience.
I started with Patricia, who back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible?"
I talked about convergence, health and sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment, everything that does well the environment and vice versa: riding a bike, makes the body good, my cities, pollution, collective transport, makes good for the time of relief, reductive.
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness especially for children, who will get to know each other and learn how to deal with them, we'll develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physicist, mental, and then reduce all childhood problems.
Soccupying public spaces, games, love, affection, and involvement, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly that.
And not only the initiative to use physics, it has been seen, reinvinating for this reason that public policies, that facilitate us with public space with nature, that promote bikes.
Free events, these steps: neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocupaque" used earlier for resistance and citizens, and mainly it means to take public space with joy, because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas related to public interest, sustainability, and equity.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, that's coming here, will come very early: our children will pick me up, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, that there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to the relief, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold caching, not seeing YouTube, we learn more about this box, and they will defend in the future, because we only defend what we're doing, so, in summary, this is our proposal, let's take public spaces, with play, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I refuse to show a phase of the gallery side that left us that year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is on the horizon.
And the more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so why does the utopia do not make us walk?
What does it make us walk outside.
AC: In 2007.
AC: I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disabilities, excluded from regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
AC: To be able to discuss inclusion within school, with parents.
With their children and their partners.
AC: People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
Pommunity.
It's for society in general.
People with disabilities -
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
I don't have friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
VR: To have friendship.
We need to interact with people.
I count the case of the student Igor, for example, that in the other school he studied.
AC: For four years he didn't go into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't have the strength either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education and, as he loved to run, he kept running all the time.
When I got to the Seja Campulimpo, I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
What for him to do?
They improved the best learning.
The school?
For me, it was a place.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
And today he's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And you can teach the student to heal.
The learning process itself.
The schools think.
They are not able to assist these students and they are not prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use them.
And I believed.
(Laughter) What are they capable and that these quitments inside the school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do well to other students.
For the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
AC: Why is school like that?
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see it.
And I learn.
You can know.
My hearing is living with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs.
With those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
AC: It's learning the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you: when I was a kid, I loved seeing my grandma cooking, right?
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Paáscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that, until today, she asked me, "How, and why did I go to the kitchen, and that's the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking?"
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies, that could use food as a prevention, cure and treatment of diseases as a form of medicine.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we are.
I built the food system through food, and I believe...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
It's the detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Trossé is a little from the rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way that we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
With this, we see.
It's able to reestructure the food system, change the dynamic of food.
The production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces, the cheaper it produces.
Even worse is quality, and the animal cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, it is artificially accelerated, and it loses its quality of life, its health, and its life time.
So I believe we can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilogram, I said, "Guys, how can it be, this didn't enter my head."
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very... each Brazilian consumes around 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
I wanted to understand why, but the answer is because our current society.
There are inverted values, there's an investment of values, because a person worries about not buying a failed perfume, because they think they'll have an allergic reaction, because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what chemistry there is inside.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
And why is that?
So I wanted to understand and discover what this change of values is, and we need to teach people.
to appreciate organic products, because when you buy a pack of leface, a pack of organic leface, you're paying not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of you, with all affection, and took this interface to you, so we invested in your health, and we respect nature.
(Laughter) That's why I...
I think that, efficiently, I fell in love with cooking and nutrition in terms of distribution, it's also not a third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
And in terms of consumption, the way we consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in São Paulo.
And if I took her, I put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue.
I'm sure that it's to be very scared, seeing those executives or those appreciated people, walking down the street, speaking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because it's something that people think is a waste of time, but it's also very important to feed.
And it's ...
And then?
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for that, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we end up opening space to the street, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo-duriaçúcar," which are the three, that is, industrialized products, in excess, are very harmful, and they end up destroying our palm, but a physical dependence, but also a mental dependency, a physiological dependency, it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
Who here is still a cake, instead of buying that little package little pack, o... Metade half... And who here still makes a pick of bread, a pack of bread in the place of microwonds, look... Metade half... (Laughter) Who here makes a cake?
This question may seem like these two questions, may seem a little harmless, not to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange your microwaves' popcorns, or a packaging this could be a trash less in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrialized products is very harmful to it.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think this food dynamic is a lot, this food system isn't healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
cooking brings independence, brings self-awareness, brings autonomy, brings freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
And I hope it's not an industry.
It's because they don't cook, they simply process food, so if you let the industry feed you?
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, chicken dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we are ...
(Applause)
Keep rice and bean... Imagine the rice and bean, guy ... There are many people who don't care, there's no appreciation in the kitchen, you must think that cooking is a bean.
And letting it frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a street, fresh that you do in 20 to 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
To wait or twice as Pizza.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: men, women.
There is no age, no sex, girl, child, adult, boy, elderly, sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, by changing education, we teach children, taking their children to fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think that it comes from the supermarket shelves, so we're from good children.
I believe that we have to change the dynamic of food, we have to value food more, value the act, growing with fear of a wedding food, healthy food, eating.
And cooking, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to license, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Right?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
There are fewer hospitals, this is education, education, prevention, so?
The future of food.
And it will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better.
(Applause) Thank you.
Life is not here for us to live.
AC: But is it that we wake up?
And how is the crown to tell?
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family is to be here, I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to the family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my old grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world, happened yesterday, but, at 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are and when we contain them, we transform ourselves, and those listening also transforms, before looking at this future, we need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "discamids," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened, this book helped me to live the mourning, so I had used it and told this story brings one of the most beautiful things about it.
That is the power that people can, when they feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously someone will help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had already been very small to me.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx about purposeful entrepreneurship, something so fashionable nowadays, but he brought me another challenge.
That was talking about bullying, because that's what he'd always suffered, and he wanted to share the story with the others, and I left because I had to do with the theme, but I had water.
(Laughter) While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of badness and always had a lot of complaint with the right.
Above all that had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can take responsibility of who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who was understanding this, was changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about acceptance and family.
It was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, I've also seen that the roof they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat.
(Laughter) And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed, and just as he welcomed, I'll tell him a lot of people's story.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that didn't feel embarrassed. Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story to tell him that they had felt welcomed in his story, who wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families, then tell me stories.
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we're ready to hear, we transform ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years, training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about asking a question to the audience, tells something funny, shows your children's picture, but, in fact, I think this isn't the most important thing, and if there's no formula, there's a big rule for me.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage, and it's not the roof that courage has a heart.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, ávio, the professor of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we spent months preparing his speech at the Açador's TEDx.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
One day, two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this."
Every time you tell me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to get out of here, you have to be your heart, and it has changed everything.
He came at the day, and he gave an incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how it was the fact that he had been heard, when he needed it, when he thought about "suicide," when he had cancer.
Because he tells me, and we're afraid to change ourselves, we're afraid to change, although the most spoken word here, is that we're going to change, we transform ourselves, and that's what taught me that when we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell, we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and how knowledge we always get there and say.
I won't even listen to ourselves and to others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to come to embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time for people.
Because we're worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
AC: This, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
AC: But.
MA: And empathy?
(Laughter) There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the variest stories I heard.
It holds out all the others.
(Laughter) Because empathy too, I learned collectivity, when she taught me that we need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when they ask for something, we have yes, we have at least one smile, and it doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
AS: What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my gut -- (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, why do you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?
To show her the key of her lives, the room of flaws, the salles of values, the kitchen of uncertainty, I wanted to free many of the people I know, and for all, came from a poem I wrote myself, and now you apologize me, but I'll read, I want to free many of the people I know, to give them the faith in life.
Liberating fear, I wanted many people I met to have, at least, one minute of rest, so they could look at their side and smile again, tell and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, or you may say there are judgments, where there are all sorts of stars, and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they are only belonging to their plurial spaces, there isn't the lake, the homagra, beautiful, rich, poor, and they're only legacted to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, from the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
That's exactly why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky, the universe was infinite, no one was broken or the beauty of the other.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and definitely understand that the different one agrees?
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
And this is rich, this exchange, so I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to learn something different from us. We learn new stories, new narratives, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from you, allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in that process the bathroom, for me, was a doll ball, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God, the why I was different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
But the question is: what was in the bathroom that didn't have in the other places and that was denied to me, or better, why did I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom and answer is simple, that I'm different?
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society was something bad, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see girls transicioning friends, and that desire to grow up inside me, blind, I want to turn into mistakes too, like this, I researched on the Internet, but I didn't see people like me, so when it's about the trans universe, I learned to mirror myself in the other, because of lack of information, and, I started to mirror myself in the other.
It's because of this process, it has painful phases and not everybody is standing to deal. It's difficult when you're in the middle of a mixture of transformations, and you still have to learn to deal with the not acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world, in case of us, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They get bothered by their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come here, do you go after yourself, our new thing, there's no crossing faces, no, you're staying, you're going to pass?"
AC: People.
Who are aware, chooses, who is the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's a magnifying glass here who wants to see this one.
While men exist, they have their life expectancy of 76.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
And I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 144 people who were killed here in Brazil, in 2016, some 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even 9 times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence, being trans, in an option, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of pre-established ideas about me, after I finally found who I was, after I finally found who I was, I was invited to live a trans character, I saw myself being a model, layer of J-T magazine and "perform" and "outube," and in "Apstem-Car" for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's a responsibility, bro!
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
That's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
Even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they'd say, "They've been filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, and there's no price."
There's no price to receive message from mothers from other girls who thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
Or better, receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shining, thank me for seeing me there and seeing yourselves, "This has no price."
To understand the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be just the strange.
His transsexual only has to go in the part of what I am.
I'm far beyond that, I'm much beyond strange.
But to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference agrees.
The sky is the refuge of allies.
Who was me, one will be there.
A lot of blue, freedom without limits: me and sky, sky and me.
I've already took away from my courant, no longer looking, I don't play to stop, only what's left of their scars.
But the future, what the future promises, which brings with my soul, is what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I'll fly, fly and everything.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get out of tumors and we won't get a sixth grade."
(Laughter) Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
(Laughter) I got courage, I had never been hospitalized, given point nothing, and it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and I didn't, in the same yesterday I stayed with the children with cancer, and I asked my parents to call me, and she said, "It's out of the visibility."
(Laughter) So I asked her to give me her hand.
Until I slept, I cut only after the room.
I used to travel with cancer, measures and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because, after all, I'll do it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter) So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was safe in that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
What sometimes didn't help, which didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "canscer."
And I was stubborn.
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, piruque was for them, that it wasn't able to see me as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital, a blunt, I asked you, "No, now I've got you all the same, I've got cancer, the children said, "Wow, you cut your hair off to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer, don't take it."
But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a glass and a toothpaste brush, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
This for my information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through that, and what happened, the children started to give me their procedures."
(Laughter) So they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We started playing, but we thought chemotherapy caused hair falls, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair fell down," as well as hair cells, they would still understand, "Oh, it's working!
And he started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to add a catheter, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running," and then I said, "There is a patient who will breastfeed a leg," "You can come here," and he's in the middle, but we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write the love with your heart, you drawings, ventricles.
I think it's good, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide, this guide is to distribute for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year if there's a sponsor in the audience.
(Laughter) For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
With that, we started to dismistify and engage on what happened: hospitals started to use, children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and the guide requests in Northwest, because children and parents, many times, are alphabets that children will do.
and do several other actions.
The information is very important, and sometimes information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, complex modernity, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent in a kit, so what we talk and we prepare.
That you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when you do events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done the treatment, he's with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, he's in spreading care, or there's no thing at the moment.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, but you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't have.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient, how many times I was in the hospital, in the room, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problems at home, will I still go to this internship, I want to take them to the hospital to see what's a difficulty?"
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need help, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today, all I can do is information so we can save many others. Thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because the dependency here gives me a disease in a brain disease and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Laughter) What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought about various things, and one of these things is in our own organism: one of these defense is in our brain, it's called packaging packaging barrier, despite being a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and brain veins and that make bacteria that viruses and non-violent substances don't enter the brain, don't let us down.
Unfortunately, drugs manage to contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the sterfallic barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
AR: We also have another protection system which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by anticorpos cells and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances too, in this video, you can see the macrophobe and neutralize it.
So, could we not gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are us?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs quantities, producing anticope against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
It's enough.
AC: You don't need more drugs in the system, you're overcrowded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barrière to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system, a message of hope.
(Laughter) In other words, an immune system for two anticorns against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-crophs are big molecules, and then that problem that the emerencephalic barrier had to let go straight away the drugs stop existing, because when the user ...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is connected to a large and pum molecule, it's no longer in the kitchen barrier, you speak.
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is, OK?
Here, the right of you?
We have a while that hasn't received the vaccine, these white dots you can see, it's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
(Laughter) When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals, once we were able to imunize them, and you can see on the left side, there is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which shows that probably this cocaine that passed by.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, they're arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency, so what our group is working now is, in fact, to help people to really win.
Maybe, in a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time to decide a time to gain freedom again and discuss with themselves if they want to use drugs, thank you very much.
That's it!
I'm being.
A psychotherapist.
More than 40 years ago.
And I want to read and say that -
Besides.
VR: Daneroses.
Audience: Yes.
Narrator: Malen?
Psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infelelelelelled, "Dad, go?
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
Great meeting of this TEDx.
In Sapura.
It's here.
No, music is being.
It was stunned from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus?
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example, is an example perhaps.
The most deadly.
What is "aluar moço"?
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important part of the norm is the context.
Sistenio.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
It won't always exist, girlfriend is a typical disease.
At times.
I said, "What? What?"
And we live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, not of corruption predomina.
Dehumanity, in its word, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
Is it a worker?
It's been more than 30 years since.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is the absence of conflicts.
And I said, "No.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes a bit of payment.
What military for peace?
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Sintomas with you?
Sometimes even.
A despair, conscious, light.
Is it an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
From a family shell, when my daughter Isabela was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What is the princess you like most?"
Gataweira, Cinderela?
The fallen asleep?
She thought.
And he answered.
And I like all the maid's writing.
And I too.
And I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling.
In your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is it a fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests.
And being deertified, these people would dismay.
My respect is the world.
People known as psychiatrists and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
People considered crazy, are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
Sistendic, and sometimes I fail.
And how did I say it?
What's crazy?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And don't talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call "siquatic," are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here, from Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
What am I wanting for you?
Why we love it?
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
That nothing against certainty?
At that moment, "Hi!
That you suffer a desire too.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo, racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
Namorphosis!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The girlfriend of another specialization, a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
No, no.
And the thorta sky catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mime, mimore, and it doesn't realize, its existence in the sense, we're going.
In an inexorable globalization, a person who is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
And to appeal the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It's a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
Apontating.
As it's a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The wish that brought us the incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage.
It's because we're honoring a promise we made.
And we live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can tell if you didn't tell her to lose.
"So? What do you mean?
In the foundation of norms?
[A.DE.]
Or situations.
There's another one.
This is very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said or not.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird from a snake, from a box?
I ask a friend, "Wow, there's a space."
Is it a Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
From the developing country, Mom was Max, Life, Chile.
When I met my industry, he told us that since the boy, he wanted to know that the human being was interested: "The other species, intelligence, no, language, it's culture, no, it's humor, no.
One day, while talking to his father, he was very respectful, his father said, "Oh!
Isn't it my stupidity?
He heard a little light, and said he became the first stupid.
Comupidology is science that we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is it?
Audience: Yes.
That's absolutely...
One day, I like to remember Rolentor, a creator of biodiction, a great brother, and she told us that it should be a hipotalic idiot, be a good animal, from holidays to the chest that will be Bral.
The question is stupid because it reversed with rationality, a person can be highly stupid, and it's highly alert.
Rational.
To have qualified diplomas and universities.
And to do it as a person who is talking about developing, with graphs, sophisticated tunnels, as a person sitting at the branch of a tree, closing.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had it.
Two infinite things.
The universe is human stubbornness.
And he agreed: Einstein.
In relation to a universe, I still have.
But I need to say that I agree.
They are pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of Einstein's rules and Max Nefing, although they respect us and considering that the human being ...
We are born to be, to flourish, it's not your nature, stupidity, on the contrary, to serve, then.
I intend to think about comfort.
That 2600 years ago said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's completely, we are not born human.
And we make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen it, and goes to the sea,
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas, or to be in Juras?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, about developing emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, of learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50 I knew what the precets of the sky were.
When I was 60, I'd listen to sweet people.
In the 70s, I could follow the instructions of my own heart, because what I wanted wasn't that day, the borders of justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you exchange clothes in 5 million, it takes to be an entire existence to exchange roots.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The norm refers to an evolutionary establishment.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: Is it the 21st century for human beings?
And no less than this sees this swarm.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution of human beings, but the human being, as Tia Chartan said, is the space where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to now, to serve.
Someone asked for the IT.
Tell God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially?
I am.
"So? What do you mean?
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we hear doesn't happen to you.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once.
What?
A forest.
Not to give up.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flow!
who picked up a source, an water drop and played in the middle of the fire and returned, resiliently, another drop.
He would play me in the middle of fire, and return with patience.
The lines already burned.
I was in the middle of the man, "A Tartufo João, seeing that," said more, "Stay flower?
Do you think that with these bottle ridicles you'll erase this infernal fire?
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
I'm faced with everything.
Now, I'm doing my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes, with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way, because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little of peace, a little of order, a little of love.
In this small part of the world, where does the big world trust each one of us, and if we don't do that, where can we be facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions...
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
You want to breathe, a concept, right?
I do it with others, with others, with the world and with instant.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
We studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a giant narrative.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stand up.
And we can do our part, in fact.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came, each of us talking about their water had water.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, there's your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle.
