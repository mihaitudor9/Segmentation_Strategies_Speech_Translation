I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and yet.
Our children are getting very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
What if they rebel?
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't go well either: we may not commit more sincere crimes, I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll take it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Starting with her pregnancy, it's about to understand.
These seas.
She wants her mother.
He has a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
She then starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces Caii culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is harmful, dangerous, painful, that generates a shameful statistic in our country.
They are made by C-section.
It includes 15 to 20% of developed parents.
Remember that, of course, there are necessary cests for each one of these sines we're going to be, this makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical acute, a woman is hurt, immobilized, of course, she can be done well, but certainly won't have the same benefits with a normal impact.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, I'll tell you the truth: you can take a mammal here, a formula of milk milk in poop, in the case of its need, even hunger.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother got home, her mother, and said, "Mom, you grew up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, it's strong, the child is crying, so he's fray, in two months, this child's breastfeeding, and she loses the wonderful things the mother milk can offer."
The industry is prohibited to advertise.
For the consumer, but it adds the advertisement in itself by the names it gives to the forms, they premiere.
Have you experienced it?
Swiss!
In the maternal milk, he's entered, he's a lover.
But he, precisely, comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, they make their partner from the doctor.
By getting to know their nutritional qualities and congresses, and sponsoring entirely medical societies, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatrist, who end up consciously being one of the greatest causes of basic dismission.
And this way we're losing.
Social privileges are not an immigration.
Through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
My Gabriela grows, her mother will finish license, she'll have to go to the crew because she can't take care of vovement.
And it will spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution.
But when we get home, these parents are tired of tired of tired tires of long work, of helplessments, and they will live very little with their daughter.
There's still work to do at home, on weekends they'll pass.
And they'll take BAP to post-rababá, because after all, how many iron people do, and what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood, conviently.
Our children.
We regret ourselves so much with the dream and adolescence of this, and the child loses his relief with the most important people in their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone.
We're at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of external, sincere characterization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give frozen food, industrialized food, what supermarkets show to bright Brazilians, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging, traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderful healthy, by rich food.
In fat, saturated fat.
Namous excess of salt and sugar.
Crossing abroad, all the weapons that the industry, through highly developed food engineering, makes children completely addicted to industrialized food and, thus, unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
"And ...?"
This brings serious problems with diabetic obesity that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, that it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we are world consumption champions of agrotoxes, this is the sin.
From childhood intoxication, which also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a creation called "chequeerma," which has cables for four months, and somebody knows that, highly negative to the involvement of a child, she has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
However, our urban lives don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, enlighten me, and don't want if everybody is involved, so these children spend eight statistical people.
Eight to 10 hours connected to your devices today.
Again, connecting with the game device, it's great, but not eight hours later, children no longer have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
We looked at Janela, and saw a landscape passing in the form of meditation. However, today, two DVDs and two tablets for each one, if you can't do anything in the car.
Even in moments, this exists, people, even in moments when the child most needs - this exists, this comes from there, but you can say, "Ipnico," "Ipote."
(Laughter) That's the name, go for it.
And there's still a layer to cover the tablet, you'll look at the shell, right?
Even in the moments she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this makes us confin our children and prevent them to have a moment of consciousness, of void, of confinement and permanent distraction.
Bela watched four hours on TV per day.
It's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it spend at maximum four hours, and it spend more time on American TV, and in our work, sometimes, because we have less time at school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to Park, and she doesn't go to Park. The family does the classical show of the Brazilian family in the weekend, "O."
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, for consumer values, and this advertising is a wild obesity.
The mobility that explodes its capacity, to distinguish, which was to make reality, explore her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, gear inclusion.
And that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
In obesity, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drink, not even people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, it's obviously the one who most needs friendship are teenagers and they are deeply affected by child consumption.
Cabrela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of commitments.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, the wonderful thing: Who has never meditated in balance?
Look at the sky, look at the floor.
Look at being, there is no better meditation than that.
Hongoladeiro, with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: merudization.
that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products.
An organization based on sexism, the objectification of girls and women, the excessive value of the appearance and worse, in the Association of Sexuality.
Love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erodization, and this affects children directly deforming their mind when we have eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and early erotization.
There's peace that's afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put in a tribe, it becomes a family queen, and not a member of the family, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she's going bad at school, the school's guilt isn't authority, she's a little evil.
It gets insecure, it needs people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms. We know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, we interrupt ourselves between the experience of our children and the world.
Which means that they don't have a life experience and, therefore, don't develop mechanisms to connect with frustration, with pain, with difficulty, that certainly the world will deliver to them a childhood.
Well!
In front of so many problems, of course, childhood will give five pills, the child will be rebelled, "bigone," "birty," or "birty," they'll get sick, they'll eat too much, they'll get obese, they're bad at school, they don't pay attention, it's hyperactive.
We need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What did I love?
The solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give medicines, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in fact.
What the parliament is that it is producing exactly medicine, and that's what we're doing for our children, not only with alienate children, adults also in a pergonous way, the medicalization of phenomena, 15% of the children today are setting up the black, this individualist society.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most, the depressed, that we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, the way of medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and activity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't a disease epidemic, this is a massacre against childhood, we're rooting, "normatizing," and I'm sure some of these genius, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, we'd have lost that of wonderful warming.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths, and problems are very complex, I don't see, without end of sines and factors that feed each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simply, easy and invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I think we reflect on this, a well-known TEDx solution, I'm surely spending my time, but it's OK, I'm a little bit, a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And, in relation to time, what we can do, when we talk about sins, we're talking about penitence, penitence today means weight payment in almost all churches, the "décima" is to give part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, which is our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Our capital.
The most important thing is time.
The time?
We have 17 hours of age.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing.
And if it doesn't happen every week, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children in relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life.
It was a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
Look at your eyes.
Give me if you fit in this statement.
Isn't it?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows the importance of nature, in nature, is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with health, and deeply, these factors are all of us, we know this, what we don't know, and it had an interesting experience. I started that, with Patricia, who wasn't giving me my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!
I talked about convergence and health of sustainability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
Everything that causes health well makes the environment and vice versa: riding a bike, makes the body well, my cities, bottles, pollution, and collective transport for a long time, reduces the pollution, with my organicism, makes the Earth well, makes the animals good.
Things always go into slow in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, who will get to know each other and learn to deal with them, we'll develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physicist, mental, and then reduce all childhood problems.
Reducing children from nature and, when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about spaces when we dominate with the steps of time. Look, and now there'll be a bad space, no, we're talking about domination, the bread talking about skiping the wall.
And for the city, embrace the cities, go to play in the squares, take public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, with guest.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and also not only the initiative of physical users, that facilitate contact with public space with nature, that promote ciclovies, free events of these spaces, baking bathrooms, gardens in the city, public transport, to take us these places, safety.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocupaque," is practically used for citizen resistance today, it means to take public steps with joy.
And ...
Specially taking part in the city governance, the city governance is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as it happened in São Paulo, where you can see here, in a photo of the Birins Represa, a source of water from São Paulo, 30 to 40 years ago, and today.
By the mago-vernance?
And cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand.
Imagine the public policies voted to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
With transparency and accounts, there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this: to finish the same scientists, which announce a terrible crisis, reducing the inequality from the social point of view, and from the environmental point of view, of course, doing everything we already know.
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to the confinement, to empathy, we will learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature, because only experimenting.
The cold Kachoeira doesn't sell YouTube, it's that we learn more about that hen and defend in the future, what we only defend what we love, so, in short, this is our proposal: children, already outside, let's take public spaces with play, with fun, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing the gallery side phase that left us ...
Unfortunately, this year, he said that the utopia is on the horizon, the more I get closer, the more it moves away, if we take a thousand steps, it pushes a thousand steps, so what is the utopia exactly to not make us walk.
That it makes us walk abroad, thank you.
AC: In 2007, I came across a large group of young people and adults with disabilities excluded from regular education.
Since then, my biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion within school, with parents, with their children and partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they introduce this to parents, to the community, and to the society of general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think that they are not able to have friendships, to interact with people.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court, participating in all kinds of physical education and with teachers, for four years, he couldn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers, and people didn't have the strength for that too, so he loved to run, he kept running all the time.
(Laughter) When I got to the clean field, I sought to meet Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
so that he could get a better learning.
The school?
A paradise was a place of despair.
(Laughter) Well, it's not a championship, today he's very happy, he has classes with several teachers, he has many friends, he says that I'm the best friend of him and, for two years, he gave me present in his parents' day.
I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading, the school can teach autonomy, freedom of expression, and it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning.
The schools think that they aren't able to assist these students and that they are not prepared to receive, but schools need to overcome these difficulties and that these leaves inside the school.
To do well for them, it's going to do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
(Laughter) Because the choice is like this: "There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together."
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years conviving with disabled people?
(Laughter) I learned to appreciate my view, living with people who can't see it, I learned to use my hearing, living with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs with those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise of empathy, but the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students, to create connections and bonds of friendship.
CF: Good evening.
(Sigh) I always liked eating.
But I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
To cook, right?
Cozinhar, working in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Páscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
(Applause)
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
Food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a medicine month.
So I decided to study a little about Iurveda and macrobiology, because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took away from many of us young people, which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Trossé is a little of life.
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can connect with nature.
I said, "Oh, that's it.
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside.
And there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood we could use it.
It's food, food.
As a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that we ...
It's to do it.
Following the food system, changing the food dynamics, the production process.
Distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces.
The cheaper it is produced.
Worst is quality and...
The biggest is the cost of the environment, it's artificially accelerated and for our health in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle.
Elip.
He lost, he started to grow and produce in a way that his bodies...
There's a time that doesn't help, and it starts to lose, decrease in painfully its quality of life.
Your health and your life time.
So?
I believe that we ...
It could and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized.
This is very complex because, as it may cost so little, you can create an animal from birth to abate.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process on the industrial scale is also a lot.
Let's say this harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, nowadays, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agro toxic farms in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society ...
There are inverted values, there is an investment of values, why does a person worry?
In not buying a failed perfume because you think it's gone.
There's an allergic reaction because it doesn't know the procedure, it doesn't know which type of chemistry is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal.
Right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, a pack of organic leface, you're paying, not only you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go, instead of one on social media, many times they don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of, with all love and affection, and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think...
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason.
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption.
Also...
It's the way we...
Today, consuming food is scary, my grandmother is a paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
And if I take her in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Seeing those executives or those appreciated people walking down the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because catting is something that people, many people think it's a waste of time, but, in fact, it's very important.
You're almost five.
But because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the streets, which is very...
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these nostalgia, biscotites and such also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo-duriaçúcar," which are the three altrugicious, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated a physical dependence, but a psychological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products are too harmful, I don't even call them food. For me, they are made up of food, because you can even consume, if the website does, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorn in the place of microwonds, look?
(Laughter) This question may seem: these two questions may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you change the panick from the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health because you're going to half.
It's consuming.
These are chemicals that you wouldn't put, I'm surely absolute, in your panick, and you're also polluting with the packaging of microonds, of an exact packaging that could be less trash in the world.
This cycle of industrialized products is really predeficient.
So, let's talk ...
"Yes ...
To summarize this question of the food production process, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not sweet.
Very good.
If it's not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Traveling brings independence, brings high self-awareness, gives autonomy.
Bring safety, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
And I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you?
"Yes ...
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Lazanha, frozen, frozen battle, hamburger, blind dog...
What about a pizza?
And it gives them the disquipizza, because even pizza, we know how to do more, so I believe we ...
"Ah! I don't know
"Oh no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean of each day?
Who had our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, who think that making food is very worky, it's very anti-pathetic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean from night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a street, fresh that you do in 20 to 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
To wait or twice as Pitt.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
Menine, girl.
Children, adult and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education.
We teach children, bringing the children to the fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can...
It's to build a better future, these children will grow.
A holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think they come from the supermarket shelves, so the kids go.
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutical industry, because they'll be much less sick.
Knowing, eating cash food, healthy food.
I believe we have to ...
Change.
Addynamics.
We have to change our food.
Or, "Yes."
Our value.
Too ...
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thanks to license, education.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention.
So?
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose the food well?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
(Video) Life is not the one we lived, but it's the one we wake up and wake up to tell.
Who's going through the bottom?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother and had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five brothers.
I arrived in this world, happened yesterday, and we, at 50 years ago, are the stories we tell, that make us who we are.
It also transforms itself.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
We are our story before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored, all stories.
Still my passion for stories started very early, I always liked writing, reading, telling, and in school, I even wrote a book about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me to experience mourning.
I know he helped a lot of people too, so having told this story, for me, brings one of the most beautiful things about it, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in each other's story, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously I'm someone.
Come on, you'll sit on your lap of this story and feel welcomed.
(Laughter) But then, one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood at 45 years that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
And I said, "Oh!
Help people to tell their stories because the publicity world had been very small for me.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, and I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so uncomfortable for us, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying.
Because that's what he's always suffered.
And he wanted it.
dividing the story with others, and I left because it had to do with the subject, except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints.
A right about all that had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and, otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can accept who they are, as we've already said here, without fear?
He was understanding this, changing the top, and, on the day, Tiago ...
He grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
"And ...?"
I like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also to have seen that the roots they imagined that Tiago had nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell him his story.
A lot of people.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that he wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that I didn't have any shame.
So, tell stories to me?
They cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm bringing many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Tell something funny shows your children's pictures, but not really.
I think this is not the most important thing.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
AS: That's it?
I told the story of "Ave," the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, and he researchs listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDx Lossador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before everything.
From his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this, every time you talk to me, you say, it's all here for everything here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk.
About listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was heard, when he needed the most, when he thought about it, this is a place when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many equation courses, oratory and writing.
But who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we'll change.
So we talk about change, but...
There's always this fear.
And, like this moment, we always arrive and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And to the others, and to listen?
You see, also, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
There's no one minute, it scratches us.
To look at others, to come hug and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) But after hearing his talk, another TEDx returned.
MA: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various I heard, outside all the others.
When she taught me that empathy too, I learned high school.
Why?
We need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We always have it.
We have at least a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
(Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today, to teach something, to make art. Many people asked me, "Man, after all, why do you like doing that so much, why are you doing this, listen, and tell him too?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me?
And for everyone, I gave a poem I wrote myself, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I want to free many of the people I know, to give them the key of their lives, to give them faith in life.
Faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change the right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know, to free their story, that, despite being important, it's not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Thank you.
(Sigh) The truth is that on Earth, to be told to me, that I don't belong to many spaces, or you may say there are judgments, where there are all types of stars and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they are only part of their plurial places, there is no swing lady or thin, pretty ugly, rich and poor.
It's just a legacy of existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed over my life, a phase in which I was denied the right of just being.
I don't look for acceptance, but, in respect, from the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
So, why are we here below, so small, we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and understanding definitely that what is different, the universe is infinite, along with them, millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other?
Audience: Yes.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals, so that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
The different thing is beauty, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this wants to be rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
(Laughter) But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and if it was denied for me?
The best thing is why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different from that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it's about the trans universe, this path is harder, I've researched the Internet, but let's see people like me, and during my 21 years old, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitating, and that desire to grow up inside me, I already want to become transsexual too, like this, everyone coming, so she thought and started the wrong way.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started to look for my true teenage years and I started to get rid of it, because of this process, it has painful phases and not everyone is there to deal with it.
It's very difficult when you're in the middle of a mixture of transformations, and if you're a black woman, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily, and you still have to learn to deal with the not acceptance of others, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, is it that you're transhumed, our new thing? There are no traffic guys, no, you're phase, you're going to pass?"
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is there any gourm here who wants to see this auditation?
As a white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil, in 2016, many other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
To be a transsexual in the option.
But in a living condition.
There's no magic formula, there's no strength, no strength, resistance, expectation of 35 years, there's no expectation; whoever fats like this, that we could better measure this panel, but it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, for each one of us, the protagonist of your own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
I'm dependent on ourselves, for example, I'm the living proof of that, after I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use mine.
My art, as a way of deconstruction of ideas, to establish myself, I was invited to live a trans character, I was wearing a model, magazine layer, J, and "perform" and Thuber, and in "APsystem" career for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(End of music) It's a responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
But, I did, abused, I went to my name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "They're filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What's no price?
The price is to receive message from other trans women's mothers, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
Understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world, but, precisely, I understand that I don't want to be only three trans, but I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond trans, but to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky?
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was I?
One will be there.
It moves so blue.
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky.
Your and me.
I don't look at myself anymore, I don't ask myself to stop.
I've already got away from my corridors.
From the past, only what remain their scars, that mark my soul.
Well, the future.
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being on the side, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried.
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I've never been able to explain to children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian section, that doctors called "teratoma," one of them said, "Geee, we open our heads, open our belly to take down tumors, it won't take a seventure." Well, it had been called with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do a surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been established, given point: nothing.
And it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and noted.
The same yesterday I was with children with cancer, and I looked down, was full of tubes and connections.
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's no visiting time."
And I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
I cut only after the bedroom, I needed cancer, measures and committed gangs.
I'd say to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, not when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website, and the only thing that happened to me ...
That the safe information at that moment was that I would die.
Because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of cure, and then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
which sometimes didn't help, who didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "cluster"?
And I was stubborn.
And ...
Opening what bothered me, forgotten, cold, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
(Laughter) Then I realized.
This information from society, for them to have hair, in fact, it wasn't for me.
They knew it was for them.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with that I saw many other information that I thought wasn't the most suitable.
(Laughter) When I got to the hospital, a doll, the children said, "Wow, you launched your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer, I've got it for you.
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed and the kids started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I went to...
I'll add the cateter, because I did my therapy before, the first one made a portrait, I receive a hospital kit.
Here at this kit, a sabonete came, a glass and a toothbrush, but also a shampoo, a beam.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
For me, this is information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We started playing, but we think that children don't understand, they think they don't know, they know the name of chemotherapy, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try to not talk to protect them, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, what they'll find.
That will fall our hair, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it killed cells that quickly doubled.
But not only the tumor cells doubly quickly, but also the hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working and began to engage the children, and the doctors started to call me."
If there's a patient who'll place catéter, you can come here, and then I'll spend a lot of time listing what we illustrated in terms, but I have two legs, "Oh, but, with one thing, if it seems, you don't need to be explained when you like someone, and you wrote the BABABABABABABABA do cancer," and we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, the patient is an ecological one, and we don't have an ecological one.
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is distributed for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and what is required in Northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate, that children will do.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
No kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when it's events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't exist.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and I thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to spend the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need self-esteem.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
Audience: Yes.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important: I went to the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
(Laughter) In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the pair, I just don't stop what I don't want."
And, fortunately, this isn't easy, because the dependency here gives me illness and brain disease, and a disease that complicates a lot people's lives.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, really, the answer has?
In us, in order to treat chemical dependence, and if, in fact, these patients are right.
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of those defense that can protect itself from great threats, this organism that has its own defense mechanisms, called "barring emato in being a factory."
The myatocefal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and that make bacteria and non-violent substances don't enter the brain and don't do bad for our heads, and that's why they end up being able to act and act in our brain, in the recompense circuit, in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
AC: Our immune system is composed by anticorpos cells and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrofogo and neutralize it.
I said, "Wow, that's it.
Can we not join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities, realized that these people who used more drugs against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
It's enough.
There's no need for more drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) I and my team.
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enters our immune system, produces anticpios and anti-codfos are big molecules, and then that problem that medical barrier had to let the drugs go freely, doesn't exist, because when the user consumes drugs, this tiny molecule is linked to a large and pum molecule, no longer passes on the barrier.
Look at this image here how this process is so beautiful, once we were able to imunize them, these white dots you can see is a cocaine molecule marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Besides that, we asked ourselves, where did it stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a much greater behavior in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that beyond the box, they could be a treatment, as if they didn't realize that they had received the drugs, that they had received the drugs.
What knows, in a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time.
A time to decide, a time to gain freedom in the new and...
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much.
I'm being.
Interapute.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to read and say that -
Besides.
Danorose.
What's more?
In psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
At the end of everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
Whether it's hurting, loses, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Patology of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
Get it out.
Great meeting, TEDx?
I was born by hand.
It's here.
"Oh no, music is being."
It was stunned from the beginning.
What do we love?
There are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example, is an example, maybe the most mortifero.
What is it?
Our lady.
Up to where I can comprehend, there are two fundamentals of the most important of the norm, which is the location.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
I'd respect the fact that not always.
The norm didn't exist.
It won't always exist.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times...
What do we live in a context?
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It doesn't predict corruption.
Dishumanity in its word.
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This is adapting to a sick system and kept it?
I've been.
A worker?
There's more than 30 in one year.
from the International University of Paz.
Or Unipas.
And people think that peace is to be a good one.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars, I said, I came ... a little bit of payments.
The soldier for peace.
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
It's the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes...
The person should, that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of it.
It seemed to my family.
When is my daughter Isabela?
She was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked her.
What princess do you like most?
The ballet sheet, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought.
And he answered.
I like all the May's writing.
I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it is sensitive to feel in your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
That "normotic" don't feel them.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive, who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
There are hundreds of forests.
And being deertified, and these people desmaved.
I respect a lot.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
People considered crazy in Africa are also considered safe.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
Sistendic, and sometimes I fail.
And how did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And don't talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call ...
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least I have the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is in Armodes, we don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here.
It's short, guys.
"Uh."
The taxist, knowing I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He raises himself to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's silly.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand?
What do I want for you?
They formed love.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
What's nothing against correctness?
At that moment, "Hi!
who suffered a distress!
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo.
From racism, it gives homophobia.
Of various?
Esclusions: namorous.
We could talk about the norm, it's environmental.
Nermosis gives it.
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything.
(Laughter) And that health care takes the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, the minimum, the minimum, it doesn't realize, its existence has no sense, we are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is extremely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about...
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe there's a concept.
In this education, which has also been here.
Very good.
How could it be a solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The desire that brought us incarnation.
It's what's on us on a stage like this.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just to a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it'll penetrate.
So ...
In the foundation of norms?
Where?
The Situationant.
There's an egg.
Very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said.
Today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
But a human species of other species.
What interests us?
From now on.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I ask a friend of Unippace.
A Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
From the developing country, mother was Max, Nife, Chile.
When I met my adoption, he told us that, since he was a child, he wanted to know that the human being was different.
Of the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
One day, talking to his father, he was very respected.
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
(Laughter) It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousness, who is absolutely lit a little light, and says that it's become the first estupidologist, stupidology, science that we need to study.
And he told us that you need to be an Indian, I like to remember the creator of biodiction, a great brother.
The hipotanic language, to be a good animal from holiday to the chest which will be white?
The question.
It's stupid because it reversed with rationality, a person can be highly stupid, and it's also rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Stranged.
Fabrics and make it as a person talking about developing with graphs.
Sufisticable?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, shaking it.
"Of course."
"Nice," he also said.
What for him?
I had ...
Two infinite things.
The universe is human stubbornness.
And he agreed, "Yes, autism, in relation to a universe I still have my doubts."
But I need to say that I agree.
Diainist and Max Nefing, although, respecting them.
And considering that they are pointing not to the species's characteristics, yes, of the norm.
Human beings?
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
To serve, then?
I prefer to think of confuse.
That, 2600 years ago, said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inaccabating, it's completely.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans, a Taruga is born tartaruga, you've seen and goes to the sea.
We don't.
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
Have you ever heard of school for turtles or Tana Juras?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems to be necessary to develop a rational demonstration, no.
It's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul of psyche, developing emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Obceive?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the instructions of my own heart because what I wanted to not anymore, the borders of justice anymore.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you change clothes.
And five minutes, I can be an entire existence.
It was exchange.
From Corrice.
This is the task.
In that sense?
The norm refers to an evolutionary stability.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: will there be the 21st century for human beings?
Nothing less than that finds this paradox.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in silencing, people don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being.
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to get to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to speak, to be come.
Someone asked for the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
He said, "Yes."
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially!
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to "nonipas".
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was arrested.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flowers.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
I used to play in the middle of fire, and I got back with patience.
Hands.
Get married, I used to play in the middle, "Intactufo, João, seeing that..." said, "But, do you see flowers?
Do you think that with these drops, will you erase this infernal fire?
And as a result, I say, "I know I don't."
A child of everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with two intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little.
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions.
And, failed, and I keep failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
I do it with others, with others, with the world and with the assistance.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
These spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a ground sloth radio.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stand up.
And we can do our part, in fact.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you're here, you don't need to be on this stage, but on the stage.
You have your life story.
Telling your story.
and taking them back ...
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle.
Maybe just complain.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with the poem.
Let's analyze them.
Renevant.
I went to Tilesco.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen you, created others for other visions.
They built arms that had this meadow.
To forgotten the harvest.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
But always.
Alone.
Always far.
And inside.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
I entered a good school.
Decorus.
I got good grades.
Choice is a job that will define you for the rest of your life as a child.
(Laughter) I always have to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a markers, since my first has a income.
I choose a university of resignation, of public preference.
And they spend four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
(Laughter) I see a video game: some multinational name recognized by their relatives.
Whether it's "treming," I work 12 hours per kidney, up to the limit of their strength.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
AC: Do interactive meetings, video games that won't take anywhere, show that you're important for the structure.
And more than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
He, the Minioponents, car a six fallakes point (Laughter) finds someone, nurturing, nurturing, marriage, stays the corporate pyramid.
He sees the shirt, lambotas.
The job exchange.
LP: Be a manager.
Carre of the firm.
(Laughter) "They want the freel in happy hour marked."
S: We're badly cut and sneakers.
I said, "Dad the shirt."
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son is to hear each other.
(Laughter) Take the car for a year, yes, last year, Europe, Miami ... (Laughter) Disney, two years later, turns seven days through Europe, I buy an apartment in 130 convictions, projects that start and dismiss their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
Take a shirt.
(Laughter) The first apartment on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle school crisis, the meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years, went fast, is, life is short.
(Applause)
My children in school, my God, as they grown fast, is short life.
Audience: Yes.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we are going to sell the beach apartment, children grew up and don't even want to go further, to see the shirt.
(Laughter) The cholesterol is a little high, its fluid body, like an astronaut that spent years floating in zero gravity, (Laughter) No meat on account of the healthy habit of passing toothpaste feet after all infections.
Lut it out, cold lactose, green juice, semestal plan of the academia that you used for two months today is fourth, days of beet, liver hamburgues, after staying late, in the sign, to close a project, because life is too short to eat leface.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing a job, today, doesn't value the experience anymore.
The fear of everything, the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
The continuous fear that prevents you from living.
Met of death, a brief sense of suffocation, where the air, otherwise the suffering.
The complete disconnection with your children decreased from the 12 hours of work for decades: the empty retirement surrounded by useless and unhappy things; you're a winner, this is your only consolo.
I'm the life of an executive executive.
(Applause) Thank you, seen the wood shirt for the real time.
