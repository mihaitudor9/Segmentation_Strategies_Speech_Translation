(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
She'd say, "What is the true character of a society revealed?"
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of the most precious.
We want well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and yet.
Our children are getting very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what are most of them?
Already against Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food.
We treat violence.
What if they rebel?
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't go well either: we make, maybe, not more sincere crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
We'll get it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Starting with her pregnancy, you can see it.
These seas.
The mother of Gabriela ...
Do you want it?
He has a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
She then starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
It's a highly lie remedy, but it's very convincing, so convincing.
which produces Caii culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that birth ...
It's normally harmful, dangerous, painful.
It generates a shameful statistic in our country.
Ninety and 3 percent of births in the private network, for example, in Rio de Janeiro, 93 percent.
They are made by C-section.
It includes 15 to 20% of developed parents.
This generates huge benefits for children, this makes meat of loss, which is this moment of love.
He host a medical surgeon, with an adopted woman.
Inmobilized it's clear that it can be humanized and can be done well, but certainly it won't have the same benefits as normal birth, remembering that, of course, there are necessary meetings for each of these sines that we'll be.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I left maternity.
One of the many pediatrists that can be there.
Working, it's going to tell reality: you can take only a refrigerator, a formula like that, of milk in poop, in the case of it, needed, and it's hungry.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother goes home and says, "You've grown up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, strong?"
The child is crying, every month is cold, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise.
For the consumer, but it adds the advertisement in itself by the names it gives to forms, awareness.
Have you experienced it?
Swiss!
In the breast milk, he's a lover.
But he, precisely, comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, they do their marriage doctor.
By getting to know your own ...
nutritional diversity asking them to develop babies.
And sponsoring with a bunch of prizes and dinneries and congresses and sponsoring integrally the medical societies.
It's a question of the sympathetic of the pediatrist who ends unconsciously being one of the biggest houses of basic income.
This way, we're losing.
Social privileges are not a meditation, and ...
Through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the permit, she'll have to go to the bucket, because vovão can't take care of it.
And it will spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution.
He'll get home, his parents are tired of tiredness, of long-to-day routine, of traffic jams, and they'll live little with his daughter.
There's still work to do at home, right?
At the weekend, they're going to pass.
And they'll take babies in post-herrababa because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood: convince.
Our children.
We regret ourselves so much with the childhood dream of this, and the child loses his contact with the most important people in their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone.
To be at home with this person?
These are our precious children, and we are losing this because of exterrible, sincere characterization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have gender to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give food, frozen, industrialized food.
What do supermarkets show their brilliant shelves?
They end up exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy.
Why a rich food?
In fat, saturated fat -
Unnormous accesss of salt and sugar.
Black people out there, lovery inside, all the weapons that the industry, through food engineering, highly developed.
What do you do?
so that children can be completely addicted.
The industrialized food and in this way unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
What about it?
This leads to serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploded in childhood.
Even if we want to provide food, that we consume healthy food for our children, it's not so healthy because it's given agrotoxis data, we're world champions of agrotox consumption, this is sin.
From the intoxication of childhood that also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and somebody knows that highly negative we are involved with a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
However, our urban lives don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they enlighten me, and don't want the whole world to flood.
These children spend eight.
Guys, this is statistic.
Eight to 10 hours connected to your devices today.
Again, connecting with the game device, it's great, but not eight hours later, children no longer have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
I remember when I traveled the car with my children, we played, it was an incredible moment.
From the car, a child is a wonderful thing: we played "Dedanha," who played "Dedanha," here, the country chose the letter B, right?
We played, played people, it was a moment of family relief, of laughing humour, of things that stay in our memory of us in childhood.
We looked at the window, we saw landscape passing in the form of meditation.
However, today it's two duties and two states for each one, if it can't do anything in the car.
Even in moments, that exists, guys.
Even in moments when the child most needs that exists, this comes from there, but you can do it.
Impinic, the hypothesis.
That's the name, porn.
It still comes with a layer to cover your tablet on a searched look, right?
Even in moments when she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer to her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction.
This makes us confin our children.
And preventing them to have moments of consciousness, of void.
Ask me?
TED is fundamental in childhood because TED and void are bercers of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination.
We're breastfeeding this from our children.
With this sin, confinement and permanent distraction.
Gabriela watched four hours of TV per day.
It's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it spend at maximum four hours and spend more time on television.
Americans were in records and in our work, sometimes because we have less time in school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the stool, "A family does the classic family program today in week, which is ...?"
Well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, by consumer values.
This advertising is a private university.
The mobility that explodes its ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
who explore her love by characters, doing what she ...
If you fall in love with toxic products, with expensive toys and brands, the inclusion of this love?
And that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
utility in worse things.
And what will it be like?
In obesity, even in glass consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, not people, advertisement is totally liberated and always confused from friendship behind.
Obviously, the ones who need friends are the teenagers, and they are deeply affected by the beer's commercial and welcoming, in adolescence, is growing scary.
This is the sin in childhood mercantilization and child consumism.
Gabriela is with the agenda full of commitment, because her parents want that to be competitive, an adult of very successful.
And your agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, a wonderful language: Who has never meditated balance?
Look at the sky.
Look at the floor.
Look at the being.
There's no better meditation than that!
"Let's spend money with another class," and then it'll be exposed to that.
The type of erotization is that our society proposes, "Merodization."
Who uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell products?
It's fashion.
An organization based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse.
In this "Secution of Sexuality."
Love is affection, this is our way of semestering erudization, and this affects children directly deforming their mind when we have eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and early erotization.
Gabriela?
There's peace that fears her, because they don't live with her.
So, instead of limiting them, they put them in a tribe.
It becomes the family queen and not a member of the family, it starts to decide the programs, the cardboard, if it's going bad at school, the school's fault, we have to go talk to a teacher.
She gathers a lot, if what she needed would be presence.
She realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have the authority, a child, sometimes two or three years old, who realizes that their parents don't have the authority, and she's a little evil.
She feels insecure, she needs people who lead her life.
This generates anxiety and generates symptoms.
We know that the importance of limits aren't fundamental forms of love, we need to give to our children and we're losing this ability instead.
We're doing what the Americans are of Hélicopstrape before.
We interrupt ourselves between children's experience and the world.
But I'm not that they don't have life experiences, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, with pain, with difficulty, that surely the world will give them later, this is a sin.
from the organization and the superpower in childhood.
In front of so many problems, it's clear that childhood will give five "pumas," the child will be rebelled.
Brigone, pepper, it'll get sick, it'll eat too much, it'll be obese, it's going bad at school, it doesn't pay attention, it's hyper-perative.
We need to do something about it.
It's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these children.
The poor people put in jail.
What did I love?
The solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late for them to behave well.
This is called medicalization and it's the worst of a sin.
The quino de Mafalda says this, "Rettable is a wonderful girl, he tells the story of a city.
Followed by a terribly polluted factory, people are going bad because of the sheet.
When they go to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home.
She buys a medicine in the pharmacy.
Who doesn't show us here, in fact?
What the factory is producing exactly the medicine.
Isn't it?
This is what we are doing with our children, not only with alienate children, adults also, in a way, having water in laser.
Medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are as big as prey, with this competitive society.
The three employees are the market that grows the most for depressants.
Let's get to this point.
And Ritalina, such as medicine, which is for the disorder of attention and hyperactivity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes.
In 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This is not a disease epidemic, this is a massacre against childhood.
We are returning.
Normalizing.
And preventing children from being ourselves.
And I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if any of these geniuses, in humanity, had now in school...
It would be exactly this: rotated or not martized.
We'll have amputed her genius and we'll have lost that of wonderful third grains.
So we can see that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths.
And problems are very complex, I don't see them at the end of sines and factors that self-alimentate each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity ...
As the philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simple, easy.
Probably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
It was what we reflect on this, a very widespread TEDx solution, I'm already going through and going to spend my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time.
And space, but nothing.
In relation to time?
What can we do?
When we talk about sins, we're talking about penitence and punishment today.
It means "attachment dismo," in almost all churches.
The décima is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, which is our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Our capital.
More importantly, it's time.
The time?
We have 17 hours of age.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing.
And if it doesn't happen every week, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds.
Let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds.
I imagine a healthy place.
A healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, is a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health and quality of life.
It was a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
Look open your eyes.
Give me if you fit in this statement.
Isn't it?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows the importance of nature in nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul.
We know what makes us healthy, not a doctor, hospital, medicine, all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and it had an important and interesting experience.
I started here with Patricia, who back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible?"
I talked about the convergence to auditability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
All health does well the environment and vice versa good.
To ride bike, to make my body, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transport does well.
Congress time reduces stress, reduces pollution.
My organicist who was a body event, does good for the rivers, does good for the earth, sees the animals.
Things always go around in a positive way, creating always viciosous.
And the invitation with nature, probably said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce consumption of excessive material.
It will promote the play book that will generate intelligence, humour, imagination, creativity.
It will generate convivial among families, loving coexistence.
IBGE was delivered between different children who will meet each other.
and learn how to deal with them.
Men develop empathy, promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces well being physic, well being psychic, mental.
And it will reduce all childhood problems, this is scientific, I don't know what I'm talking about, it's the studies that show it is.
Two obesities, aggressiveness, joy, we work, improves immunity, improves socialization and schooling, in a wonderful way.
He goes to children through nature.
And when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about spaces when mines with the steps "gourmir," you see, and now there'll be a bad space, no, we're talking about domination before.
We're talking about jumping the wall.
And for the city, to embrace the cities.
and play in the squares, occupy public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, with guest.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, but also not only the initiative to use physics, it has been reivindicating because of this that facilitates us with public space and nature, that promote bikes.
Free events, these spaces, neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Thoughts that are accessible and well-carded, all that is actually called occupation of a city, the word "ocuparketically."
It used for resistance and citizens nowadays.
Does this mean, occupy public spaces with joy?
And ...
Mainly participate in the governance of cities.
The city governance is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as happened in São Paulo.
Here you can see a photo of the company "Birens," a source of water from São Paulo for 30 to 40 years.
And today?
By the mago-vernance?
And cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation.
They're back, and do people demand?
Imagine the public policies voted to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
With transparency to complain, there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this.
Even here in Borta Legue.
And it's cool for us to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce.
A terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming here, will come very early.
Are the kids going to take my rent?
They also say that 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis.
Reducing inequality from the social point of view and the environmental point of view, of course, doing everything we already know, right?
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking children outside, bringing children to the square, now.
For this invitation, for empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because they're only experimenting.
The cold box doesn't sell YouTube, it's that we learn to love this little box and defended in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children already outside.
Família already abroad.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces, play, play.
With entertainment, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing a phase of the gallery side that left us ...
Unfortunately, that year, unfortunately.
He said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes one thousand steps.
What is utopia good for?
Exactly to not make it walk.
It makes us walk abroad. (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2007,
And I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disability.
Labouts of regular school.
And since then?
What's my biggest challenge?
To look and see a lot of efficiency.
Of these people?
They are affected by their disabilities.
So I created the project called "Café terapêutico."
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a truly inclusive society?
to discuss inclusion within school.
But let's do it.
And with the pairs.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
They can get many things they can do.
And in this project, they presented this.
What do you do?
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities -
Sometimes they're left aside.
Have friends.
They can't think they are not capable.
to have friendships.
It's feeling like acting with people.
I put the case of the student Igor, for example.
What was the other school he studied?
For four years he didn't get into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
People didn't have the strength either.
Throughout four years ...
He stayed in the court.
I'm taking part in all physical education lessons.
As he loved running.
He was running all the time.
Checking isn't a clean field.
I tried to know Igor in a global way.
Therefore, knowing what he liked to do.
What's his interest at school?
And what together could we do?
So that he could ...
They improved the best learning.
The school?
A paradise was the place.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
Today, he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
A healing.
It's learning itself.
They think.
That they are not able to assist these students and that they are prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
He has to use it.
And believe it.
And they are capable.
and that of children.
Inside the school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do well to other students.
For the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see possibilities.
Developed from the other.
Why is school like this?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I learned at the age of ten years living with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view.
To survive with people?
You can see it.
I learned.
I said this.
My reduction?
Not living with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
Or those who have many times.
It has difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned ...
It was the value of my heart.
And the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendships.
And what's most important for society?
It's learning.
It's an exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) (Music)
Good evening.
NJ: Yes.
I always liked it ...
To eat.
But I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
Cozinhana.
She cooks, work in the kitchen, she'd take account.
Next year, Christmas rays, Páscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer.
What I want to give to you today.
Because if there's something that can change the future of food ...
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
Then, Oga transformed me, transformed my life completely.
It gave my view of the world.
It changed my diet.
How does she?
I started, I realized that...
And I did.
Foods had...
You can say it like that.
And I also decided ...
Studying food philosophies that could use.
Food as a common prevention form.
Cour and treatment of diseases.
What kind of medicine are we doing?
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
Because these philosophy revealed something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
It's the way we do.
We build the food system.
Through food.
What do I do?
I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization -
It's the detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life.
I don't believe it's people ...
I tried.
It's a little ...
In life.
In rural, for the city, we can strengthen the lakes.
Between humans and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can...
It's to connect with nature.
What about it?
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside.
And there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
Food, food...
As a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health.
Also improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
That's what we keep with.
It's to do it.
Restrutural the food system.
It gives the dynamic ...
It gives food.
of production?
Distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example.
of meat production process, for example.
There are two principles that lead.
The meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed.
What's more?
What is produced?
The cheaper.
And it produces.
Worst is quality.
And ...
Memor is the cost of the environment and our health in terms of speed.
The animal's cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle.
It's artificially accelerated.
He ...
He lost, he started to grow and produce in a way that his bodies...
"Ah! I don't know
I arrive an hour that is not delayed.
And he begins to lose, decrease drastically.
Your quality of life.
It's your health and your life time.
"So? What do you mean?
I believe that we ...
It can and must change this life system.
I was passing the other day at the supermarket this food system.
I realized.
That Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can you do it?"
This is very complex because how can it cost so little?
You create an animal.
From birth to abate.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables.
The production process, right?
In the industrial scale?
It's too much.
We say it's harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment.
Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
And I believe people, you know?
The benefits of agrotoxics.
But even so ...
They keep polarizing.
Bouses or not.
In use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer ...
And our current society?
There's inverted values, there's an investment of values.
Why does a person worry?
If you don't buy a failed perfume, because you think it's going ...
There's an allergic reaction because it doesn't know the procedure doesn't know which type of chemistry is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal.
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover this change of values, and we need to teach people.
to appreciate organic products because, for example, how much do you buy a pack of lettuces?
It's a bit of organic interface, you're paying, not only ...
You're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people can't see if they had been born many times.
While behind that leface there was someone who cared for all love and care.
And she took this leface to you.
So we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why ...
I...
I think I fell in love.
And for culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution?
It's also not efficient.
I think...
You must know that we produce lots of food.
It's the third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why we're going hungry, and the reason there are still people.
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption?
Also...
It's the way we...
Also with food today, it's scary, my grandmother is Pulista, she lives in São Paulo.
If I took her, put it on.
In the middle of Paulista Avenue.
I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Looking at those executives or those depressed people?
Walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because cigaring is something that people think is a waste of time.
I think it's true.
It's very important.
She'd go, anyway.
You do a fivepiece.
But because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the streets, which is very...
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reverber.
A way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of Salvador and sugar, which are the three dogs.
This is trufficient, right?
And these, mainly, the taste reuses ...
They end up destroying our paladar.
They degenerated our nervous system.
They end up creating a dependency, they don't suffer physics.
But a mental dependence, a psychological dependency.
a physiological dependency.
That is, industrialized products in excess are very harmful.
I don't even call them food, for me they are food-up comeds, because you can even consume, if the website does, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panick?
That panel poop in the place of a microphone.
The microwaves: "Look!
Half half... (Laughter) Who here is still a cake?
Instead of buying that little bag with a package.
Hi, too, half a half ... (Laughter)
Audience: Yes.
This question ...
These two questions may seem a little harmless.
"Yeah, not wanting ...
It doesn't mean anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, just for you to change.
Pan for panels, for microwaves' popcorn.
You're already causing a dam.
For your health, because you're going ...
It's consuming.
Chemics that you wouldn't put, I have absolute certainty.
I'm a panick.
And you're also polluting with the packaging of microwaves, it's a packaging that could be.
It's being less trash in the world.
So I think that consumption ...
It's excessive to produce industrialized, it's very...
Be judicial.
That's it.
So, it's ...
For us to talk ...
"Yes ...
To summarize?
And this is the question of the process ...
The production of food, I think...
It's very difficult.
This dynamic to feed this food system?
It's not sweet.
OK?
It's not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Play brings independence, brings high.
self-knowledge brings autonomy.
Bringing security, bringing freedom.
To cook is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let ...
The industry feeds you.
That's it.
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Ganha, frozen...
Bats, hamburgers, dry dog.
What about a pizza?
(Sigh) And then the discipleizza, because not even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe that we ...
I said, "Ah...
"Oh, no, man."
Where is the rice the bean in every day?
Who had our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, who think that making food is very workful, very anti-pathetic, is waste of time.
But, for example, if you leave the bean in the mock at night, wake up in the morning.
And then ...
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel.
As you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
It has to be frozen for the rest of the week.
Sunding with a street, fresh who you do in 20 to 30 minutes.
More legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, in half an hour you have the ready meal.
This might be at the same time.
What would you take to wait for pictures to arrive?
To wait or twice as Pizza.
Isn't it?
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking.
Everybody can.
They have to cook.
Men, women.
Menine, girl.
Children, adult.
Great.
There's no ...
There's no website, no sex.
There's no gender.
Everybody can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children taking their fair to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner.
She's putting children to dedicate a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can...
These children will grow, build a better future.
A holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
We think it comes from the supermarket shelter.
So, the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the industry.
Because they will become pharmaceutical.
Very less sick.
Having a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to ...
That's it.
Dynamics.
We have to change food.
Our ...
I say, "Oh, oh."
Our value...
Why?
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act.
How am I going to eat?
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Education ...
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
It has a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, healthy food.
This has at least hospitals.
It's education.
It's education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food?
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose.
Well, food.
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Life is not here that we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Who's going deeply?
To talk about the power of transforming stories?
It's about passing through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I'd come back as a child.
Do the vacations, my cousins, my brothers.
And also for family parties.
My torment, Mario Güeyuça.
It was the first swimming plant.
Filve mechanized in Brazil.
Here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother.
They had seven children inside my mother.
"Hi, did you bring my father?"
After having had my five siblings.
I arrived in this world.
Actually?
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell.
that make us be who we are.
And by containing them, we transform ourselves.
Who listens?
And it also transforms.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
But...
We are our story.
Before looking at this future ...
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early, I always liked to write.
To read, to tell?
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos."
He talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me to experience mourning.
And I know that he helped a lot of people too.
So having used this and told this story?
For me, it brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
What is the power that people can ...
They feel welcomed in each other's story, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously I'm someone.
Go.
I saw and will sit on the color of this story and feel welcomed.
Then came a day when I met this world here.
CED, TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
about products.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change.
I needed to expand.
And I went there.
Help people to tell their stories.
Because the publicity world had become very small to me.
So I started doing this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk ...
Two years ago, she's bringing TEDx.
Overview.
Interpretentism with purpose.
Things are fashionable nowadays.
But he brought me another challenge.
It was about bullying.
Because that's what he's always suffered.
And he wanted it.
dividing the story with others.
And I left because I had to do with the subject.
Except that I water you.
How much were we prepared to talk about it?
He always came with a lot of badness, and always a lot of complaint.
A right?
Especially what they had done with it.
But what's the goal of telling a story, to be to keep complaining about who did that with us?
And if not, to inspire people ...
that they can accept themselves and take responsibility for who they are, as we've already said here.
They are afraid.
And he understood that, he was changing the top.
And on the day, Tiago ...
Have you on stage?
And he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay.
Absolutely.
And he spoke with a lot of property, about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful!
I really like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
Also, having seen that the root they imagined, that Tiago had...
It was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better and he welcomed himself.
And just as he welcomed, I'll tell his story.
A lot of people!
Last week, he sent me a look at his story.
A lower saying ...
That many boys have been looking for it even more.
There's no.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story.
who wanted to share the problems they had on their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told us that.
His story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way.
That I had no shame at all.
So, tell stories to me ...
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
"So? What do you mean?
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx.
Everyone can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
Creating a lot of people to be here, right?
And it was in this place.
But if there's no rule?
We can give news about how to start, easy a question for the audience.
"Ah! I don't know
Is there something funny?
Show the picture of your children.
But actually...
I think this is not the most important thing.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof, what courage?
Fort of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of "Ave," ávio, the teacher of the university is "braica" from Jerus beyond.
He researchs listening.
We stayed for months.
Preparing his talk at TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks earlier, I'm.
From his talk.
I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this."
Every time you talk to me?
Everything tells me, it's all here.
It's all here.
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk.
About listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was listened to, when he needed the most, when he thought about his eggde, when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me.
And we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count.
There are so many addiction courses, oratory, and writing.
But who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Why did he tell me?
And we saw this today that how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we're going to change, let's change.
So we talk about change, but ...
There's always this fear.
We were an excitement, we always arrive and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And for others.
And listening?
You see, before that famous word, "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
But we...
There's no one minute.
To look at each other?
to come hug and say.
Something.
We don't have time.
Two people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
After hearing his talk, another TEDx returned, but...
MA: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most diverse, that's why I have.
I don't know, it's all the others.
"Ah! I don't know
That empathy too, I learned collectivity.
When she taught me...
Why?
We need to look yes to the problem of homeless people.
For example, when we say...
On the street.
Many of us.
We have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and tell, that make us be who we are.
And by listening, the other really.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
And he also transforms himself.
And in the midst of preparation a fight, which was this process here for me.
I was outside my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me?
All of us?
I saw from a poem I even wrote, and now you apologize me, but I'm going to read, I'd like to liberate many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
Fourth of the imperfects, the exasts.
The kitchen values bring certainties.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
I'll see them faith in life.
Faith?
In some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know.
They say they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds of non-profit, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know -
They had at least one minute of rest.
Then they could look to their side and then smile again.
To talk and to hear.
What stories will you tell about your life?
Stories, you want you to tell.
About you.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Music)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces.
It's because, in fact, I'm part of the real step.
Or you'll say, there are judgments."
Where there are all types of stars.
And the stars don't have labels or classifications.
They are belonging to their plural spaces.
There's no fat or thin, pretty ugly.
Remember the poor.
It's just a legacy of existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while.
During a very obscure phase that reflected on my life.
A phase that was denied to me.
The right to be just one.
However, resisting and existing has always been a life condition for me, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
As a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her.
The moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect.
And the right for life.
And that's why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky.
The universe is infinite.
And together, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, no one was covered or the beauty of the other.
So why are we here below?
They're small, we can't reproduce something so simple.
It's acceptance.
Empathy.
And to definitely understand that the different one agrees.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals.
So that's why we have privilege.
And it's the opportunity to be different.
Different to beauty.
It's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this wants rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you.
Permit yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
From starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball.
It was where I could be the same.
It was where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body.
Or I questioned God, "Why am I different?"
Well, the bathroom turned into my best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying.
Or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I'd only rebelde until today.
(Laughter)
But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied to me?
Or better, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different.
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it comes to the trans universe, this path is even more difficult.
I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me.
I didn't even know what trans people were.
And for my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transiting.
And that desire to grow up inside of me, I said, "Guys, I want to become a transit.
Why?
Everyone coming, so she thought and started in the wrong way.
to mirror each other.
So, during my graduation in Artescenica, I had the opportunity to meet myself, from inside.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life.
It was in theater that I learned to deal with difference, through theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my real teenage years, and I started to get rid of it.
It's as if you enter a cockle, spend some time there and leave a beautiful ballot.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everyone is stood to deal with it.
It's hard when you're in the middle of the mixture of transformations.
And you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world.
What if you are a black woman?
Right.
This path is harder.
We spent many tests daily.
In the case of us, weird, for example, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people.
It doesn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, is it that you're hostile, our new thing, there's no cross-function faces?"
No, that's it, it's going to happen.
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is it a fight here who wants to see this one and five?
While the white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills trans people?
In the whole world.
I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women.
I said that today, trans women in Brazil, we have even 14 times the chance of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
Second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016.
Thanks to 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
Being a transsexual is not an option.
But in a living condition.
There's no magic formula, there's no one - I take a little butder and a little force, resistance, expectancy of 35 years, there's no one who was still like that, that we could measure the best this panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story.
However, each one of us is the protagonist of their own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
I'm depending on ourselves, for example, I'm the living proof of it.
After I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence.
I started to use mine ...
My art as a way of deconstructing ideas, preestablished about me.
I believe in Cana on YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people, not only trans, I saw myself being a model, magazine layer, J, and Transform and Tube, and in "APsystem Carrera," I was invited to live a character for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(End of video) It's more responsibility ... (Applause) (Cheers)
It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about differences for so many people.
Representing a flag and being ugly to all that I represent alongside it.
But that's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And as much as in all the subjects that would talk about me on the internet.
They were filled with comments, as capable male.
Look, you'll never be a woman, you die.
What's no price?
(Audience) Yes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
What's no price?
This baby message from mothers.
And other trans girls.
I thank you.
To teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other girls trans with their eyes shine.
Thank you.
Because you see me there, and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be just some sad people.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond trans.
But in order to understand this, I take part in unknown, we really need to understand that we are many.
We are plurial beings, the difference is adding.
The sky?
I refuse allies' beings.
Understanding is me.
That's awesome.
Is it so blue?
Deberty without limits.
What about me and the sky?
Your and me?
Not looking anymore.
I can't stop, I've already gotten away from my corridors.
Except that they remain their scars.
that marked my soul.
Well, the future.
And the future promises.
That's what I want.
A being beside me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried, thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology.
I used to work with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
And I spent many years doing this, seeing children accompanying.
Even with all my knowledge, communication, I couldn't often explain to children what cancer was.
What is in the treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian score, that doctors called "teratoma."
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get out of tumors, you won't get a sixth grade."
Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate.
I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been established, at some point.
Nothing.
It was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure.
I woke up ten hours later, noted.
In the same village I stayed with children with cancer.
Then I looked down, full of tubes and connections.
And ...
The belly is covered.
I nurtured myself and asked, " cancer?"
She said, "Yes."
I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's out of the visitor's time."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
Even for me to sleep.
I took a while later in the room.
I used to travel with cancer, measures and committed gangs.
I'd say to the children, "Don't Google."
And after all,
It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website.
It's the only thing that ...
That was the safe information that moment I was going to die.
And it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
That sometimes I didn't help, that I wouldn't engage, and how would you engage with someone if you can't even say a word?
Full.
And I was stubborn.
And ...
To learn what bothered me, forgotten, and forth, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized.
This information from society for them to donate hair.
In fact, it wasn't for me.
They opened what it was for them.
I wasn't able to see myself as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital,
The children said, "Wow, you cut your hair off to be like us."
I said, "No, now I'm the same for you."
I got cancer.
I told you, "OK, calm, we don't take it, it's done, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling.
Over the procedures.
When I went to do...
It's to put the catheter, because I did my therapy before, the first one made a pork.
I got a hospital kit.
Here, in this kit, a sabonete came.
A base has a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
For me, this is information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did.
I'd send kids to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through this."
And what happened?
The children started to give me back their procedures.
So, they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we went on.
It was playing, but that's how we think the child doesn't understand.
And I think the child doesn't know, she knows the name of chemotherapy protocol.
The procedures, all this, sometimes parents try not to talk to protect them.
But then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls."
Then the child goes with the mother and the farmacy.
The pharmaceutic says, "The strong medicine, what will it think?"
He'll fall off his hair."
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls.
It caused cells that doubled rapidly.
But that not only the tumor cells double quickly.
As well as hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to put catheter, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have both legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running."
And there I was, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising.
I called health professionals and my creative friends, and we decided to open an NGO.
We opened BABA, called BABA, because it's cancer BAB.
What did we do?
Usually, those who make health information are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But at the end, the patient approached the patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a long time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, and with this we illustrated the most common terms.
The cancer environment.
We illustrated all this with the support of health professionals, but with something very important sometimes.
As something seems, you don't need to be explained when you like someone and you wrote, "I love you with your heart."
You draw ventricolous drawings.
I think no, so we started to do this, and with this, children started to understand more the processes.
In these terms, our first material came out, which was a guide.
This guide is distributed for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
What if there's a sponsor in the audience?
For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask, we are in more than 40 hospitals in Brazil.
The kids outside started to see, they started asking children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places.
I'd say, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator."
And the guide is very asked in the northeast, because children and parents are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do.
With that, we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
In doing several other actions, information is very important, that information sometimes isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes this information is a slope.
No kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That you need to have information about everything.
For example, I don't know if you know more, when they do events, black children earn much more present and pay attention than children.
But, sometimes, the doll child has already done the treatment, there's no cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, do you have that thing in society?
Unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if we put a poor child, drunk, sad, you'll sell a lot more, you'll raise a lot more money.
You can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't have.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, dark, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship?
Then you think, I receive calls from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but have you ever thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult, that was me, that people would look to pass through the window?
To see, your father with my life is good.
When we need help, when we need empowerment, when we need self-esteem.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
What we think is very important.
I went to the hospital to help some children.
They saved my life.
And today, all I can do is information so we can save many others.
(Applause) (Cheers) George, thank you.
(Applause)
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, that's not easy.
The dependency here gives me disease, and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, really, the answer has?
Inside us.
To treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right.
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things.
And one of these things is...
Our own organism.
This organism that has its own defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats.
One of those defenses is in our brain, it's called "barring emato in being a factory."
The matocephal barrier, despite being a complicated name.
It's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain.
And what do they do with that?
Bacteria, virus and harmful substances don't enter the brain and don't do it badly.
We, for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier.
They're very small molecules and, since they're very small, they have an almost balanced passing through the immediate barrier in being factory.
That's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed of jungles, anticorpos and various chemical strategies.
The trip to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
In this video, you can see the macrophogo in the blood stream, running after a bacterium, until it can inflate it, fagocit it and neutralize it.
Today, then.
Is that true?
We couldn't join these two things.
Trying to help our patients?
Two mechanisms of defense, which are inactive, which are ours.
(Applause)
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States...
Studying people who end up using a lot of drugs, realized that these people who used more drugs ...
To produce an anticope.
Contracts drugs itself.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
Let's go!
It's enough!
There's no need for more drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
And me and my team?
We've been researching for some years now.
In the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two.
What is it capable of sending this message to our immune system?
A message of hope.
In other words, yes.
The immune system produces anticorpos.
Other drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our body?
Did you know that our immune system produces glasses and anti-colpes are big molecules?
And then, that problem that Metcefálic barrier had to let go straight away the drug stops giving up, because when the user ...
It's consuming my drugs, this tiny molecule is linked to a big and "pum."
It's no longer on the blindest disorder.
Look at this image here how this process is beautiful.
OK?
Here, on your right, we have a while that hasn't received the vaccine.
These white dots you're seeing -
It's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Once we were able to immune them?
Here you see on your left side.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain.
Which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that went by stopped passing.
We asked ourselves, "Where did she stop, since she didn't happen?"
And it's very interesting that the rats.
vaccinated have a much greater concentration in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, showing that besides blocing the passage, it's a sharing of the molecules of radiation.
It hasn't been blood, that is, drugs get stuck in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is to receive a vaccine, they have a behavior.
They didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they stayed in the box or inhibited what doesn't happen with the rats they receive with cocain.
So, what is our group working now?
It's, in fact, to bring this solution to the market and to help people gain freedom, we believe.
And this is the treatment, the therapeutic vaccine, or the antidrogen.
Is it a treatment?
that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency.
Maybe some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
Time?
To decide.
A time to gain freedom again and ...
Discuting with themselves, if they want.
Using or not using drugs.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause) (Music)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
Interapute?
More than 40 years ago.
I want to read and say that -
Besides.
They are neurological.
Besides?
This is psychosis.
There is a disease.
It's intense.
It's a nefasta disease.
And he hurts the cloud, he loses, go.
What about me?
We call it...
I live, we.
It revealed normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
Great meeting, TEDx.
Thank you very much.
It's normal, music is being ...
Toting from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits.
Atitudes.
The set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example.
I'll give you an example.
Maybe that.
The most deadly.
"No, no.
Valor Music.
Where can I understand?
There are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
The norm.
In this is the location.
Distenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
I'd respect the fact that not always.
The norm didn't exist.
Not always.
It's shot.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times?
"What?"
We live in a context.
Where it predominates -
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dehumanity ...
In your word.
Egocentrism.
So, is it a normal being?
This adapt to a sick system?
And keep it?
I've been.
A worker?
More than 30,000 years ago.
from the International University of Paz.
Aipasse.
And people think that peace is good.
It is the absence of conflicts.
"No!"
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace ...
With the world.
The line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars?
"I said, what comes to be."
A bit of payments.
The soldier for peace.
But with other guns.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes...
The person should, that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of...
from a family shell.
When is my daughter?
Isabela.
I was five years old.
And today she has 34.
He has a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked me, "What?"
What princess do you like most?
The ballet sheet, sederela?
The golden lower?
She thought.
"You see?", he replied.
I like all the May's writing.
I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes...
Because it has to be the safety of feeling.
The skin itself.
That's it?
The contradictions...
That "normotic" don't feel them.
People who looked for me?
The panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured!
It had open doors for awareness.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's fear.
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's fear.
of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests...
being deertified?
These people say, "Madu."
I respect a lot.
Dominated people.
Cicatic and dynamic.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why in Africa ...
Are the people considered crazy?
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a "paragus" that captures.
The contradictions...
Culturate.
Sistemic.
And sometimes they don't "frag."
How did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between the ...
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing.
Where others don't know.
I said, "I'm not going to talk."
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent.
What we call ...
So ...
Musics are saints of failure.
I respect the neurons a lot, at least I have the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
What's the problem?
It's the girlfriend, we're the one who doesn't care.
Dishumanity.
So, I think.
At one point, I came to give a seminary here.
It's short, guys.
And I said, "What am I doing?"
The taxi driver?
Or knowing that I was ...
A psychotherapist told me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's silly.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
This understands.
What do I want for you?
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all of them.
Unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
(Applause)
And nothing against certainty.
At that moment, "Hi!
This offers a disajustment.
So ...
Have you spoken?
It's the girlfriend of machismo.
Of racism.
So, homofobia?
Of various?
Exclusions.
"Moramose!"
We could talk about the norm, it's environmental.
Nermosis gives it.
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything.
And the turtle salt catches the fire and each one is looking, at least, mime, mimore, and it doesn't realize.
A existence doesn't make sense.
They're ears.
An inexorable globalization, a person ...
Because, usually, the specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about...
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It makes a concept.
This education that has also been ...
I try.
A possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
In the wish it brought us.
It's an incarnation.
Who's on a stage?
We're in Rhanda.
The promise is we did.
We don't see here.
We saw a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would panded.
So ...
In foundation?
Does it give us music?
"Yes ...
It's what's fascinating.
It's another one.
Very important.
It's an evolution.
I don't know what.
Have you failed?
What do we need to do?
What differentiates?
It's a human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Yeah.
Of course.
From a snake, from a monkey?
I think of a friend, "Wow!
So, what happens?
An alternative Nobel Prize and economy?
The country in developing has remained max, nificent.
Tileno?
When I met my illness.
He told us that since he was a child...
He wanted to know where the human being was different.
And the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
One day, talking to his father -
And he really respected it.
His father says.
Isn't it stupidity, my end?
He looked at a little light, he said that he became the first aruddologist, (Laughter) a stupidology, a science we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who?
That's absolutely...
"Yes ...
Denoa, I like to remember the Lenturo River.
The creator of biodiction, a great brother?
And he told us...
Is it necessary?
What happened?
"And ...?"
The hipotalic stupid, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest Bral?
The question.
Very obeyed.
Because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's something.
Totally.
To have diplomas and universities.
Ficats.
And to do like a person talking about development?
With graphs.
They are ...
Suphisticated?
How is a person sitting?
In the branch of a tree, shaking.
"Of course."
"Nice," he also said.
And for him ...
I didn't have ...
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
What is human thesis?
And he agreed, "Aimist."
In relation to the universe.
I still have my doubts.
(Laughter)
But I need to say that I agree.
Diainistic and...
He said, "No, I don't know how to respect."
And considering what?
They are pointing out not to their characteristics.
A species, yes, of the norm.
Human beings ...
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary.
We are born to be, to flourish.
"What does it serve?"
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
What difference is our species?
For other species, it's the inacabase, it's unpleasant.
We don't.
We are born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A tartaru isn't born, it's stunned, you've ever seen and go to the sea?
We don't.
Are we inaccabated?
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or...
It's serious.
The carnivores.
It's education, it's perfect, we're imperfectable.
And it's not just about cultivating the brain.
That since the 17th century?
It seems it's just one.
To develop a rational land, no.
It's just about...
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
To develop emotional intelligence and emotional intelligence?
Unirious intelligence of dreams, learning?
To read the book at night?
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Play values of ethics.
With a heart.
I think.
Confucious.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
At 15?
I was stressed.
It's the heart.
To learn.
At 30 I raised my feet.
Fortunately on the floor.
The 40s.
I didn't suffer anymore.
Perplexity.
Or 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Do you accept it?
I used the sweet ear.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what did I wish?
Not this day, the borders ...
How about therapists and Alexandria?
They told us about 2,000 years ago.
A lot of clothes.
Five minutes.
It can be an entire existence.
to change.
How do you think?
And this is the task.
In that sense?
A nursery ...
It refers to an evolutionary estagnation.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust.
which is the greatest discovery of the 21st century.
Is it the human being?
Now, on the contrary, the question is: wake up?
21st century.
Human beings?
Nothing less than that is found without a game.
It requires everything.
The new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious, it's silent.
People don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was naturalist, he understood the natural evolution of human beings.
But the human being ...
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to orch.
AV.
Did someone ask?
God's Palma.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great life.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
Potentially.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking.
It's a story that we listen to "nonipas".
Betinho has learned us for more than 30 years.
This story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was incendiated.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flow.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I'd come back.
So resiliently, another gota.
It was in the middle of the jungle.
And I'd come back.
A patience?
The lines ...
"Thank you."
Little things.
I was in the middle of the man, "A boy, João, seeing that," said more, "The beija-flor?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
Little things?
Are you going to turn off this fire?"
Listen, isn't it?
And the challenge answers, "I know I don't."
I tell you everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
They're all very tired.
of revolutionaries.
We want to change the world, society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility ...
It's to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little ...
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions...
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe?
Considering?
I do it with others, with others.
Comundo and consistent.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
who studied these movements a lot.
Spontaneous, institutional trances, from a singing narrative.
The beija-floa!
He has no ideology, he has no flag.
He's not blaming anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of him.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part anyway.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
All of us who are necessary?
At some point you'll be here, what you're on this stage.
But on stage...
You have your life story.
Telling your story.
and taking them back ...
Your water drop.
Because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Once again, it's complaining.
In darkness.
So, I want ...
Following saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
Time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Love counts like this and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with the poem.
It's accessible.
Beautiful.
Renevant.
I went to Renato in Tedesco.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen you.
They created others.
For other visions.
Both arms that had this remote.
To be forgotten.
It's straight.
You're always the same.
Always.
More simple.
Always.
Longe.
Inside.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I entered a good school.
Let's go.
I got good grades.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
I always have to be a lawyer, an advertising or a markets.
Since my mother has a income.
I chose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
And it's good hair.
I was a multinational company that didn't recognize me by their family.
Be three in me.
She works 12 hours a day and holds up to the limit of her strength.
Stop obedient?
If I got tired, I need to be chronic.
Make interminable meetings.
Diocque will not take you somewhere.
show that you are important for the structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
It was a six likes point.
Contracting someone.
Namoro, relief, wedding.
M mini speakers.
Scale the corporate pyramid.
a shirt.
Books.
A lot of job.
Be a manager.
The firm's car.
I picked the freel in happy hour.
Happiness of time marked?
We'll have bad cuts and sapatenis.
He says, the shirt.
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years.
This is the second child.
It's listening.
(Laughter) Take the car, yes, no year.
She bought an apartment and holds 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter) Disney?
Two years later, all of seven days per Europe.
Miami, Europe, Miami.
There are more meetings that don't take anywhere.
People who are completely unqualified, being promoted before you.
Projects that start and devastate like their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
This shirt.
Creating socially every day.
The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle-truth crisis -
The meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years, went fast, is, life is short.
Children in school, my God, how to grow fast, is short life.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after week in the mountain.
We'll sell the beach apartment, children grow up and don't even want to go further.
The shirt.
The external thing is a little high, its body is flattered, like an astronaut that spent years fighting in zero gravity.
No face and, on account of the healthy habit of going through the dental lap, I place all the infections.
There's no end.
It's cold, green juice... Audience: Action!
Being a master's degree in the academia, which you used for two months, today is the fourth day of a bean.
Amburgues, after staying late, at the sign, benefit from the project, because life is too short to eat easy.
The vice-president who, despite all his efforts.
It has never arrived, it will probably never arrive.
The continuous fear of losing a job.
Today they don't value experience anymore.
The fear of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
It's continuous that prevents you from living.
Fear of death.
A good sense of suffocation: Where is the air, otherwise I'm focused.
The complete disconnection with its children decorated from the 12 hours of work field for decades.
The retirement is empty.
To be each of useless and little affection.
You're a winner, this is your only consensus.
His life is an executive?
An executive.
He sees the shirt.
From wood, for the real time.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
