They'll go.
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everything.
AC: People with and without disabilities.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress? Is there any difficulty in putting clothes, does it need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that would meet their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play, outside that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived.
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
It was this: making clothes and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was a fashion with other disabled women, and I made her a lady with a very high cause, elastic in her seat to make greater comfort, and made a discreet to make her exchange for the son, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other uncle, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a blouse opening on her shoulders, with a pressure button, to facilitate, when she passes her head, in fact, for people who are quadriplegic, who give autonomy, so that she can dress alone.
AC: In this last fashion that I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a seat.
I've already done her in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name in a army, so she could identify that the play would be the one used during the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's Ai has ananism.
And, for women, with anism or low status, the ideal.
It's thinking of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore, in the child's children session, imagine clothes with reasons of princess and cut them off.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking lighter materials and are producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana?
(Laughter) And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their collections.
She was already in her second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first, but it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed marks, and Target also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
What about the world?
What is changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much.
What is this?
I was married with the name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
It's to generate these children, they're very proud.
My family is very grateful, these women who helped us achieve this dream, really.
And to create this family: two months ago our son was so credited, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasty and leucemia.
And this puts life at risk.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel.
Like a fear of losing our child.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
Following us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep searching for an optical mood to think.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured was very incredible, because all the school's most friends, made a very big movement, sharing the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, giving medication, very incredible, was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another concrete, through this disease, gave us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was ...
And when a child has leukemia and is at risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
And that's what we learned to be this lesson and spread to our friends, to the school's more, to societies, people on Facebook.
And speaking is true, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this public disease and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's not a family that loves, that embraces each other, that's the same as all these families, because it's not deep.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
(Laughter) The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, or a living father, or a father of a mother divorced warrior, or important, I love my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trancheno passed through this disease to the world.
It's that my blood, my blood pressure, was me manufacturing it.
CF: Our favour.
The blood only goes crazy, I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so he raised that consciousness, that we have this ability.
(Laughter) To give blood to what needs.
For someone who has a house, no blood, he needs blood in his leaves.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is processing and need, and delivering oil medication, if each foreign as the donor of wax or the chance of compatibility.
Between a patient's donor, it's about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you win the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I caught myself ♪ Oh, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to be able to save in life, if me, more strength, without pain, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that the tancreto passes us all.
I thank you all.
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
Be like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Pala-La del Chinaud.
Her Syrian was born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
In January, I studied at Damás University.
Today, I am a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Araly is a little ...
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
VV: Today.
And I'll talk about what bothers me the most: "Brocrancetto," that exists about Slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap, and easy to live with the population.
One was of 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew of this child, three clothes stores, auscultory, engineering, two apartments.
It's a car in Damás.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
I loved to know the world, went to countries.
AC: Like the United States.
Narrator: Spider.
AC: It's France.
Until one day the war started on March 15.
In 2011.
(Laughter) Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
From the country, my city of the mask was the safer of Syria, had between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
Like Tipoi!
I'm five years of war.
My country is this one, it destroys.
What do you see?
Who I know were, thank you.
Carrigar or left of their children, they found their voices.
Waiting and mutilated.
I cry, a bomb.
Familiares.
So you'll admire and don't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did I go out to work?
My family would come again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have left everything, they're dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we bars and our lives remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
Babrotege my family, I went to Bahirut.
Later.
Ten months.
It's about how Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian, so I went to talk in Brazilian bars and deserted.
that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil because there were more opportunities.
And you saw Pinas, or more week, bragging Brastrada.
At 40.
From my life?
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
Orial is 11 years old.
I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, my children's birthday and everyone talked very well.
And I "abrovity."
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
and make food to sell.
That's when I created the Facebook "Hotalade" page with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has a pen and paper.
In other words, a number ... (Laughter)
And I make food in betweengo.
MB: Even good Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, thank you.
The reception of the Brazilian people.
AG: You.
They opened the pôs.
When the world was closed.
Great.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
And I said, "Torist."
Many people.
I had a wrong idea.
Over the Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
And then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
The contact with a person, a submane.
A lot!
That I Islam loves blood.
that is allowed to kill the name of religion.
AC: But exactly the eggs.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not French supplies, but also whiten.
The Syrian, the Islamic State, is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image.
A basic religion, or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since a person kills without killing all men and who reads life.
How does life lead to all men to the courtyard in their life, to the berçopolo, 30 dollars?
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even with religious culture differences.
When people see a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that brings hair, just like my wife, they ask questions like, "Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use it?"
And Silinson, at home too, Alenter Jabi, today read other roofs.
Men and women can't touch each other, and beat, just see, they are these rules, but I've already seen some humans who do all this, exhibited the voices of wedding, who kiss, hugg, and kiss.
When I left blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner, this isn't happening with me.
Why?
Because these things are made of isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing the guilty, after the Exibian Agency.
People always understand "respect" or "Profeita Mohamadez" that we must respect all religions, that all people have the same value that we must have with everyone.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black, or Indians, or that we should help the people who need, every year we have Elsaacá and we give two dots, five percent.
All of our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Cristated, today I gave.
And I invite you to learn more.
About Islam.
I'm sure it was something difficult.
Now it's understanding what a religion of people is.
Now, my dream...
In Brazil, the world knows the best "sclave."
(English)
VR: With "O," "right."
And so, my children.
And your child?
"Go to the power!"
Creating, together in base.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my tears, I make food, in the naked sun in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the loans of those who always expect to reach, those who always believe there, study the girl, what they say to me, "I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity of service, there's a lot, a cooker."
Fascinira.
Why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand, if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, he gave me an opportunity, and the mother told me, "You follow this corridor, you'll right, turn on the left, enter that little side, that the vessor is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and, since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was on vacation house, due to daily rush, sometimes not time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life, and I was painted there in the sofa, remembering all I achieved: my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach, almost in front of me.
And remembering all that I achieved, some memories also came from when I was a maid for seven years, and, as I use Facebook, as the newspaper, I put everything that happens, I remember, some reports, I'll start betting it on Facebook, and then I'll keep following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For my surprise, in less than 24 hours, this went viral very fast, and soon after that I put my first story: my first internet story was a reference to my last job as a maid in the city of Santo.
In 2009, I was hired to be a cook, I had to bring the yellows, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
What was the bathroom for houses?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionated this first story on the Internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not of today's stories.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
What I was really surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, that all of them break up and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestic work there are more valued, they earn for an hour, so completely different here in our country, for example, an announcement I read.
PL: It was for the worker.
And to work in second, access.
As soon as I got home, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but even today, books have cost a lot, and my mother, domestic, going through these conditions, still today, earning 380 Brazilian reais per day, in a single house where I found something I call humanitarian treatment, which is Regina entering the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts in 2009, when I got to the university, I got to read at the university too, and when I knew the experiences I had experienced last year, in 2009, it was very difficult.
And to raise awareness in the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the rug of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, Black woman like me, and I expose some stories.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I've come here to generate adversity."
(Laughter) Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, why?
And the vast majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% according to 10 of 2013, they are black women.
What about that?
AC: It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women, because I say that when serving an author, my grandmother was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I didn't understand, but she knew that everything she'd been through, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
AC: Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least an interview, take a suspicion, after graduation, take a suspense, to see my experiences, to have established that, that, and so on, and that's you?
(Laughter) Yes, or I'm magic.
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant past, it's coming from us, it's the domestic employees today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door, my pattern came."
And then, when I get there, already with the clothes of leaving, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was so strange, ours, I forgot to take your money, Monday, I pay you."
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother was always going to work, and there wasn't much time for her, but all the needs she was going through and suffering was me who was there.
I only wanted to see, she got married, that's it, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to the wedding, but, as I'm lazy, I put my best clothes, I went to the church, I was hidden, and I went to see my girl getting married.
Because the modern coast is the maid's say, "It's Christmas, I'm seeing my boss's family having fun, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
The worst moment in my life is when my boss will work, he'll work, he'll take him...
His wife at work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
To the house.
To hide me.
The only solution I had was to remove copies from all over the world.
So, if I clean the bedroom, I get traffic.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his harassment because when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, do you get 1,800 reais per month?"
I'll never gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
I just arrived at a new service.
And I brought my little glass pot.
Because my deaf pot is my Pinico.
I was there.
And, in this area of service, tired, I got my little soup.
And it did this in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the owner's gate and the bathroom, and there was no room for the employee's bathroom so I brought little?"
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's money, today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people, in my place, would be there in the faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
Menine, you have to be happy where you are.
To pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but her mother wasn't a domestic, she was already predestined for her family to serve.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
(Laughter)
Hi, my father.
I'm a holiday!
(Applause) Black woman, bubble, peripherical and rack teacher ... next to me.
I'm not alone here, dared.
(Laughter) Yesterday and a half are six million households that should only be by my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do, I would run that my life doesn't think of money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
Because in other countries, various domestications work and study, and here, this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, but it's not to be clear which places some people are in this country.
So I'm here to control the statistics.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million houses.
Anyone I thought African and not forced.
Who taught you to swim?
Invisible, the air in the wind.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny to go out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Turn off your cell phone.
Don't photograph, because I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
And then I was doing the octave, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
They look at the agenda, see their eye, and it's insecurity, put equipment.
I open inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
And this chaos, this situation?
I remembered an author's quote.
He used to say, "This is the entrance door to a present state.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Within this feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you are not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're your human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's a course.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a great nest.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced.
I was determining how I thought, the way I act, was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just stood the man.
Several of you.
Did you think?
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I'd really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone and ask because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
And turn it off.
You connect, come this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor.
And then, behind you, close your computer.
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It stern of connection: who connects with the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look at me, look at the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
And you're fine, you won even a veil.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born of fear.
In anybody's man, it's not that guy in front of you, until this guy, right now, is with much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
And a good space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
And from the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
Is it a strong sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
(Laughter) You know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, right now, a different part of your mind is caring.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were kids, you took your hand to hot chicken chicken and then you learned that a little before your hand, you could play a chicken?
(Laughter) You sat the temperature and took your fingers to Chica's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
Since it's new, equality, it's new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
The city tells that much of what we do is determined by what we've already lived.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
A habit in our lives are self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them, so available, are simple.
But they're the last generation technology.
We already know that communication will be the evolution of race, the direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video.
(Laughter) And normally it's my first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so sedutive that the idea of translated.
I had a demand for a TEDx fan region.
What did you ask for behind the recipes?
(Laughter) It's time shared with your friends, your colleagues, your family.
(Video) In the case of your Brazil.
The translation work is fundamental once it's worth it.
Five percent of people already remember the term "prodiscity."
Five percent of them have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
translating to 16,16 languages and almost 6,000 translations made today.
(Laughter) But we not only translate.
We also transcribe the talks made in events like these here.
The transcession work is important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow people with hearing impairment, to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk isn't given in English, as it's my case that creates Portuguese, first it's transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified to my time and in English, it's that it's translated to learn more language.
Because, initially?
TEDx talks with its own logotype indicates: "We put up topics with technology than rooting, "intrutinely," which is the "e" that we can translate as entertainment, and design to the stage referred, currently the talks approach an infelity of subjects that go from this environment.
And another of my passions.
Finding what follows the topic is this event with the mind.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
And as well as the reduction of the human work journey throughout people.
I think the shoe that one of the uses I make of my hearing receip is to translate, perform and transcribe as a pride, talks in the TEDx's environment.
The TV shows are short educational eyes that can be the "tertox" stone, can be the TEDx stones, accessible even children in a small child.
And I do this, not only.
(Laughter) Because translating is a passion and passion is a strange word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," that is, a "sedex," that is, a pretty anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the trouble that Trantor is a privileged mentor, not only that helps me deal with the magazines with me and with the treatments.
But not only because I had so fantastic people, as I know at this event.
inspiring people.
(Laughter) But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent.
(Laughter) In initiatives like this one.
What do I want?
Second, the philosopher, "Eddy Frome?"
Tell the men's lesson in life.
Audience: Yes.
(Video) It gives light to yourself and become what is potentially, that I don't have any doubts about education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt: education is fundamental.
So that people, less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society, can live in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask for volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge, transport an object.
"Are you just a volunteer work?"
(Laughter) Because I always choose my own decision.
And I have to do the best way possible and try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
(Laughter) It's different to donate the pieces.
And we're left on our feet.
Tradition is a complex activity that takes not only to know the same foreign, the sources battle, or mainly.
MA: Our life.
GL: And João Fogos, a young student.
For tests from a very violent translation.
(Laughter) There's always a mix of knowledge that has a middle.
A lot of research.
There are many jobs.
And many hours of dedication.
And behind a fluent translation, to be ours, to see?
There's always a great worst distress.
And frustrated by failures?
For the best they can do us, they can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost in definitions.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going to the greatest.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations.
(Applause) Not only about the speaker, but about those who know it.
And to guarantee this quality all translations and transitions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally took advantage of a black color motto or a language coordinator.
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, that we arrived in Portugal, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here namely.
I said, "Stories.
We have six girls, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
I have our guys.
And that's why, in my left, Gustavo.
(Laughter) The tunnel or the sun.
What is grace?
The world is good.
This obsession I have with education ...
P: Really?
(Video) I was listening.
AC: Not only.
With Brazil, who lives a deep, political crisis, where education is released the cycle of the bread, but without the same personal history.
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
(Laughter) Despite that, I knew well how to write very well and do the four maths tests very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond because I'm studying and make some kids study.
(Laughter) That's why what was living in our neighbor called Tairobeiras.
(Laughter) He decided to move around for his four kids at the time, I paid a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
In some parts, my father had sold his start, his logic, Uberas, and his place also established, with the merchant, he learned that the material had a presence store that had in the rest.
(Applause) In traffic.
In 1964, there was a great occupation in Brazil, due to this reession, and other reasons, my father was the false, and he lost absolutely everything, and literally, without anything, that you killed in his cell phones.
One felt very humiliated his clown in my father's name, and decided after paying his troublemakers.
And if it moves to Belo Horizoni, as it's a front or behind, to eat well liked ZI.
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who is 40 today, isn't deaf?
(Laughter) Besides waiting for Paráito Games today, there.
It was an excellent cooker, who carried directly by holding my hand, and she decided to make cheese shoes to sell, when, for many years, in my house, wherever she wanted, literally, to win the grandma, say ticket in the largest pains of pedalization.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it was done.
The big one, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by Agassa, domicilios.
(Video) In the 48-year-old crossing, up to 60 years of Brazil, only 32% of people with greater solidarity than 5%.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
(Video) When I was younger days, my father, for example, had interconnected Alávidos.
At the time, when I was seven, we were already alphabetized at seven years old.
And a small cup of impairment, notebook, and asked the area, he chose a buy, and then the mayor needs to stay at home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the most spantalized in parokia, right?
But for my father, they would get me there, knocking, without knowing, they had to train a little for this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) This is what my five siblings were able to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children better conditions than those we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in the life of my public practice, it's my two kilos, Daniel, and João Enrique, whom I've never put snakes, but for whom I made a question of all the nights.
(Video) Tell stories before everything, so adventure was always a pleasure for me and four children.
Coincident that, in coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is, without a doubt, a seren.
(Laughter) At some point in the magazine.
(Laughter) And one of the brothers is the educator without a mark, for me, fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we had to be homicide by education.
Despite the adverse conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives about TEDx has to do precisely because the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was so simple, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these wonderful speakers.
TEDx inspires us.
And then, fail the idea.
What make us believe.
To think about everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and tried to teach us, but it didn't work very well, because it's supercompliated, I started to write the letters from dots on my notebook.
I ended up letting my notebook and my schedule of lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various cards that annoyed me, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet and I did many times, and I also exchanged various cards that show the relief, in which I wrote to her that I was learning, still, gave tips.
With that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in Santa Cruz, and we thought that maybe braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where it could feel the time.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and it only shaved in nothing, but it reescribed everything, disconnected and reconect everything, and it started to work, and, about a month ago, we ended the clock, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to create a smaller report or a translator in Braille, it was very moving.
The whole process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help only in inclusion, and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my best you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the paintings.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and even if we, two high school students, who haven't even finished, in high school, we're second, and we're teenagers, we're able to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help the future.
Let's ask a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
We don't care.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance commercial, is that there's a half exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the goal of mourning.
And another part with the goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know a few hundreds.
Men.
And women, who manage their business autonomously, publish their ads.
We received their clients.
In apartments, in hotels.
Or there are street thinking.
And nobody has to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve me 16 or adults that didn't make sense that their consent is crime cases.
These are cases that must be chosen, criminals and judicially.
And I said, "What? What?"
Definitors must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, forever, therefore, a storming prostitution and forgotten frustration.
I'm not here to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
Attention is the confusion of prostitution.
Through sexual exploitation, but to take all the people who do prostitution by victims of traffic action is to confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
Research has shown that Portugal the traffic phenomenon falls towards sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that can't be identified, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I've just said, that here the phenomenon isn't possible, I'm going to give you the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that teaches information about the issues related to human traffic.
And that's relatively the year 2016, the latest available data.
It indicates that 108 traffic victims were confirmed in Portugal.
Human beings.
Almost all of us for job exploitation?
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there's all an email speech.
What are unpleasant from reality?
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
It happened a lot.
It's stressed.
And that you're doing something that's waiting for someone.
I wanted the salvation well.
E: But this doesn't respond to reality either, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate to economic inequality.
Therefore, inequalities only be cultural.
We know there's a diversity of construction.
which influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the internal encounter is.
Investigator, interview, I'm with people who work sexually.
What they tell me is that this was an option, an option based after equation in advantages.
And disadvantage that it is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a despair, and it's not recognized.
AC: If I ask you to think what image comes to you right now?
The mind.
It's when you think of a person who prostitutes.
Think about it.
I bet that most of you thought of two situations, or any other one, or a woman.
That's why I'm not scared.
Because, from lombrics, who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, which is very likely batoxic in a relent and who, of course, there's some supported person, but this is only two stereotypes, these are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor.
In other words, reality.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences.
And these life paths are not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not just cigarette women, there are also many transgender women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are powerful and flaws.
And society identifies itself.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
It's called Sindroe.
What will you present?
We are only about 10 to 20% of the total population of prostitution.
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
(Laughter) They're Ministers, but they're not neglected.
Let's study it.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by preservation of days from the University of Lisboa, and interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of the street, as in the context of the inside, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10 addictions to 2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
They forget it's a percentage of men who are here.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to tell you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
And even though it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work.
And this is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
Prohibited, selling sex, but it's crime buying sex.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's that people in prostitution are victims.
With no exception, and so, if they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other thinks, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has spoken a remote about the great success this law and how it decreased prostitution.
But there are very strong evidence, namely, non- environnemental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they indicate that this law puts more stream.
That's why sex seedors themselves put rich for sex taste.
And that increases their vulnerability, violence.
There's stigma and disease.
Another idea we have is that everyone.
That this idea of all people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
Mmm ...
It's an idea, without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, people's speeches.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea I think is ideologically biased.
Even because research has shown that the lessons between workers of their sex and clients.
These are complex relationships and, mainly, we are abusive relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is unpleasant.
who are the people.
Because they are disabled people or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that directs sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can make them travel to the 21st century professionals.
Even country?
What has the Hongal figure, who is assistant, sexual, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual donations with people who are disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about the relevance of sexual work and who already destroys any moment that tries to be the favour of the customers' criminalization.
Ah, then, if people...
You can do this as an option.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done with you.
Control to work connections if this can be done without more explanation than in another job activity, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically sexual moral, which divides sexuality into two types to the side having a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" and consider them legitimate.
In other words, anormal, anti-natural and that's where the start of the sky is located.
And the fact that the beginning of being considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, social rejection, of decreidibilization, of disvalorization of people who do this activity.
stigma is a mark with iron a profound delivery.
The stigma that rejects sex observators is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
What is at the base of so much discrimination about sexual observers, like, for example.
It's when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, there's no 'dexibas', a puta stigma.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The biggest offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and disabled people, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of spada of glasses that's above any of us.
Any woman knows that, if there's a sexual behavior that's disappointed, norms that reads socially, it's horrible.
The duty of being required by a puta stigma.
Because any woman knows how to step at risk.
It can be called puta.
It's so little.
Why do I think we can do any of us?
(Laughter) So that they don't continue to disrespect sex players.
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
To challenge the stigma, which I'm here to do right now, and to give voice, to listen to sex workers.
It's giving voice to a group that has been.
It was one of the most attempted attempts of silence over time.
The model of the century.
So, all over the world, organized and used 70 but, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility, they are not heard.
(Laughter) We don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to go on.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense?
What is natural that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is crazy.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Art, well cure art, cure the doctor.
It is supported by a fundamental stone in thepassed medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so I can propose the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships of our time, with all more superficial and more reasons: I was this balance, it's suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors were also there in various pain.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
I was a white evil, I thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear India, India told me this.
Besides jumping, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have since my childhood, to relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that love, that care.
He extrapolates.
Audience: Yes.
I used this convention, the request to "dar" and I was.
Or schedules, or schedules.
All the doctors who go with us and focus on that.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another field practice here.
The simplification that's going can be replicated here too, is the oppic that you don't need to go to the middle of the Amazon, which is all this, it was the path I found to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university, if you make a list of topics of students' goals, the first goals are there.
Altruism went well.
Of those same students, in the medicine symbol, with the same research, the topics of the statement: success, recognition, healing.
Something we did is wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant stigma.
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
That's it.
The action?
And the Belgian relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back from the past, in Greece.
Because it's the weight in medicine, where the father, the medicine, which is the time.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't done.
(Video) When Dan, in Gasboa, Maçã, Eva disgastated him, this was to do a pervious trip, that's what we do until January hasn't touched the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father in medicine, why for the first time?
He had a method.
You can.
Sound art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And in a way that the involvement of these people had a store.
At that time too, it was developed and created a grandma's isolation.
Because, until nowadays, it's used in the medicine graduation in the world.
It was a status of 50 years of crisis.
I'm in a photo, OK?
These are slightly complex words, you prepare three words.
In all houses, they entered.
She said, "It's just to see the building of the patients."
Listening to all the volunteer and corruption damage, especially the seduction of women, men, children and surroundings.
That's why you've heard respectfully the life of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
And if I respect this jury, I didn't hear it there.
It would be the right to go for a reputation between men all the time, and if the violin goes through the opposite, why, already in the collection, worry about it, and even today, do you do the dyn?
Because the more patient's relationship is essential for a good cure, so it's.
Today, few things are taken by July of honor, and, in this case, I've seen a honor of taking part in a profession which is taken for a judgment of honor.
Medical knowledge in Greece is an individual.
To produce science in a way that our fellow man could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a medical team that takes care of a group, and each of us is taking care of a little bit of this, we're going to specialize a lot, addressed this and losing the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk to the patient, you can't, no.
Once I was in a classroom in college, in the classroom of small groups, as a teacher, and ...
I played with Spanish processes, patients with aography, resonance, and how they copy our illustration.
No, I'll look for their belly, I didn't make them at home.
(Laughter) "Oh, I took our composition, the guy called me a little, called my whole class and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
But isn't it?
I had to tab as the patient's green, that smoked what was smoking inside and it didn't smoke anymore, but it showed that he had emagreira.
Mans on Earth.
It's luxury and pain you can see if it's building care.
That's it.
I touch the suck, you can talk a lot, when you're moving at the patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he has, if he can remember something he didn't tell you in the office, and said, "If all this doesn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally for him, to be careful with him, that you're wearing black people, that you want to do good for him, that you're asking for good, they're for him, let them take care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, they improve faster and have a more precocely ralk.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no anitâneas change, no X-rays, you can't see anything, diseases have symptoms.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already got up at Frasti Boop.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's average relationship, but to be a drug dealer, I'm patient and to be passive to those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
Because, after all, relationship actors are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two aires.
And there are doctors and bills donate.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we have to hold our hands, that was in our cure process, but also in developing their cure process, in decisions, their cure process.
To do this.
The first point, the most important, is information.
It's not enough to be in a talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had an ex-called size in my house, medicine and health, there's a reading book of health, and that's always existed, the difference that, in that occasion, to talk, today, Google, you have an infinity of good and very important information, but, much with this, and we need to know first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they allow me not to do this bad, because it puts me, just like other people who are defending personal interests, either profit or red or other things.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: don't believe in good things to be freezing, the information run, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing you found today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my most when I don't know: dumb.
Think, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry isn't interested if you know this, you get it, nobody dominates the information.
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me, they weren't the president of the hand, and finally.
Take the information, discuss your doctor, it was for that.
The information isn't the same as knowledge, takes information, participate in your cure, information is information, knowledge, but disculp your cost.
Secondly important thing to be active at the Cura Nation is to ask, to demand to know, when you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine works.
If you have the right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to answer me," I work 20 years, so.
I know there's some time, but I don't think that's going to change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture of...
And to exist, it's not to get there fighting with everyone, not body teachers, it's not that.
(Laughter) Strangely, you know?
And there is: if we compost with time, we go.
And to make atendments different.
Doctors want that.
They want the right land.
They don't want to have this attempt, like, "No time," they want to take care of the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, Parémontonhosis, the area was a friend, that we had a patient there, that he had skin cancer.
It's that with humor.
NJ: In our finger.
And there was no orology to bring it to São Paulo, to be treated here at the Cancro Institute.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his translator, he was one of them, he didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, had a translator, he was the son of the destiny who spoke very little Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was really fortunate, and I presented a consultation that, for me, would give a scene from a film.
The orometric index, you like this.
Isn't it?
Oops.
The doctor went.
Very well.
(Audience) Yes.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had everything to be careful about it.
This magic that wants the art of well-being, so it doesn't need to talk a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors taking care of teachers who are anonymous, few, in ambulants, and in office.
Doing.
Or by throwing your aluna hand, healing?
He's taking care.
So, we, elderly.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment, more compassion, and all patients.
Try to be active in your cure process, which is not to do, because there's a connection, and the world has better, and you'll be invented because of poverty.
People.
I'd like to start with the world here: 3,500.
What happens to have this money?
AC: This number is the number of decisions that human beings make every day.
And it makes more or less a decision every two seconds.
And the person, both, splits themselves to make a decision for those who interpret the person and speak.
The value of decisions I want to tell you about, with a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my grandmother to make decisions.
The murders of the magazine had three emotions in this nature.
AC: A digital nature with 59 dollars.
A printed magazine structure, Servinho Ciculares, which is a literature that is a little digitally printed to also be a winner.
The reasoning of this experiment is that the majority of people chose as you are principal.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups.
For the second group, it was only the exhibition of the two options.
GB: A digital option, 50 workers.
GG: And evolution of how José do Victores too.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I tell myself about these experiments, I wanted to think that this notion of the means of entrepreneurs is a printed notion.
What did nobody choose?
What did this option change, most people chose the new one?
And that left me very unpleasant.
Why would I want to overcome and make this decision?
I started to study about it, I studied a lot about it, and I discovered that this person came to the name.
She replied.
It's a position that's placed in an equation to influence this Dr. They make a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Computamental Economy, for the theory that studies cognitive School and neuroscience applied the decision-making.
I won a formula like this, interesting, you got there.
AA: But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the option T.
In other words, you've already met the same look at the occupation, "It's just that you're the middle of it, do your name to be better, for what I'll always pay for 22 years."
AC: Our company, if I can have two for the same.
This is impressive because I started to ask myself why it's all about it.
And a talk that even from TED made me understand everything: it was a talk he made a comparison.
These behaviors with them before today.
I think everyone looks like their role in the airplane.
The circle of their users seems a little greater than I follow in blue all year, do you agree?
Because I have around me, it seems we can see it differently, the truth is the mission of my size.
But we see it differently, because I'm around influencers, "There is another optical illusion that I was fascinated by coming, which is this one here."
The pieces of needing chess up.
They are equal to chess and lower pieces.
(Video) Narrator: It's the same time that will do your problem before arriving at all this.
But I'll show you that it's the same.
Without staying in the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
When I saw this presentation, it's the best time I understood it makes some sense to say it's around us, it's the same way as what's around us, we have to influence the way we see things.
What's around the reserve is the means of all the decisions.
Travel doesn't have technology.
I didn't know where to avoid working in a project to create an application through insurance.
He said, "If we want to be happy."
It's a lot of option and life won't be explored.
You can choose this illusion of dreams, these three or these two.
And he won't be old, insecure.
Because we were working and they said that 500 km of possibilities of choice.
The team I was working ended up supposing a way of meaninging this choice to people, this way it was made in another profession, if the person was all the time, she had these three options.
If the person boosts in half chronic media, he sees these three donations.
It was then fighting for them to be concepts of the Forbes magazine.
(Laughter) I ended up realizing that there are people.
What makes the drawing of architecture of decisions, today I'm walking in decisions.
In the world of technology, there's even the name for this profession, called YO Ex, and this called me a lot of version, the architects of the decisions, work to pass the architecture of the decision, designing all forms and environments in the region of all the decisions.
Why did I stop this name, mine, if today he found a day with this father, this RL's face is the person who's a burden in this subject of behavioral economy, and he said, "Look, I found here at UFRJ, and take it with the Airle Denary."
What really changed my renovation of seeing is behavior.
But she came to a research to know that we use a lot the cell phone, that everyone would have a third class, a pocket, or outside the pocket, look at him, she thinks we don't need any research.
AC: If you need to have some pieces of people who have a smartphone, they have smartphones for 22 hours standing up.
He decides to lose you and you get them with Helen Moore.
So, in those 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think they are digital decisions?
Initials established these rhythm and metal patterns that enabled stories to be found in the world.
I started to ask myself about this.
What makes the button and that horizon come from a person, comes into the hand of this decision as I am?
Will everybody change the success of the path we will take, will the child start to act and not be the success that William's name be?
AC: And how are these decisions from him, shouting power?
For me to need it, I took the "nos," it's the web, it's Google.
It needs identity.
Speaking of "Ay Doubli," I should talk to you about another interesting number: it's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata, it's 4%; the UFRJ poison, which was this and said, "ON shouldn't be free."
I don't know.
(Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two players.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Austria have 99% of young donors, what in Austria is you already a gay donor?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a magic word called "defol."
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call the "capitão de nascimento," "You need to get out."
Someone is already far from the drawing that you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my cell phone these days, and there are two options: one survived the reels.
And another question of CB offered.
The Greeks were dismantled, the offers were killing.
So, someone decided I wanted Férgica, I didn't want to receive it, so I went there and went out.
What to get out disappeared from the offer and came out of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people, I opened Uber, was in a bitter to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave if I was really in the people and up to now.
I thought it was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver, I don't know if you get the work they love to talk about.
And then, a truck from Uber once tells me a story.
And a lady chose PUC.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "OK, there's another passenger, man?"
He looked at her and said, "This is, he chose the cube."
(Laughter) And she said, "I cut the guy, right?"
So Barcelona was going to choose the business without even knowing.
She chose what was already chosen by her.
MA: Is it?
This is very complicated, it's very interesting to imagine whoever makes these decisions.
AC: If we go to Google today, we need to eat as a person today, it has 567 thousand results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from people was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I'm there and I click on peace to be born.
I love the page seven, and I see there what is the page: "I'm on the website."
So I ask you to think.
AC: Actually, that's Google, it's Uber giving us little pills.
AC: These little sounds, in English, have a name in the behavior economy, they also have a name, they are called "innants."
It's not exactly a little push in English. I want to ask you to study a little push to the person next to you, yes, don't notice the board to have (Laughter) only an ecology, beauty, there's an excellent thing, there's a theory.
AR: From an author called "Britateler," he has a book called Nães.
And the concept of "digitive" is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these emphas in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "Now I understood myself, I thought, "I want to walk.
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a photo of my important view.
AC: You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Detina Mar.
AC: Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
In the midst that a text written, "I want to apply to a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you'll make in your life."
(Laughter) Luis Pica, me.
The fact that you don't want to give up is easy to stay in that link and ask to leave.
And how many people criticized the book?
In other words, more than 400 inscribed people.
(Laughter) Three people stayed together.
(Laughter) So, that means that I use all the decisions of the life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, that was just an experiment, according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I motorize the results.
I encourage people to ask me:
Do you have this knowledge of these discomforts?
Of those grades.
And this can do because we manipulate someone?
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to make someone buy something that they don't need, or you can use good things, like, for example, it's just right at the moment, it's so insulin.
Or you can use to record truck accidents, like this bonet, the same autochem, which makes the metal wave to detect a kilogram to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
AC: There's an event that happened in 2016, that made people around the world leave 144 billion steps.
What do you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
What do I believe?
Who is trying to understand better?
How do these little cards work, how do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
We were able to be more aware that we made better decisions, thanks.
