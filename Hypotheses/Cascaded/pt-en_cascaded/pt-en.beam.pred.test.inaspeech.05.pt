Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or should I have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist?
Is it to create a college degree?
that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009.
When I was still in search of a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
Do you have a college entrance exam?
For wheelchairs.
So I talked.
With various women, including parapletas that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times, they would buy a clothes:
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewel to do some adds?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
Now that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
That was it.
to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I did it.
A square with a very high cause, elastic of the blindness to make more comfort.
I made a discreet to make the exchange of the probe that is very used by those who use wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no compound to not form downstairs, which are injured by the actress of the skin with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I did it for Carlena.
A light is that it was open in the shoulders.
A warm of button of pressure.
To make it easier when you pass your head.
In fact.
There are people who are quadriplegic, the ideal.
It's thinking of a dress that facilitates who's going to dress the person.
And for paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
In ergonomics, I've already done it in the sitting position.
to make more comfort.
For Jesel, a visually impaired person.
I made a dress that she could use in many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name remembering him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in armile, so people could have access to some basic information.
Like the size and color of the play.
Hi of Kelle, training.
For women, with anthism or low stature?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
My excitement in this work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there is.
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news ...
It's that businesses are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products.
As colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped Prots.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion competition, including the world, which is already in the best edition.
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
which are the big companies.
Special and conceptual marks that realized the real need of this dressed room.
They are already launching collections, like the Americans take.
And she was already in her second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal.
Our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Listening of four years old.
Until adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community is starting to work with the record.
I was conscientizing people, "How?
Putting trash, knowing how to separate one trash from another.
So I tried to talk to children and it was making awareness of their parents.
(Laughter) The parents who were catching me off the children.
People recognize me in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I do with the children I know.
In my community?
We have one.
A seed collection when you go to the forest?
I'll work with SAF.
We have a plant.
Once I met a plant called Hengar's name, she's a legominous plant.
And we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I had.
While below it, we have a good result.
In our community?
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
That all plants!
It was used every one of its place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
So, you have to imitate forest, why?
There in the arm.
Was there a lot?
It's a plague that was giving plants.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So, I tried to plant them.
Sharing: I have a hoax, a culpo, label, Andiróba, Copaiba.
With Maru, Araná.
And it's all there, there's no plague.
We come there.
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside?
Cicomparation of ours.
In our community, we worked all with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural.
There's no tox in our community, OK?
(Laughter)
Do you just see the human being?
Like an animal.
The child, I compare her and count only to pay, you talk, she's there listening and passing me to other children.
I'm paying and I'm coming to this attention."
Then he begins to talk to another animal, so I compare the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection.
"Mom, I care for those kids."
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all in the desire, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person.
What observes my house?
I kept observing my house and ... (Audience) I kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things leave us there, everything is fine.
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, had a future.
And it's to work out.
And today we have ...
Is it a job inside?
"It's far from the atom."
"When I'm going to take?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children: for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tartaruga of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river, what was it before?
They had a hooligan.
In front.
That's how it's a little bit like our community.
And ...
This hooligan didn't drive.
He ended with the saw.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
Let's move on to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
A forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel it?
It's typical.
They breathe the pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest.
It's always being talking to people teaching children.
"And ...?"
Moving on to other people.
And I have a message to leave here.
A very small phrase?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and approach us.
There, we're talking, practicing people.
And I'm very happy.
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely thank you, guys.
I'm gay.
In contrast with the name, I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us, Plana California.
I wish these children, they're very proud.
From my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this reality dream.
What would this woman be?
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
And that ...
It puts life at risk.
Imagine all the more and parents who are here, as we feel.
It's like a fear that has lost our child.
And we would be two options.
to collapse, to cry, or...
Resolver, fight.
Believing, faith, strength and continuing looking for an ugly melody to get there.
For them, being able to make a subway transplant, which is what they need to be cured.
What about it?
It was incredible because all the school's most friends did a very big movement, sharing the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, calling "mul," very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
What when?
A child has leukemia.
And there's risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns.
It doesn't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
This is what we learn to be this lesson.
And it spread to our friends, to the most of the school, to societies, people on Facebook, telling the truth, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this disease, as public as well, and all this movement found a donor.
It was.
What about people?
They saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that is equal to all these families.
At the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a divorced mother, a warrior.
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease for the world?
And what?
Not even the blood, nor the strawberry.
We can make them.
Our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human being can give to another human.
He raised such a big awareness.
We have this ability.
To give blood to what needs, and blood isn't only ...
For someone who has hunger, I don't go out.
The blood is needed in the pairs.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everyone is processing and they need.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's one ...
About 100,000 people, so if you ...
I'll unleash a life, it's as if it were winning the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when he moves three.
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be able to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life, without me, more strength, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that ...
Or so credit?
It doesn't happen to all of us, I thank you all.
By supporting us, by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
She adapted to me.
You looked at it.
Please be like you.
This is exalition.
That's not it.
My name is...
The word is "tinau."
I'm serious.
I was born in Damasco.
Capited from Syria.
I, an engineer.
I studied at Damasco University.
Today ...
I'm delighted.
It's not Brazil.
with my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little crazy.
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today.
I'll talk about this.
What bothers me the most.
"Broken sexto."
Well, there's Slon about it.
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with this one.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was 20x.
Three million kisses.
Isn't it?
My family.
My friends I knew as a child.
Three that two are already cut down.
Engineering men.
Two apartments.
I, a car.
Intachca.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Foli.
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day ...
The war began.
March 15.
It was in 2011.
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
From the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had delivered: Vinci.
It's 25.
There you go.
Origia.
How good!
In five years of war.
This is my country.
It's a hero.
People: whom I know were forced to carry on.
Or Cadaba.
Of your children.
They found their voices.
Vert and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiares.
I'm Miram.
And they didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
I didn't know if it's going back home.
"When leaving, hug working?"
I knew how to come to my family again.
Or not.
Today ...
Millions of Syrian lost everything.
They were dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I.
We were very sad.
When should we leave Syria?
Today, our hopes and our lives remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still live there.
I don't know if I'm going to come.
They, again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
Well, ten months.
Obviously, Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
"So?"
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad.
And they said that São Paulo ...
It was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
And TEDxApinas.
Or one week, to leave bridges.
Fifty years of my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and he was.
With a lot, today I have a daughter.
Brazil is the queen.
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party for me to live, my children's birthday, and they all said very well.
The food that my good thirds told me ...
I'll take advantage of what the kitchen is.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
Hi, that I created "Dagine on Facebook" or "Talade with my desiry," that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper.
A number is... (Laughter) And the well-being eating Syrian foods.
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world is.
It was closed.
For us.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
Two chorists.
Many people had a wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
Or contact?
As a homosexual.
A human being.
A lot!
That Islam loves blood.
which is to be allowed to tolerate the name of religion.
But exactly ...
The diving.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us.
The Syrian.
The Islamic State is an organization.
Torreists who are pushing Islam's image.
A religion.
What's based on?
Alcurão.
I'm not a book.
It's sacred since a person kills.
Without she had killed another, or semiated, with option, a land, and how all men killed and who read of life, it will be like deceiving life to the courtyard, her life, to the bercebolo, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill, humans, Sonita.
How am I?
My life in Brazil -
It showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When people see a woman using "hijabi"?
That handkerchief that covered my hair, just like my wife, was my wife.
You ask questions, how?
Why do you use this handkerchief?
With that heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
(English) "Aline de Reijabi."
Today, read other rules.
Men and women.
I won't even get touched."
To start.
Yeah!
Excess are of wedding voices.
Some people told me.
But I've seen some humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Look, Tao islam has these rules, more.
It's from each person wanting to buy or not?
"Poblata well," "browib," some things to be.
The same way they have grown up that they don't obey everything.
It's not good for having killed as fat cane and alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Let's do it.
With more than a partner.
This isn't happening with me.
Why?
Because these things are proved by Islam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing Moislam, then.
Because the agency always explains people.
Understand.
It's respect.
Or "Professor, Mohamat Dess."
And we must respect all religions.
Because everyone has the same value.
That we should have!
Right?
With all of us.
It doesn't matter if you scream white, black, or Indians.
Oislam also says.
that we should help the people who need it.
Every year we take Alsaka and we give it...
Two points, five, for a moment.
All our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Chrystalos, today I gave.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
What it was like to understand is a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
To finish.
with "Oubrecent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children.
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is the moleque?
In the little histories of life.
I come to recite my tears.
In the emerging sun in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up to the saints of whom?
Hopefully, achieved.
Who always believes cancer?
I don't even believe.
I lose hope.
But, in the daily cave, I know who suffers.
Lavulça do food, my salary ends, just like this race.
A girl, a girl, was what she told me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Fascinira.
What didn't hire me in the mall?
I don't understand, this makes me so much to pay a Secretary course.
But it doesn't even enter the office.
Excuse me, as there was an event among you.
I clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
The ME is CTI, to be a maid.
If it were for option, I have several friends who are in these situations already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas, please, mice, it gave me an opportunity.
And the teacher told me.
You follow this corridor.
It goes straight, turns on the left, enter that little side that the vassor is waiting, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011.
And I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, "I'm a maid."
The page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and this year, it wasn't even completed four months yet.
And since I wanted this page, it wasn't programmed, I was at home.
Differences.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
And I was said there in the couch remembering all that I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach's topic, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook?
Or the newspaper?
I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, a girl, everything you can do.
Yes, mother, it's my new day.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
Because I was a maid for seven years.
I warned people, "Look, guys.
I remembered some stories I'll start.
Post this on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid, so that, in case, other people have gone through this too, compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
To my surprise.
In less than 24 hours, this went viral very wrong.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first narrative on the Internet was referred to my last job as a maid in the city of Santos, this in 2009.
Yes, I was hired to be a cook?
And my boss prevented me from ...
My diet is the food I made.
I had to bring the yellows, I couldn't use the cup.
In her house and neither the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared it.
This first story on the Internet went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
What I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories and not today's stories.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media.
It must be from London, the German TV Dábio and several times.
What did I get super surprised?
When I talked to these reporters, I saw Skype as everyone.
Everyone!
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil.
Then he got the reward and I started talking.
From these stories, because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
domestications are more valued, they earn.
For hour, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive many abusive advertisements in my page.
It gives employment announces that I've tried as abuse announces, for example.
The advertisement I read.
It was for the worker.
It's ... going to work in the second one.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, per month.
3180 reals per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions, today, there are domestications being prevented from feeding, and they also don't earn food, there are domestications, but in only one house, that I found something that I call humanized treatment.
And then I was very excited to experience so many books, and I started doing paper, it became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, rubbed all the quickly, I left half an hour to clean the books I wanted, and soon when I got home.
(Laughter) And there he's sitting down, delicizing me with those books, and, to my surprise, Regina gets into the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe brave, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
When I got to know the experiences I'd already gone last year, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts to study, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing, and it was very difficult?"
To help the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and several class friends, who helped me, I summarized some texts, I try to enter the classroom to make the test, which is very difficult to apply a very heavy job with...
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the typical Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, "Black woman," like me, who, in the '60s, created the first synthesis of the patrodes, all this when I eat and sponsor some reports, is very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate uncomfortable.
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone.
Why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 addicts 6 percent according to 10 of 2013, are black women.
And that?
It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I couldn't understand, but she knew everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, too.
I would also pass because I took too long to understand that curriculum with pictures and good appearance is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they were suspicious, after graduation, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on, and so on?
"Yes."
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
The domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant past, it's coming from us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern senior.
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I cried and I was nervous because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment," I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door, "Wow, my boss came."
I was already with the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, so she arrives and says, "Men, it was so stressed, we forgot to take her money, atyptian Monday, the modern senior is the maid's money."
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding, but, as I'm a happy thing.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern Madonna ...
He's the maid's little box, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who's going to work, but he goes back home, and the only solution I had was to take copies from all the rooms.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I freeze myself, and so I can run away from him, because when I say that I'll change employment, my friends say, "Menine, stay, you make 1,000 items per month, you'll never get that value in another place."
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service.
It's my little soil because my soil's pot is my peak, and then I was there.
In the service rooms, tired, I got my glass pot and six in the number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the gate of ice and the toilet, and there wasn't the maid bathroom for this that I brought little pot, because the modern lady?
It's the maid's money, "Today I'm here.
Statistics, for some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are."
His grandmother wasn't a maid, but her mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for her family to come.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
Gord ... (Applause) HEP.
(Applause) Black woman, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
(Applause) Antrans of me have 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
What in other countries, various domestic work, work and study, and here, this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, but it's not to be clear which places some people have in this country, so I'm here telling you about six million households.
They're from African branches and not all dated.
I'm here today to talk to you.
About silencing.
It's already a bit funny to come out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
I first take the time of my talk to disconnect.
They connect their cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying of fear.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing the 8th grade, the conceptual day of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did the acid start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Fociso."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go."
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
It goes to the car.
Open your agenda, bravo.
It's inside your eye.
It's insecurity with equipment.
I propose inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book.
And I was sure I wouldn't realize it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos.
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
Well, it's in cure.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
It's determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his eyes.
Several of you.
I thought.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Meaning.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this space.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off, cell phones?
(Laughter) Put them on the floor, (Exhales) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags on the floor.
Chorus: Here.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
with everything closed.
You are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
Propal.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"Let's look at her in the face!"
You're good, you got even a little kiss.
AC: He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where they are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
Audience: Yes.
You see ... (Exhaling) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Walk your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are you really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Until this moment is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember that ...
Two dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
In the human brain, we are connecting space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Soundly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
Which brings the area you hear.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality: it's new, as it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
It's to realize.
That much of what we do is specific.
What we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
The silencing?
And a state of presence that comes from him.
It can become.
A habit in our lives.
They are self-awareness technologies.
There you go.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be direct between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate.
Autensity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
EDXT.
He had the first video, right?
I can say I'm a whalegan.
I had a demand for a region of Idete fans.
What did they ask to give societies?
My friends, your colleagues, your family.
Once more than just one.
It has an influence in English.
How about it when?
The translator is the key.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays?
Ten percent of them are Brazilians.
Seven and 16 young people.
And, almost all the time, 6,000 translations made all over the world.
We received it.
The talks made in events, like these here.
But it's clear to allow people a hearing impairment.
First, it's transcribed.
I said, "Golanda in general."
Look after being green for me, instead, and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
It's like the logope itself indicates.
They have technology like Pedro TET: "Entrortinely," which is "e," that we can translate as a fun.
And do you get out?
I referred to São Paulo.
They are from sedentary or competitive, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship.
and even literature.
Species that come back at times of chance.
The theme is this auditory event.
Is that free time we have?
Once again, reduction.
I said, "This video is about 20,000 Brazilian reals."
It's to translate and think about realizing how we want.
In the TEDx NGO.
And it can be.
They're worthy educational sounds, accessible to children.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what a translator.
It's a living reader desired.
It wasn't only initial, sometimes I say and hired that alone.
Not only because I had such tactic people, but I'm getting to know at this event.
But why do I think I have my beautiful?
I think it's worth using my cognitive accident.
In initiatives like this one.
Waiting for who I was.
That is potentially that I don't have everything and that is education.
And I don't have a tie, I have to go look for it.
I can integrate everything.
And when is it a fish, is it a volunteer?
Be the air that your knowledge.
Because I've always my choice, my decision.
And he has to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different from us.
And it transforms forms of a young destiny.
behind a very violent translation.
There's always.
The part of knowledge has its own.
It changes research.
Many jobs, many hours of dedication.
For us, from a translation like this, fluent, to be ours, of a kiss?
And frustrated with what?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be 1,000 million.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
All these translations and transitions.
Or, as we call it, "How about yourself?"
I want to suggest Portuguese and Portugal, because I'm different.
We have ten and six to whom I'd like to quote these names.
I read stories.
Do we have PEMA?
Audience: Yes.
I have to hear it.
What do I live there?
A deep, political crisis, right?
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Despite this, I knew how to write very well and do this.
And his dream was always able to do that.
And to do how their children rest.
That's why what was living in our neighbor from Minas called "Tairobeiras."
In some places, my father had sold his start, his middle logic, and his place.
If you know their own as commercials, it's found that Mattel in a presence store was investing years.
In 1964.
He stayed entirely, without anything, because you kill yourself in one with the nine states.
One felt very humble with his economic clown, and my father decided.
My mother, who is 40 today, isn't deaf?
It was an excerpt of cooking.
Sport of training.
And she decided to make "consects" to sell.
Travels went literally.
It's... although we don't have to eat many times, not wanting what to dress in a way.
We are philosophers to study.
And that's how it works.
A big question, without a doubt, because I already run condemned from the slope of national research by homicilious samples.
Or exception, this fascination, this passion for my father had for education?
What did I seem to them?
A caderno body prevents, snaps the peel byzone, saiu a premise, the premise that appeared at home.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalises of Parkia."
But for my father, she would check her there, napping.
Without knowing, he was training me.
We've built much better than the ones we've had, right?
And here I say, to me, the greatest passion in my audience's life are the kilos: Daniel, Henrique.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident to me or not?
Four of us, my brothers, we became teachers.
At some point of the tip.
And one of the brothers is the educator without awe, for me, fantastic, creative.
Empreias, revolutionary, what does it apply?
"So? What do you mean?
The only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion with initiatives is TEDx?
It has to do with queen.
I do more than TEDx, just as my father works in simple management in the instants.
Don't be inspired.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with her armile.
A alphabet where you can feel the things you're written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explain how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it's super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times.
And I stopped buying a rule.
It's a tiny that allows you to describe in braille.
On the street, you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, it still gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started to research, there were no thousands of processes like this, they would go online, be ready, connect with engines, and we would have a clock.
But as he didn't have the Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaking and nothing happened.
We did everything, collected and gathered everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock.
And we showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
And he really encouraged us to continue this project, to try to make a small report, a translator in Braille, was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help out in inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video that our aunt, besides the time in the clock, feeling the sounds, and let the message that many things seem very simple, still weren't created, and, even if we, two students from high school who hadn't even finished.
In high school, we are second year and we are teenagers, we are able to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help you.
Let's ask you a question.
What is hidden?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
(English) You can put your hand in the air.
Audience: Yes.
OK, we're all cutting, two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual actions.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference.
With sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a volunteer exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the goal of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
To get pleasure.
And there are thousands of people I do.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their advertisements.
We received their clients, apartments, hotels, or street thinkers.
And that no one has the pluralities.
That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm not here to talk about cases who are involved.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us from 16 or adults that didn't make sense than their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is also coherent, I think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, it's always a stunning situation by volunteer and forced prostitution.
And it also doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse this situation against sexual exploitation.
In other words, but to take all people who do prostitution by victims of traffic attacks for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
Research has shown that Portugal fell.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive. They are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
And to give you a notion.
What I've just said, Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism in which Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and, regarding the year of 2018.
Human.
Almost all of us for job exploration.
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't mean is there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
Because there's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
Very ugly.
Sured.
This is something that expects someone to wrap well.
But this doesn't respond to reality either.
Or is it just another foreign?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, that is, we know there is a diversity of buildings.
That influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they tell me is that this was an option.
A hidden option, later related to advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly witnesses a disorder and it's not recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think which image comes immediately to you?
(Laughter) The mind, when you think of a person that prostitates.
Think about it.
I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any prejudice.
Or, a woman with a bad appearance and minissaia who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, who's probably a lot of beathoxic with a relative and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Durastic.
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
But it's not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Does anyone on the street?
I say that the studies that are powerful and defeated.
The accidental cities.
Try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, telling us that...
Please, Sindroa.
which will only represent us 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they are less.
They're minorities, but they're not neglected.
Let's give the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by Sonhadias, from the University of Lisboa.
And that interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context and in the inner context, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10,2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does about the victim and the man or the oppressor, they forget that it's a percentage.
Men, matter.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, detachment.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the cliché criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex, but it's loved.
Getting series.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's that people in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, if they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
(Laughter) But there have been very strong evidence, namely, non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day, with people who talk about sexual abuse, and indicate that this law puts higher risk the sex tastes and that increases its vulnerability to violence.
To stigma.
And the disease.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
Audience: Yes.
It's a fantastic idea that without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between us.
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, and that are mainly not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of cooking our customers is unfortunate.
Because they're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them are able to perform sex professionals, there are even countries.
They have a cool figure, the sexual assistant, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual equations.
With disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about social relevance of this work.
about the relevance of sexual work and now that it's tested at any moment that I try it to be a favor.
Still the clients' criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think for them, it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
It's what was found on the work conditions.
If this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
to condemn them so strongly because stigma is so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Why is it moral?
And specifically, moral.
Sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality and considered.
That's it.
It's normal.
It's natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" considered ilogitimate.
Anormal, anti-natural, and that's when the beginning of sex is located.
And the fact that the beginning of being considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, social rejection, decridibilization, sanitation, and devalorization of people who do this activity, stigma is a mark with a profound decreit.
The stigma that rejects sex observer is strong and has many consequences: stigma, humanizes, stigma, is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex players, like, for example.
It's when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, there's no 'dexibas', a puta stigma.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
For example, the worst offense we can drive a woman is called puta.
The stigma of bridges and women's lives in two types: the honor and the disabled, the seriously and the non- seriously, those who behave well and this get bad.
And in this sense?
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of sword from MOOCs that is above any of us, any woman knows that, if you forget, the norms that are socially prescribed, there's a risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
What are we doing?
What can I think we can do any of us so that they don't keep on disrespecting sex-quality tomators?
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence. This has already been said in the morning in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge stigma.
As I'm here doing right now, I'd give a voice.
Listening to sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time, the callers of sex are everywhere organized and we use 'sitancadourity' aren't heard, it's not said, we don't want compassion or crimes of intolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think the path we have to follow.
Audience: Yes.
After all this.
And to finish?
I think it was the title.
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Art, well cure, art, healing from being a doctor.
It was the idea supported by a fundamental letter.
In the patient's medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to have a distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and to enhance myself.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships of our time, with all more superficial and more reasons: "I'm vice balance, it's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors were also there several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear India.
The Indian said this to me.
When I say there, I came across a feeling that I wouldn't have since my childhood to relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that love.
The ones that call it, the request for call, schedule, schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and go back.
Eroquys.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
The simplification that occurs can be repeated here too.
She's the grandmother because she needs to go to the middle of the Amazon for all this.
It was the path I found to discover.
At the beginning of medicine, if you made a list of topics of objectives and students, the first goals are.
Altruism?
It's your good."
At the end of the medical course.
With the same research?
The "tops" of the statement of success is knowledge.
A madness.
Some when we did it wrong.
If we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic spirit.
We handed a technical person who knew a lot about medicine, but he didn't know anything about us.
The worry?
One: the old relationship with patients, with medicine, is the remedy of the past.
In 13, the fish in medicine, or from such a father, from medicine, which is poor, doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When Dão, in mouths to the apple, Eva dings wood, this was to go on a leg trip, it's what we do until today, didn't touch the same thing. (Laughter) So why is Greece considered, instead, medicine, because for the first time, there was a method?
Maybe if it's an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated, and giving involvement to these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and created a grandma's isolation.
That is used even today in medicine formatures.
It was the world.
It was made a sector that, before Christ, I'm from one which.
These are slightly complex words, and you said three words.
In all the houses I entered, I just said to see the student's building, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, specially the seduation of women, men, children and cermos.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
If I respect this jury and not violate it, it would be the right to go for a reputation between men and all times.
If I bring the violin giraff, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, they were worried about this, and you still do the training?
We do judgement of things we thrive.
Because it has to be transcribed.
Because the patient's relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken for honor judgment.
And, in this case, I've taken an honor to participate in a position that is rigid by a judgment of waves.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this: medical knowledge proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all the knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of having a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit.
With this, we'll specialize in healing this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't."
Once I was in college, in small groups classes, as teachers.
And ...
I stayed with Spanish processes, patients with aography, resonance, microscopy and illustration.
I'll look for their belly's hands, I didn't make them at home.
"Oh, I'm not in a position too."
She called me, called my whole class and said, "Let's see the belly."
He looked at the patient's bicycle, like the patient's finger, and noticed he was smoking in front of him, and he didn't smoke anymore, a hole of his five, and showed that he had emagreced.
Our "smapper" is funny, you can live together, you're able to take care of your own clothes, of Gods, can say a lot, "The time you're putting yourself in a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that has, it can remind us of something that hasn't built us, and says, "If all this hasn't convinced us?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're exposing me to you, the vulnerable area, because it's letting you move on.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, and you're staying inside, you want to do good, and he, who you're playing well, is for him, let's take care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
They're stuck on their lap, they're appeared, they improve, but there's a bigger label.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases, our middle, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery, there's no amistantic changes, no routes, it's nothing, it's diseases like this.
And this happens: does it happen because our society is a little good?
Some of you have already raised and said,
It's very interesting to talk about the relationship with the patient.
But to be a drug dealer, I'm patient, and to be patient is to be passive.
Why are you talking about this to me?
What you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
After all, relationship actors are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
My doctors against two.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we're patient, passive, and we have to get our hands, in our cure process.
To do this?
The first point, the most important, is information.
Where did the owner talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had many copies of the size in my house, medicine and health, had a book free of health, and that didn't exist without giving up?
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor. You had to have content to talk, today, with Google, you have information insinity, many of them very good and very important, very bad.
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think when we see information: first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge call because people inside hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow for nothing to be bad because it puts me, and just like other people who are defending a personal interest.
The graduation.
Secondly important thing: don't believe in good things, no refrigerators, look, medicine has changed, now their problems usually ended.
Differently a lab with the scientist will have a recovering and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet, and my most was when I don't know: silly.
Third.
If we have a paranoic thing, like this, the industry doesn't interest you to know it.
On the bottom, no one dominates information.
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me, we don't believe it.
It's for a lot.
Any information, discuss to your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information with knowledge, information and evolution, knowledge and knowledge.
Take the information, participate in your cure, but apologize the tomato.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Cura Proceta.
Ask, demand, know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years, so."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there, fight, with all our body teachers, it's not that, right?
Really, knowing.
It's demanding.
We'll put time together.
It's to make atendments different.
The method you want is this?
They want to learn right.
They don't want to have this temple like "time time," they want to serve the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-montonous, the human area.
And we had a patient there, he had sneakers cancer.
Loua.
"Yes."
There was no orologist to bring it to São Paulo to be treated here in the future of cancer.
After all the exams, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation.
The doctor who obviously didn't speak was human, didn't speak Portuguese, was an ad.
He had a translator, his son, his fate, who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was obviously enjoying it.
And I introduce to you a consultation.
The Indius, the orometric, you like this.
ME: But that's it.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, who was all interested in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art of a short man.
So you don't need to cut a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have one.
Relatients and consultors.
We, women.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
It's a concern.
All patients.
Changing to be active in your cure process.
What's going to do with a connection?
You look at the world, but it improves you, and you'll be more invented because of this.
(Applause) Good morning, guys, I wanted to talk to the world, 35,000 Brazilian reais.
What does physics happen isn't it?
And if you make a decision to make two seconds and one person.
Two, you took the decision to make, (Laughter) talking about decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions, it's an experiment that was done with this icons magazine.
The journals were three emotions in this nature: a digital structure with 50 friends.
A printed journalist, events and authors, that a mature was as digitally more printed to also be officers.
The result of this medicine is that the majority of people chose how you are 25 dollars.
What I really like about the experiences is that usually there are two groups.
Before, a digital option, 50 workers, and an option of how to cost the victims as well.
In the middle of 15,000 Brazilian reais, he launched the print.
What did this choice change, most people chose the other?
And that made me very disappointed.
Why did I have more to launch and make this decision, and I started to study about it?
It's called Tikcoin, it's a third that is put into an equation for theory that studies cognitive tipology and neuroscience applied to make decisions, and I've learned a lot about it in my theory called Economia and Computamental.
There was a formula like this, interesting, you're there.
But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose HIV, you can no longer see the occupation.
This teacher, in the midst of her, makes the notion B, seems to be better, "Why do I pay the studies, our company, if I can have two for the same country?"
This is impressive because I started to question myself through social networks of all this, and a TED talk that even TED gave me everything on the Internet, was in a talk that he made a comparison.
These behaviors were they before today, I think everybody looks like scripts in biology.
Because I have around me.
In fact, the team should be ugly.
"You have to go to thectober center."
But we see it differently, because I've got around the Inclusive.
There's another optical accomplishment that I was fascinated by coming.
And the one that the different legs of victims are equal to the laddess pieces.
It's the same fact that I'm going to make a sleeve-te" and ask, "Tell me what I'm doing with all this."
But I'm going to show you that it really is.
Without staying at the store, we only see that they're really good.
In the same way, what is around us influence the way we see things, what is around us also leads most of all the decisions: work and technology.
And you yell and yelled working in a project to create an application through insurance, and we were picking one of the difficult pictures, it's a lot of option, and life wouldn't be explored.
You can choose the two adoptions, the three or these two, and at a certain event of insecurity, we were working and saying, "Go and other possibilities of choice."
And the team I was working now was, at that moment, gathering this puzzle with the concept of icônios magazine, which was at that time gathering this concept, with the concept of "Track" of the Expressions Revista, if the person was a mechanics, and I would see these three actions, I just realized.
who make the drawing of architecture of decisions where I'm giving my decisions.
And that caught my attention.
In the world of technology, not even the name of this profession, it's YO Ex, and the dresses or the experience of the eyes, are exactly the people who are the followers of the decisions, who work to pass the architecture of the decision, drawing all the format and environments where all these years.
AC: Why did I stop this name, mine, if today he's found a day with this father, the DRL face, he's the person who's a burden in this subject of behavioral economy to the digital world, and he was overwhelmed that was going to start with you, and the trick is to harm my grandmother so we can see and also behave.
(Applause)
If you must read some people with a smartphone, you get this smartphone for 22 hours nearby, but it comes to a research from the company that it has a little research there, that everyone in life is a trafficker out of your pocket, or outside your pocket, look at him, that everyone is swimming around.
She said, "Dad, stop yourself and think about myself.
AC: So, in those 35,000 decisions that we hear, how many offensages have the function of these digital dreams?
From these stories, it seems that we're daring the digital economy, or that I allow digital economy, many times I'll look at this new one with us.
Because they started to ask me about this.
Could it be the panic, how is it from a person who interaculates this adhesion as I am?
Will everyone change the story of the path we will take, "Will the child start to act isn't the success the name of this pride?"
(Laughter) (Laughter) In this case, it's a wall that in Austria, it's 91% and, in life, Mapa is 4%; the seller of the Federal Ministry of the Deputies, (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And then it's not fine, in this case it's a number of tattoos and so on.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Austria have 99% of men's donors? What in Austria is you already a gay donor?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a magic word called Defone.
This word is what you're already.
without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call the "capitão de nascimento," "You need to get out."
(Laughter) Someone has already took this drawing to you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my phone these days.
And then there are two options: one promised the recipes and another offered awareness; the recipes were dismantled to offers and were killing.
Someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to receive it, I went there and went out.
(Laughter) I took it to get out of the offertainment and tied out of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was already there marked to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave, if I was really in the people, and even ...
It was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver, I don't know if you get the work they love to talk.
Then, I set it up to open a time and tell a story.
And a lady?
Choosing a Q.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "Well, there's another passenger, man?"
He looked at him and said, "That he chose culto."
And she said, "I bought my foot, right?"
So Barcelona chose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, it's very interesting to imagine whoever makes these decisions.
If we go to a Google today, we need to eat a person, it has 567,000 results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from people was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the web page.
(Laughter) I love the page seven, and I see there what is the website: "I'm on the website."
I just have to ask for that.
These emphasis in English have a name in the behavior economy also has a name, they are called "innants."
It's not exactly a little push in English, I want to ask you to give a little push from the person next to you, yes.
You don't need a painting to have (Laughter) They're an ecology, beauty, and there's an excellent story: there's a theory of an author named "Britteira," he has a book called "Donante".
"And ...?"
The concept of ditonand is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these pushers in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought, "Geee, right?
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted a photo of me cutting the ice ... (Laughter) That's not the case.
AC: You're thinking that only who's falling on this is European from Austria and Detina Marca.
Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
In the midst that a text written, "I want to apply to a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you'll make in your life." (Laughter) "He's explaining me."
If you don't want to receive, take part, you have to stay in this link and ask to leave.
How many people called Lin ... (Laughter) more than 400 inscribed people?
(Laughter) So, this means that I consider all the decisions of the life of 13 people who stayed in the bond ... (Laughter) No, that was just an experiment, according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave.
And I show you the results.
People usually ask me, "Teacher?
Do you have this knowledge of these little empty spaces?
Necessity.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger and this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use it to do because someone buys something they don't need, so you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use it.
To make a diabetes patient know the moment, "It's more insulin."
Or can you use it?
To avoid truck accidents, like this bottle, at the same time, which makes the mix.
From cereal waves, to detect coxilo.
To elected an accident.
So, of those 35,000 decisions?
I know there's a lot of decision to be made, and I know that more and more we've made one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016, which did it with what?
People around the world describes 144 billion phases.
What did you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Poucos.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
How do these screens work?
How do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfosses.
We were able to be more aware that we made better decisions.
Thank you very much.
