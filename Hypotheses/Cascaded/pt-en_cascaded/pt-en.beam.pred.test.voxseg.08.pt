AC: How is the cost of disabled people?
What if there's any difference?
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everything.
Common people?
AS: And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does he dress? Is there any difficulty in wearing clothes?
And do you need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance who attended their lives.
VR: Necessities.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the cashier to make some pieces.
And that made them lose the fall of the play, outside that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
And I made her a pack with "lighty lower," elastic in the blind to make more comfort, it was a fashionable world with other disabled women, so she could make the exchange of the probe which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the vestiblio of this block.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other uncle, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a whip opening on her shoulders, with pressure button shuts, to facilitate, when her head was passing.
In fact, for people ...
who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a room that facilitates who will dress the person.
And paraplegic?
That idea, autonomy, so that person can dress alone.
AC: In this last fashion that I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, so she can identify that the play would be the one used during the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
And for women, with anism or low status, the ideal.
It's thinking of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore, in the child's children session, imagine clothes with reasons of princess and cut them off.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, and that means.
More than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped materials, lighter and more technological.
Did you know?
That was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I participated in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed brands, that are already launching inclusive collections due to the size of success which was the first, and Target also American recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
It's looking at others.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
EV: I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family always came from the rock.
AC: I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life?
(Laughter) Aren the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
He went to work with the children.
Listening of four years old.
Until adolescence, and goes by adult, "My community?
You're starting to work with the day.
And I was consciousizing people, how I...
And, "Shut up like that?"
Knowing to separate one trash from the other.
So I tried to talk to the child and he was making awareness of his parents.
The parents were choosing.
(Laughter) Do I deliver to the children?
People recognize me in the community?
(Laughter) And I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege of a school to inform myself.
But nowadays I feel like an educator.
Audience: Yes.
I spend the children I know.
In my community, we have one...
A seed collection when you go outside?
To work with this affection, we have a plantation.
I said, "Oh!
What I met a plant called Hengar's name.
(Laughter) It's a legominous plant.
What we plant from everything below it is a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
CF: And all the plants I had.
The plant below it.
We...
It has a good result.
AC: And our community?
When did he go to the arm?
(Laughter) There I met.
Of all plants.
But was it used?
To each of your place.
AC: But I tried to imitate like a building forest, right?
(Laughter) So you have to imitate the forest.
Because there in the arm.
Was there a lot?
(Laughter) Plague, who was giving more than so many.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Audience: No.
So, I tried to plant them.
VR: Great.
(Laughter) There I have the aaiu, the cup, the gray, Andiróba, Copaiba.
With Maru, Araná, and everything there, not from the beach.
(Laughter) Okay, how?
EV: So natural, at EBRAPA, I saw there was a lot of poison, a lot of top.
AC: "Mom, blah.
(Laughter) And the fruit from there...
(Laughter) Five partners of ours: in our community, we work everything with organicism.
AC: You eat everything natural.
AC: There's no toxic in our community.
OK.
(Laughter)
AC: What about human beings?
AC: Like an animal.
(Laughter) The child compared her and, just paying.
You talk.
She's there listening, and then passing to other children.
(Laughter) I'm paying and I'm paying for this attention.
Then, he talks about animal quote.
(Laughter) So I compare the child.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection.
The most caught by those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all on the axis, "My father says this.
AC: The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
(Laughter) I'm a person.
What observes my house.
I kept observing my house.
I left my wife.
(Laughter) She always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's just fine.
So ...
(Laughter) I saw all this with my work that was going to do with children?
What is the future?
(Laughter) And it would work out.
And today we have ...
It's a job inside.
"It's far from the atom."
"Your mother, human duck."
(Laughter) When I started there.
It started in 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom?
It's the turtle of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son.
Today we're opening 25,000 better.
And we're replying the river that was before.
I had a hooligan.
AC: Let's face.
It's just like that a little bit of our community.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) This hole, she smiled and...
And it ended with the river.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
AC: Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
So, I went by with people.
AC: Nowadays, when I talk about...
And the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel it?
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) It's typical.
(Laughter) They breathe the pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest?
(Laughter) Is it always talking to people educating children?
And going on with other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small.
That I'm like that.
(Laughter) When I'm in the community, I get people and come to...
Is this the next to us?
There, we're talking, are we conscientizing people?
(Laughter) I'm very happy.
(Laughter)
I'm like this, if I don't pass ...
My message, my education for other people, I feel even guilty.
AC: Absolutely, and thank you very much, guys.
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
to generate these children.
It's very proud.
My family is very grateful, these women who helped us achieve this dream, really.
And to grow this hunger.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasty and a leucemia.
It's just ...
(Laughter) It puts life at risk.
Imagine all the blindest ones you are here.
How we don't feel that.
It was like a fear that I lost a challenge.
And we had two options.
Following us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep searching for an optical mood to think.
For him, I was able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and from there, it was very incredible because all the schools and all the friends of us.
They made a whole movement, very big, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people to play blood, to donate módulos.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was ...
And when?
A child has leukemia and has life risk.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
And that's what we learned to be this lesson.
And it spread to our friends, to the most of school, to society, people on Facebook.
I'm not really talking about the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore.
The most important thing is life, fight for life and love.
The second message he passed through this public disease and all this movement found a donor.
AS: That's it.
What do people do?
They see us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's not a family that loves, that embraces each other, that's the same as all these families, because it's not deep.
It doesn't matter if we are two men.
Or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be a family?
Or a living father, or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease, for the world?
It's that my blood, my oxygen, was me manufacturing it.
Our favor.
The blood only goes crazy, I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so that raised this awareness, that we have this ability.
(Laughter) To give blood to what needs.
For someone who has a house, I don't leave.
The blood is needed in the rooms.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is processing and need, and delivering oil medication, if each foreign as the donor of wax or the chance of compatibility.
I asked two.
And a patient is about 100,000 people, so if you ...
You can save in life, it's as if you were winning the mega-have.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when it reaches three.
(Laughter) For me it was a very beautiful moment of power.
I'm waiting for them to call me to save in life without any strength, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's just the most beautiful thing and the message that ...
Or so "cene" happens to all of us.
I thank you all.
By supporting us, because of this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, we don't know how to save the lives of so big.
In other words, to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
Be like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Pala-La del Chinaud.
"Your Syrian was born in Tama.
Capited from Syria.
In January, I studied at Damás University.
Today ...
It's a refugee story.
(Laughter) It's not like that.
With my family.
My mother tongue is tough.
Arabic and the other.
A little ...
In front of the Portuguese.
The rising.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
VV: Today.
And I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
You may say, "Stay this."
What's on Slam?
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap.
It's easy to live: evolution.
It was 23 million people.
GB: I had it.
And my family.
(English) friends I knew.
From this child.
Three clothes stores: an office, engineering, two apartments.
I, a car.
Try more.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
Connecting the world, I went to countries.
AC: Like the United States.
Narrator: Spider.
AC: It's French.
And until is it a day?
And the war started on March 15.
It was in 2011.
AS: Wait.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
(Laughter) In the country.
And my city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
There were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
Hi!
I'm five years of war.
This is my country.
Audience: Destry.
What do you see?
Who I know were, thank you.
Carrica.
The hip.
She gave birth to her children.
They found their smooths.
Swed and mutilated.
I cry, a bomb.
Familiares.
In other words, Samira and don't come back.
Better still!
And last years, in Syria, they were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did I go out to work?
My family would come again or not.
Today ...
Millions of Syrian have lost everything, they're dead or refugeed in other countries.
And I'm my family.
We were there.
Very sad.
When we have to leave Syria, because we don't have bones.
And our life takes you back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day.
I still live there, in my brother, my country, my father, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
Babrotege my family.
I went to Bahirut.
Hi!
Ten months.
And I knew that Brazil had opened the doors.
For the Syrian, for the Syrian.
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad.
(English) And they went.
that São Paulo was the best city.
VR: To go to Brazil.
(Laughter) Why did I have more opportunities?
And TEDxApinas.
A week to leave Brastrada.
"Firty years ago!"
From my life.
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
Orialdo.
11 years old.
Hi, it was.
With a lot, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I took a party to celebrate my children's birthday.
And they all said very well: the food that my good thirds talked a lot.
I say "abrovita."
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
And cooking?
You can sell it.
That's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now.
But everything has a pen.
In other words, a number ... (Laughter)
And I make food among them.
(English) Until good night.
We're happy in Brazil.
Let's thank you.
of the Brazilian people.
AG: You.
They opened the pôs.
When the world was closed.
Great.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
MB: Torre.
"Hi.
OK, guys.
I had a wrong idea.
Over the Syrian.
Over Eislah.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
And then?
What happened in France?
Now, I don't want to talk.
when we talk.
The contact with homes to the person.
A submarine.
A lot!
I "slam" likes blood.
who's drinking boy to kill in name.
From religion.
AC: But exactly ...
The opposite.
Or why?
What happened, the taxpay?
It was a crime, not about French.
More, also blankets.
Syrian, the state is dynamic.
It's an organization.
Torists, who are suggesting Islam's image.
A religion.
It's the base.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since a person kills.
Without he had killed another, injured, corruption, on the earth, and how all men killed.
And that it's from life.
Is it possible to give life to all men in the courtyard, in their life, to the berçopolo, 32 years?
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, lonely, like this.
My life in Brazil showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between zeros.
And Brazilians, even with differences.
Culture and religion.
When people see a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that brings hair, just like my wife, they ask questions like, "Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use it?"
AC: This lesson at home, how are you?
(English) Alenter Jabi, today read other rules.
Men in Molière.
And they don't like touching, hugging and kissing.
I'm the voice of a wedding, some people tell me, but I've already seen some humans who do all this.
To beat, she hugs, kiss me sun, so islam has these rules.
What else?
It depends on each person wanting to buy, or not, debate well.
Freud, some things, does the same way the states who don't obey everything, are not well allowed as fat cane, alcohol beers.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
CPC?
With more than a partner.
And that never happened to me.
Why?
Because these things are enjoyed by isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
What else?
Despite everything.
It's hard to know Mozla.
After the Exibian Agency.
People always understand and respect.
Professor Muhammadez, that we must respect all religions, that everyone has the same value that we must have with all of us.
It doesn't matter, it's white sail.
I say, "Negro."
(English) Or India, that we should help the people who need, every year we have or Elsaacá.
And we gave two.
Well ...
Five, for himself.
All of our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Children, today I gave.
AC: And I invite you.
Learn more.
About Islam.
I'm sure.
(Laughter) It was something...
It's understanding that it's a religion.
That's it.
Now, my dream...
VR: And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
(English)
The precocent.
And so, my children.
And your child?
"Go to the power!"
Free.
MB: Along, yes, no.
What is the molecule?
AC: In the shortest histories of life, I've come to recite my tears, in the sweatening sun, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not take the steps of those who always expect the achievement, those who believe they've always achieved, I don't believe, soon, I face hope, my salary ends and equally like this race.
I study the girl, what they told me, I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand labor opportunities, there was a lot, a cook.
Fascinira.
Why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you take me so much to pay a Secretary course?
But it doesn't even enter the office.
Excuse me, as there was an event between the five.
To clean everything and wash the bathroom, days pass by, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation, "Hey, M-E," is to have and be a maid, if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation, that the vassoura is waiting, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and this year, it wasn't even completed four months yet.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed, I was on vacation house, due to daily rush, sometimes not time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
And I was shouting there in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And, as I use Facebook as a daily basis, I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, "Eliana, all you can do Facebook is tomorrow is my new diary," and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid for seven years.
And then, I warned them to the gallery, guys, I remembered, some stories will start to bet on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid, so that, in case, other people have already gone through this, compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
For me, the surprise, in less than 24 hours, became very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story on the Internet, it was a reference to my last job as a maid in Santo city.
In 2009, I was hired to be a cook, I had to bring the yellows, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
What was the bathroom for houses?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionated this first story on the Internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not of today's stories.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype that all of them were very moved when I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil.
And then they were able to break and I started to talk about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestications are more valued, they earn for an hour, so completely different from our country.
which gives employment announces that I've tried as abuses, for example, an advertisement I read.
P: It was for the worker.
And to work secondly.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 38 Brazilian reals.
One day, week, much less, a month.
3180 reals per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions today, there are domestications being prevented from feeding, and they also don't earn food, and I was very moved to see so many books I've always done, and I entered a room where I found something that I call humanized treatment, Regina.
And this became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, rubbed everything quickly, left half an hour to clean, to the baker, and, there, sit down feeling delicized with those books, and to my surprise, Regina came into the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and knowing the experiences I'd already experienced in the past, and then she started to spread several texts to study, I said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was little, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and it was very difficult."
And to raise awareness in the university.
With the slums, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and several class friends who helped me, summary some texts.
I press to get into the room to show that it's very difficult to convey a very heavy job with the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the cassette of the traditional Brazilian family and showing that slavery wasn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first union of domestications, and she was known by the media as a terror of lords.
All of this when I eat and sponsor some reports?
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I've come here to generate adversity."
Because I believe that only through adversity, we can change some things.
No one will follow the path with a little stone, why?
And the vast majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 79 addicts 6% according to the deese of 2013, are black women.
And that?
AC: It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be egalitarian for black woman, why do I say it's herdity service, my grandmother?
It was a maid.
My mother was a maid, and I was also a maid.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I didn't understand, but she knew everything that happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
AC: Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least, an interview.
I'd take a shock, this after graduation, OK?
I took a suspense to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so on, and then are you?
Yes.
Hi, I'm magic.
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house was in the past ...
They are luxury apartments.
What were the ones?
domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very low to us.
They are the housemaid today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I was running, chilling, and I was nervous.
What I've waited for a long time for her to come: "You're a fair day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door.
Wow, my boss came.
And then, when I get there, already with the clothes of leaving, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was so strange, ours, I forgot to take your money, Monday, I pay you."
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and affection, her mother was always going to work, and there was no time for her.
But all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there.
I just wanted to see, she got married, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to the wedding, but, as I'm deaf, I put my best clothes.
I went to the church, I was there hidden.
And I saw my girl getting married.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
It's Christmas.
I see the family of my bosses having fun, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's almost the one from the maid.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss will work.
And he's going to work, he takes it...
His wife at work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
To the house.
To hide me.
And the only solution I had was to get rid of.
Cools from all overcomes.
So, if I clean the bedroom, I get traffic.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I'm blank.
And that's how I can flee from his harassment.
Because when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menine, stay, you make 18,000 Brazilian reais per month."
I'll gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
I just arrived at a new service.
And I brought my little glass pot.
Because my deaf pot is my little Pininho.
I was there.
And in the way out of the service area, tired, I got my little soup.
This is number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?
The glass pot and the bathroom, "What's happening, no, your bathroom can I use?"
No, because in the other homes I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the maid bathroom, that's why I brought little.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's petitd.
Today I'm here.
Statistics.
For some people, in my place, it would be there in faxine.
Because, when I told my boss, I wanted to study ...
Do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
Menine, you have to be happy where you are.
That attention!
His grandmother wasn't a maid?
Only the mother wasn't a domestic age, she was already predestined to her family.
"Yes."
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
(Laughter)
Hi, my name is mine.
I'm serious!
(Applause) Black woman, bubble, teacher, peripherical and rack.
Oh, my side!
I'm not alone here, dared.
I ended up with six million houses who should only have my side.
And that at some point they would be...
What can I do to everything?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now?
And many of them aren't listening to me, but they'll be able to watch, because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone is ...
And there must be many.
Platoes, various paths and some domestications, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries various domestications work and study, and here this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, it's a uniform to be able to understand.
And staying at home, doesn't the boss know she's the nanny, but it's not to be clear what the places of some people are in this country?
So, I'm here to control in cities.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million houses.
Which one I thought African and not all the data.
I'm here today to talk to you.
Overview ...
Silence.
What's already a bit funny to go out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
At the time of my talk, first, to disconnect.
Turn off your cell phone.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying and fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
And then I was doing the octave, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
And I said, "There."
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda, think about your eye, and it's insecurity, put equipment.
I open inflammation points.
First passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a present state.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Within this feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you are not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
GG: You are you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have beliefs, no sex, you're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's a course.
And it was very scary.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that a great friend lived.
That's it.
They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was.
And all that I had experienced.
AS: Tava.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act, was determining the way I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, recently, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just stood the man.
I want to say many of you.
Think about it.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I'd really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone and ask because all of you have.
Miauça.
AS: You all have a cell phone.
And turn it off.
If you connect, come this step.
It's not close to you, it's tough.
Turn off your cell phone?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor.
What about it?
AC: Here, close your computer.
You, with the lettuces connected, close them.
And you who were noticing notebooks, closed their notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
The third of connection: who connects with the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back, look at me, look at me.
For São Paulo.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
And you're fine, you won even a veil.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
"Yes."
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, leave your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
And now, with eyes closed.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that's born.
It's fear.
In anybody's man, it's not that guy in front of you, until this guy is now with much more fear that you all gather.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
And a good space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
And in America she had it.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
Four sense of management?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, right now, a different piece.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, do you take your hand to hot light?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chica.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
Since it's new, since it's new, inclusion, equality, it's new, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
The city tells that much of what we do is determined by what we've already lived.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
A habit in our lives.
They are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
And on the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
And all of them.
They are available, they are simple.
But they're the last generation technology.
We already know that, in the future, it's evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love?
For a TED Talk that I wrote the first video.
(Laughter) And normally it's my first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so sedutive.
What is the idea of translated?
I have a demand for a TEDx fan region.
What did you ask to enter society?
It's time shared with your friends, your colleagues, your family.
(Video) In Brazil.
The translation work is fundamental once it's worth it.
Five percent of people according to prosthetic behavior.
I am.
Five percent of them have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
And translating to 16 and 16 in young people.
(Video) And with almost all the time 6,000 translations made up until the moment.
But we are only translated.
It's also how we transcend.
The talks made in events like these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world.
(Laughter) It's clear that it allows people with hearing impairment.
And I can follow the content of the walls.
When is the talk given in English?
This was my case here, it's quite Portuguese.
The first is transcribed.
(Laughter) In men's video, it's general.
To then be verified by my time and from English, it's that it's translated to learn more language.
Because, initially?
TEDx, with its own logope, says, "The bond only as TED technology, "Entrortinely," which is the "e" that we can translate as a fun.
(Laughter) And having blood?
I referred to São Paulo.
(Laughter) Nowadays.
The talks address an inferiority of subjects that go from excellent issues on political lithium, businesses, vendedorism, and literature, we have, for example, talks, the form or opportunities.
And another of my passions.
Speaking what is mexing.
But the theme is this event.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
And as well as the reduction of the human work journey throughout people.
I think it's clear that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
It's translating and researching and transcribing as a false bubble in the environment to TEDx.
which may be the "tertox" stones, or the TVs are seen in short educational and accessible even to children in a small child.
And I do this, not only.
Because translating is a passion and the country is also a strict word in my life.
(Laughter) Not only because a pleasure of translating these talks is a "sedex," but being "trox" is inside.
(Laughter) Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that the translator is a privileged sector.
(Laughter) It's not only that helps me deal with my society, only a anxious person, not only delicious, sometimes I say that he hired just half an hour and hours per radiation, two three hours went by, that happens with me so much.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
inspiring people.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent.
In initiatives like this one.
I said, "What is it?"
What was the philosopher, From?
I answered, "Princi, it's probably a girl."
(Video) It gives light to this threshold and turns itself into that.
What event is potentially that I don't have everything and education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt: education is fundamental.
For people there, less privileged.
With few crimes, two excluded to our society.
(Laughter) They can become part of a dignity in our society.
And when is it a fish, do I work volunteer?
(Laughter) I think it's a donation work.
Be the acid I have, whether it's air, your knowledge?
What if we donate on an object?
"Are you just a volunteer work?"
Because I always choose my own decision.
And I have to do the best way for that.
It's simple.
And try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different to donate the pieces.
And we're left on our feet.
Tradition is a complex activity that takes not only to know.
My strange, my sources fight, said mainly.
MA: Our life.
And renovation.
What young people!
behind a very extinct translation.
(Laughter) There's always.
A part of knowledge has time.
A lot of research.
I said, "Mom, that's it.
(Video) Woman: Thank you.
to tell me I had this ...
And behind a fluent translation, to be ours, to see?
There's always a degree of worst, anguish.
How frustrated, confined?
For the best they can do us, they can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost indefinitely.
And here I need to remember -
Because most of our volunteers ...
It's not a professional, it's very important to decide.
Women biggrades.
But what about thinking?
(Laughter) This way, we created for the quality of our traditions.
Not only about the speaker, but without respect to those who don't go.
And to guarantee this quality, all this action.
Traduations and transitions.
And it goes through a review made by volunteer exchanges.
To finally, they're taken by a "cordineter" motto, or a language coordinator.
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
In Brazil's case, Brazilian Portuguese, who added Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here namely.
I said, "Stories.
We have six girls.
We have Maricene.
EA: Cláudia?
Why me?
I have our parents.
And are they God's pupils?
Gustavo.
The tunnel or the Sun.
What is grace?
The world I take.
This obsession I have with education ...
MA: Isn't it necessary?
Menina: I was listening?
AC: Not only.
How is Brazil?
who lives in a deep, political crisis, where education is released at five of the bread, but without my own personal history.
My father.
What today would be two years if it were said badly took the primary course.
Nevertheless, I knew very well how to write very well and do the four Maths course very well, and his dream was to always study beyond because I'm studying and make some kids study.
AC: That's why what was living in our neighbor called Tairobeiras.
It was decided to change for her four children the time I paid a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
In some places, my father had sold his start, his logic, Uberas, and his place also established, with the merchant, he found that the material had a presence store, there was a version.
They're not.
In 1964, there was a great Brazilian awareness.
After this reession, and other reasons, my father went to the false and absolutely lost everything.
(Laughter) He stayed literally, for nothing years when you killed your old furniture.
One felt very humble with his economic payment, and my father decided.
And after paying your tips?
If changing for bedrooms, how is it a front or behind, eating really enjoyed?
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who's now 30 years old, isn't she deaf?
Besides waiting for the Paráito game even today.
It was not to know about cooking.
So, for many years, in my house, where would he literally win the ticket, say the ticket in the largest parents of pedalization queso?
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it works.
And it was done.
The big fact, without a doubt, because already according to data from the penis of national research by Agassa, domicilios.
In the 48-year-old crossing, at the 60s of Brazil, only 32% of people with greater solidarity than me.
Excuse me.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education?
(Laughter) I felt...
(Video) In the worst days, my father had, for example, Alávidos in Pelotas.
At the time, when I was seven, we were already alphabetized at seven years old.
And a coalcavi thought, "Where is the paraglight to the monzone, I get a prince, the coconutier needs it to appear at home."
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the most spantalized in parokia, right?
But for my father, they would get me there, knocking, without knowing, they had to train a little for this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) This is what my five siblings were able to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children better conditions than those we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my public practice, it's our two kilos, Daniel, and João Inghan.
Parents I never put this on a chair for me a newspaper, but for whom I questioned all nights?
And from stories to studies?
(Laughter) So the adventure was always a pleasure for me and four of my children.
Coincident that coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is to be funny to be.
At some point in physics.
And one of my brothers is the educator without a mark, for me, fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we had to be homicide by education.
Despite the adverse conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TED?
It has to be precisely because the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was such a simple way, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these wonderful speakers.
TEDx inspires us.
And then, fail the idea.
What make us believe.
The message?
We can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols, and then he taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's supercompliated, I started to write the letters from dots on my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times.
And I stopped buying a rule.
which is a little girl that allows you to write in Braille, in which you write, which shows the subway, "I ended up rolling my notebook and my agenda.
I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threw me, with music letters, film names, in which I wrote to her that I was learning, that gave me tips.
With that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in Santa Cruz, and we thought that maybe braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where it could feel the time.
We started to research, there were no thousands of processes of this, we'd get one on the Internet, and we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock, but saw that there wasn't on the Internet, we tend to decide what to create our own.
We started to research, learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and try to create a clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines.
The Chinese showed it to our aunt, it was very exciting to see how happy it was, who we created everything and started to work, and, about a month ago, we finished the clock, and we would show the hours and the minutes in brains so we could feel, for a long time it didn't work, and they trained in nothing, but they rewried everything she taught us.
And he really encouraged us to continue this project, to try to make a small report, a translator in Braille, was very exciting.
Every process we went through, got to know a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
and use them so that they could change the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help only in inclusion, and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video that our own had, besides the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and even we, two high school students who haven't even finished it.
In high school, we are second year and we are teenagers, we are able to create something innovative.
(Laughter) There's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
In other words, with other adult people.
We don't care.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference.
In other words, with sexual relations that dance commercial.
It's a motor trade.
In other words, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the goal of mourning.
So, and another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
And I know some hundreds.
Men.
They are women who manage their business autonomously, publish their previous ones.
We received their clients.
In the department?
His, in hotels.
Or there are street thinking.
And nobody has to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve me 16 or adults that didn't make sense that their consent is growth cases.
These are cases that must be harassed.
Therefore, criminal and judicially.
And I said, "What? What?"
Definitors must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a terminal case, and, forever, this is inherent by voluntary and strong frustration institution.
It doesn't come to talk about tragic situations for sexual action.
Attention is the confusion of prostitution.
Contracting sexual exploitation, but taking all the people who do prostitution by traffic victims, sexual exploitation, is to confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
Research has shown that it falls in Portugal.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is very little accurate.
In fact, they're phenomena.
It's what we identify, but that can be crossed.
And to give you a notion?
This of what I've just said, that here the phenomenon isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic.
And that's relatively the year 2016, the latest available data.
It indicates that 108 traffic victims were confirmed in Portugal.
Human beings.
Almost all of us for job exploitation?
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there's all an email speech.
What are unpleasant from reality?
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
It happened a lot.
It's stressed.
This is an object that waits for someone.
I wanted the salvation well.
E: But this doesn't respond to reality either, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities.
Therefore, socio-cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of construction.
That influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the internal encounter.
Investigator, interview, I'm with people who work sexually.
What they tell me is that this was an option, a hidden option.
Then, related to advantages.
And disadvantage that it is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a despair, and it's not recognized.
AC: If I ask you to think what image comes to you right now?
The mind.
It's when you think of a person who prostitutes.
Think about it.
Okay?
And I bet that most of you thought of two situations, or any other one.
Hi, then, a woman?
That's why I'm not scared.
It was and a mini-scale.
It's in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
Which is very likely the causa-personance Batox.
Certainly, there's someone exploring.
But this is only two stereotypes.
Because they are simplified images.
What don't you reflect with rigor?
It's reality.
There's a huge diversity.
There are people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences.
and a life trajectory.
They are not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I say that the studies that are actually the distance.
And society identifies itself.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
It's called Sindroe.
What will you present?
We're just close to BESAB.
I feel it.
In total, people prostitute themselves.
And when we think of a woman ...
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
(Laughter) They're minorities, but they're not intelligence.
Let's study it.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by thediac teacher at the University of Esboa and interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context and in the street context.
For example, inner, men, women, trans people.
And that, all over the country, there would be 10 victims 2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
They forget it's a percentage of men who are here.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to tell you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
AS: Although it may appear.
I'll give you an apparently humanist idea.
When it is analyzed at the bottom, it realizes that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work.
And this is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
Prohibited, selling sex.
It's very simple, but it's a crime to buy sex.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's even that the people in prostitution are victims.
His beginnings.
And so, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law was already adopted in other patents after Sweden.
And the Sweden government has talked about a remote about the great success of trafficking of this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there are very strong evidence, namely non- environmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they indicate that this law puts more stream.
That's why sex seedors themselves put rich for sex taste.
And that increases your vulnerability.
There is violence.
And the stigma.
AA: And the disease.
Another idea we have is that everyone.
That this idea of all people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
Mmm ...
It's an idea, without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, people's speeches.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's for an idea that I think ideologically biased.
Even because research has proved that the lessons between sex workers and clients.
These are complex relationships and, mainly, we are abusive relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is unpleasant.
who are the people.
Because they are disabled porters.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
"This is what I'm taking.
What is a human right?
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and their pleasure.
And many of them are able to do this through blind professionals.
Even country?
What has the humid figure, which is assistant, sexual, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual relationships with people who are disabled people, and now that destroys any argument that tends to be a favor.
It's the name of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy.
To your own.
There are economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
Communication about work connections, if this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
to condemn them so strongly because stigma is so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically morale, sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality considered.
That's right.
It's normal and natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" and consider them legitimate.
It's normal.
It's anti-natural and that's where the start of the sky was located.
And eating sex being considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural is at the base of stigmatization.
In other words, of social rejection, of decreidibilization, of health, of disvalorization of people who do this activity.
A stigma.
This is a mark with iron a deep desert.
The stigma that rejects sex observator is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes.
stigma is a form of violence.
which is based on so much discrimination about sexual observers, like, for example.
It's when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, there's no 'dexibas', a puta stigma.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The biggest offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of the puta followed women in two types: the honor and the helplessnesses.
Seriously and non- seriously those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument.
What is at the service of the control of feminine sexuality is a kind of spada of bitterness that is above any of us.
Any woman knows that if there is a sexual behavior that is deserved, norms that reads socially rescribed.
It crossed.
The duty of being required by a puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
Is it so qualified?
Why do I think we can do anything, can we do it?
(Laughter) So that they don't continue to disrespect sex players.
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
TB: It's a bathroom!
Let's start the fool.
Like a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
to challenge stigma, as I'm here now, and give voice.
Or hear sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempted attempts of silence over time.
Sex recorders.
So, all over the world, organized and used 70 but, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility, they are not heard.
AC: We haven't told each other, we don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we want rights.
And that's what I think the path we have to follow.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it was the title.
What is natural that we should continue to disrespect.
to stigmatize and criminalize the wisdom.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
MB: Love.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Artigo, well cured, art, healed from being a doctor.
It is supported by a fundamental stone in thepassed medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to be involved spiritually, it's the way it understands the suffering of that individual that I have compassion.
What you have there, dad.
But at the same time, I have to get a distancing from the tal that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and so that I can provide the best treatment for that day.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships of our time, with all more superficial and more reasons, that I was this balance, is suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors also went there.
Audience: Yes.
Divers times.
When did we get there?
In our arrogance, I lost.
And I thought I would bring something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
"Well!"
And what?
I entered a feeling that I didn't have since my childhood.
To relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that love, that service.
(Laughter)
Not Atelier.
Hello?
Audience: Yes.
"I don't come, I ask for indigenous people and I look."
(Laughter) Or not?
All the doctors who go with us and go back.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice.
What?
The simplification that is corrected can be replicated here too.
It's the small research itself and, in the middle of the Amazon, it's for all of this.
It was the path I had and why I found out.
Everything that dies?
Here at the beginning of a medical university.
If you make a list of topics of student goals, the first goals are there.
Altruism went well.
AS: On these same students.
And in the symbol of medicine, with the same research, the typics, the statement, success.
To recognize, to cure.
Something we did is wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant stigma.
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The Belgian relationship with the patient, with medicine, breaks everything.
(Laughter)
Because it's the weight in medicine, where the father, the medicine, is touch.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't done.
(Video) When I love it, in apples of apple.
Eva disaggered him, and that was on a stone trip.
That's what we do until today.
"I'm not the same thing."
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father in medicine, why for the first time?
He had a method?
You can.
How?
It was short, something that can be taught.
I learned, reproduced and applied.
And in a way that the involvement of these people had a store.
A grey-regulation.
The video was created in the isolation of a grandma.
Because, until today, it's used.
It's a cure of metals.
It was a status of 50 years of crisis.
I'm in a door.
It's not there to sleep.
You're here three words.
Who's in all houses?
She said, "It's just to see the building of the patients."
Elected all the volunteer and corruption.
And especially the seduation of women, men, children and surroundings.
That's it.
And you saw the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
And if I respect this jury, I didn't hear it there.
Being an equality and reputation between men and all times.
And if I bring the violin revolves, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, they were worried about this, and you still do the training?
We do judgement of things that we carry with and have to be broken.
Because the patient's relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken by July of honor, and, in this case, I've seen a honor of taking part in a profession that is taken for judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece is an individual.
To produce science in a way that our fellow man could go further.
What happens?
Medical knowledge proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable.
To absorb all this knowledge.
So, today, a patient has a medical team, and often has a class, and each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we'll specialize a lot, incurate this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't, no.
Once I was in a classroom in college, in small groups, as a teacher.
(Laughter)
And I thought, "What happened?"
Look, patients have aography, resonance, industry, as it copies us, illustration.
If I focus their hands on their belly, they wouldn't be awareness faces.
And I said, "OK, I'm really."
The future caught me so much, called my whole class and said, "Let's see the net barrier."
I wanted to notice how the patient's finger was forming and saying he didn't smoke anymore.
The five-year-old hole showed that he had immamity.
Mans on Earth.
Lum, elderly, you can see.
If he is building care.
Right?
The suit can say many things: when you're using the patient, there's a moment of intimacy that you have, if you can remember something that didn't tell you in your practice.
If all this doesn't convince...
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to extend me.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally for him, to be careful with him, that you're wearing black people, that you want to do good there, that you're asking good, they're for him, let's take care of you.
This is this magic.
It's not only beautiful for your child, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap and are appeared, improved faster and have a more precocely ralk.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases, our middle, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
If there's no surgery operation, there's no horizontal changes, Halloweas, you can't see anything, diseases have symptoms.
And this happens: does it happen because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already got up at Frasti Boop.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's average relationship, but to be a drug dealer, I'm patient and to be passive to those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk to a group of doctors.
Because, after all, relationship actors are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two aires.
I had doctors, bills donated.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're patient, passive, and we have to hold our hands, which were our cure process, but also, to develop their cure process, in the decisions of the sector.
To do this.
The first point, the most important, is information.
And not where I'm talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, is not fashionable. When I was a child, there were mothers with size pieces in my house, medicine and health.
I had a book, a health book, and that always existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to meet someone, publish something, because it's a editor, (Laughter) that you had to have content to talk, today, a Google, you have an insinity of information, many of them very good and very important, but many tries a lot with it, and we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see information first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they allow me not to do that badly, because this put me, just like other people who are defending personal interests, gaining, selling, or other things.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: information is running, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing that has discovered today, tomorrow it's on the internet and my more when I don't know it, silly.
Think, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
If it's based on which information dominates?
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me is that they don't present, and finally.
Take the information, discuss it to your doctor, it was for that.
The information, in the greatest knowledge, information and information, is knowledge, takes information, participate in your cure.
Second important thing to be a national activist.
In a processing action is asking, demanding, knowing.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
If you have a right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years."
And I know I must for the time.
(Laughter) But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of...
And to exist is not to get there fighting with everyone.
Only how this is.
Really, you know?
And there is, to compost with time.
To make atendments different.
Do you want doctors?
They want to be worth it.
They don't want to have this attempt, like, "No time," they want to attend.
And once?
Because I was in the Amazon, in Venezuela, near Venezuela, pre-montonous area in the human area.
And we had a patient there who had skin cancer.
Loua.
NJ: In our finger.
And there was no speechologist for us, we brought it to São Paulo, which is being treated here at the Cancro Institute.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation, he was one going, and he didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, had a translator, was the son of the destiny who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
And he was obviously assaulted.
And I presented a profound.
What would give us a scene from a film.
The polometric index, you like this.
Oops.
The doctor went.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had all this interest in taking care of him.
This magic?
Because it's the art of a short medium, so you don't need to talk a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors working on prosecutors, in ambulants.
In the office, what are they?
And I said, "Oh, no.
What am I doing?
Culting your hand fight.
What is it?
We're attending it.
MA: We, elderly.
And we can try to find.
The more unity of our treatment, the more compassion.
And all the passengers.
Try to be active in your cure process, which is not to do, because it gives a connection, connect the world to have better, and you'll be more invented, something different.
Please.
I wanted to start with the world here: 35,000.
What happens to have this money?
This number is the quantity of decisions that human beings make daily.
And it makes more or less a decision every two seconds.
And the person, "Hmm?
(Audience) Two.
Do you remember making a decision for those who have to give this talk?
He talked about decisions I wanted to tell you about, with a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions.
The experiment was done with this icornic magazine.
The murders of the magazine had three emotions in this nature.
AC: A digital nature with 59 dollars.
A printed magazine structure, the Servinho Circudois, which is a literature that is a little digitally printed to be made as citizens.
The reasoning of this first is that the majority of people chose as CFR52.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups.
For the second group, I only exposed two options.
GB: A digital option, 50 workers.
GG: And evolution of how José do Victores too.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When they told me about these experiments, I wanted to think that this notion of the means of entrepreneurs is a press notion.
What did nobody choose?
What did this option change, most people chose the new one?
And that left me very uncomfortable.
Why would I want to overcome and make this decision?
And I started to study about it.
(Video) CF: I studied a lot about this and I found out that this person didn't come to the name.
She replied.
AC: It's a silly that's placed, it's not equation.
to influence this Dr. They make a decision or another one.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Computamental Economy, for the theory that studies cognitive School and neuroscience applied the decision-making.
I wanted to give a formula like this, interesting, you must study.
I had spent two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the option.
You've already shown the same way to see something past.
AC: This one of her e-mail has her name to be better, for whom I'll always pay and sell five dollars.
AC: Our company, if I can have two, at the same time.
This is an impression, because I started to ask myself why it's all about it.
And a talk that even from TED made me understand everything.
Her name is to make a comparison.
These behaviors were they before today.
I think everyone seems a better problem.
The cycle of their users seems a little bigger than the blue symbol in the right.
Please?
Because I have around me.
You need to do things full, at the same time.
TB: You have to go to thectober center.
But we see it differently because I've got around the Inclusive.
There's another biological illusion that I was fascinated by coming.
What is this here?
The pieces of needing chess up.
They are equal to chess and lower pieces.
(Video) Narrator: It's the same time that will do your problem before arriving at all this.
But I'll show you that it's the same.
Without staying in the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
When I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes some sense to say that what is around us enthusiasm.
In the same way as what is involved, the way we see doubts.
What's around you also reserves is the means of all the decisions.
I work in technology.
I didn't know where to avoid working in a project to create an application through insurance.
He told me, "If we want to be happy."
It's a lot of option and life won't be explored.
You can choose this illusion of dreams, of three, or this is two.
And he won't be old, insecure.
Because we were working and they said that 500 km of possibilities of choice.
The team I was working was there today, it's a way to sign this choice for people.
This way was done in another profession, if the person was a whole work, she would go to these three options.
You thought, "You came to the clinic and took these three donations."
At that moment, fighting for being like the concept of Economics magazine.
I have just realized that there are people.
What makes the drawing of architecture of decisions, today I'm walking in decisions.
This called me a lot, in the world of technology, there's even a name for this profession called YO Ex, and the Researchers' experience or Duário's experiment, which makes people exactly.
And they are the architects of the decisions, working with the decision-making architecture, drawing all the forms and environments of all the decisions.
Why did I stop this name, mine, if today he found a day with this father, his face is him, he's the person who's a burden in this behavioral economy issue, and he said, "Look, I found here at UFRJ, and take it with Denário Helen."
which really changed my renovation of seeing and behavior.
I think we don't need research to know that we use a good cell phone.
That everyone had to go through their pocket or outside their pocket, looked at him, but there's still a research in Brazil that he has a competition.
AC: If you must have some of you who have a smartphone, it's a smartphone thing for 22 hours standing up.
He decides to lose you and you get them with Helen Moore.
So, thanks to 35 million decisions we make.
How many of you think they are digital decisions?
During these releases established this regitor Rosa, moth and digital camera, or that allowed people to be in their world.
I started to ask myself about this.
Would it put the button and the horizon with us?
Intervistator: What did this decision start?
Will everybody go crazy, and we put it on the "wes."
The ex-sistor of the way for us to say, "Can the bathroom begins to act without the elite that the world will discard?
AC: And how are these decisions from him, shouting power?
For me, the digital world spoke for us.
Narrator: Is it yours?
(Applause)
It needs identity.
Talking about Dougramas, I should talk to you about another interesting way.
It's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata it's Equada with C.
I've never thought of thinking about what it was and say, "It's the number that has come to be free."
I don't know.
But it's not strange.
(Laughter) In this case.
It's a number of two young people.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Australia have 99% of young people's pain, what in Austria is you already a yoga donor?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a magic word called "defol."
This word is what you're already.
I don't know how to do anything.
These are the decisions I call the "capitão de nascimento," "You need to get out."
Someone has already took this picture for you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my phone these days.
And then, there are two options: one survived the reels.
And another one for me to receive.
Hello.
The Greeks were discarded to offers and were marked.
So someone decided I wanted the party and I didn't want to receive it, so I went there and went out.
What to get out disappeared from the offer and came out of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened it ...
I was there of breastfeeding so I could take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave if I really was.
Menina: Good morning.
I thought it was cool to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with Uber's driver, I don't know if you get the work they love.
And then, a truck from Uber once tells me a story.
Here is a lady.
Did you choose?
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "OK, there's another passenger, man?"
He looked at her and said, "This is, he chose the cube."
She said, "It's not that I looked, right?
So Barcelona was going to choose him without even knowing.
She chose what was already chosen by her.
This is very complicated, it's very interesting for us to imagine who are these decisions.
AC: If we go to Google today, do we need a person's comedy?
It has 5.67,000 results.
What do we create?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we went to eat from people was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I'm there and I click on peace to be born.
I love the page seven, and I see there what has the page not: "I'm on the web page."
Just to ask her.
AC: Actually, that's Google, Uber, giving us little pants.
AC: These English disturbs have a name in the behavior economy, they also have a name, they are called "inhandates."
It's not exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to study information on the person next to you.
AC: It doesn't need water for me.
Are they like that, beauty?
So this is "no."
What is there with theory?
AR: From an author called "Britateler," he has a book called Nães.
And the concept of ditonand is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these emphas in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself."
I thought, "I want an adult."
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a photo of my important view.
AC: You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Detina.
AC: Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
AC: In that environment I had.
And written: "When you apply in a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you'll make in your life."
(Laughter) Luis Pica, me.
If you don't want to receive it, it's easy to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
And how many people criticized the book?
It's more than 400 inscribed people.
CF: Three people stayed together.
So, this means that I can make all the decisions of the life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, that was only an experiment according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I motorize the results.
I encourage people to ask me:
Why have this knowledge of these discomforts?
Of those grades.
This can do because we manipulate someone.
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
Like, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it to make someone buy something they don't need, or you can use it for good, know the moment, and also insulin.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this dog at the same time, that makes the metaphor.
From cereal waves to detect coxilo to avoid a city.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
And there's an event that happened in 2016, that made people come down.
44 billion phases.
What did you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
What do I believe?
What if we understand better?
And how do these screens work?
How do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more conscious.
so that we make better decisions.
AC: Thank you.
