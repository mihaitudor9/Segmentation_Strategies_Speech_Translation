(Applause) (Music)
Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference...
What this issue brought me so much, or if it should have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dressed room that embraces everyone, people with no disabilities, today I'll tell you why I work with this.
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does he dress? Is there any difficulty in wearing clothes?
Does it need someone's help or do it?
Is there any interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that attained their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play.
And outside that they lost a lot of time and lost money, and they often stopped using something they'd really like, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their body.
After this job, the conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist, was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was a fashion with other disabled women, and I made her a lady with a very high cause, elastic in her seat to make greater comfort, and made a discreet to make her exchange for the son, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the skin actress with some surface, and I obviously didn't put their backpacks on their shoulders because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
I made Carlena a blouse opening on her shoulders.
With the closure of pressure button, to make it easier when it comes to mind.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic that gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a seat ...
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in arms so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
And for women, with anism or low status, the ideal is to think of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes in the childish session.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, that means...
More than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and producing more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana?
And I took the second place.
I...
Silvana ...
A "drika."
And many other people ...
Several other stylists ...
Little brands are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed brands, and Target also American, recently launched an inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first.
For all of us should think of this, we should have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
[A.DE.]
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
And I was conscientizing people, as a four-year-old child, up to adolescence, and passing by adulthood.
Putting the beginning: knowing how to separate one trash from another.
So I tried to talk to children and it was making awareness of their parents.
Parents were giving me the children.
People recognize me in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate.
But nowadays I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I do with the children I know.
In my community ... (Audience) Hi!
We have one ...
A seed collection when you go to the forest?
You'll work with SAF.
Do we have a plantation?
Once I met a plant called Hengar's name, she's a legominous plant.
And we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I eat.
And in our community, the plant below it, we have a good result.
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
That all plants...
It was used each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate like a small forest, right?
So, you have to imitate forest, because in your arms ...
There was a lot of plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Isn't it?
So I have to plant them variating, there I have aheau, a cup, a graviola, Andiróba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná.
And everything there can't be a plague, (English) "Light, how?"
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside without comparison to ours: in our community, we work there, everything with organic.
You eat everything natural.
There's no tox in our community, OK?
I?
To accompany human beings as an animal.
The child, I compare her and count only to pay, you talk, she's there listening, and then passing me to other children.
Popagai was watching this attention, then he talked about animal quote, so I compared the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection, the most caught by those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all on the axis, "My father says this: the first lesson we have to pass by has to come from our home."
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person who observes my house.
I kept observing my house and ... Audience: She kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's just fine.
So, I saw that all this that my work was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's to work out.
And today we have ...
A job in the corner is far from the atom.
"When I'm going to take?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tartaruga of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river that had a hooligan before.
In front of us, it's a little like that of our community.
And ...
This hooligan, she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the "repovo" year of the saw.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I'm going back to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... we breathe a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest ... (Laughter)
It's always being talking to people teaching children.
And ...
And I'm passing with other people, and I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small, that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and come to be next to us.
Let's talk about it, how do we bring people into practice?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Oh, guys, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you very much, guys.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
My family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream of reality and create this family.
(Laughter) This puts risk life.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
And we had two options.
Choose us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep searching for an optical melody, to think.
They made a very big movement, spreading the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people, donating blood, donating medication, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement, so they could get a fear transplant, what they need to be cured.
We shared a very important message for all of us: first for us and then for the rest of the world.
It was that when a child has leukemia and he has a life risk, all or the rest of fears, worries, doesn't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and that's why we learned this lesson and spread it to our friends, to the school's more, to society, Facebook people, talking about it, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
What matters more or more is life, the fight for life and love, the second message he passed, publicly, and all this movement of thought was donor?
People saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a mother divorced warrior, or important, I love the family, this union, this is what gives strength, this that gives life, this will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trankède passed us with this disease to the world, "What?"
My blood, my hatred oil, we started to make them: our factory.
The blood only goes crazy, I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so if he raised this awareness, we have the ability to donate blood for those who need it.
For someone with blood cancer, blood is needed in the chests, when we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is echoing and need it.
And donate "sexy" mulla, castrate as a donor of "sedula ócia," the chance of compatibility.
So, if you - between a donor and a patient - when I got married - Oh, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to save in life, you can be a tiger, a hero, I can save in life, without me, but without any motivation, I'm donating a part of me, to save in life.
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate módulos to save lives and be superheroes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
It's called Laikon.
You looked at it.
(Video) The base is like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Talola El Chinau.
Her Syrian was born in Damasco.
It's the capital of Syria.
I, an engineer, studied at Damasco University, today, I'm a refugee in Brazil with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little ...
(Laughter) That's why, in French, in Portuguese.
These are excuses, without a few moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brocancer," which exerces Slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with Slam.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful, cheap and easy to live in the population was 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew since I was a child.
Two apartments and I loved to meet the world, an engineering office, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15th, 2011 in drama, then it came to all other cities of the country.
My masco city was the safer of Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
Good, in five years of war, men and the country are destroying.
People: whom I know him were forced to carry on, or their children's left.
The last years they found their injured and mutilated foots for family bombs, disappeared and didn't go back to Syria, they were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian are dead or refugeed in other countries, they saw everything.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we, bars and our lives, remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
It's about how Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so I went to Bahirut, after ten months, to protect my family and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why had more opportunities?
And the Apinas Teve, or a week, to leave brains.
Fifteen years of my life ...
It's starting again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, the food that my good thirsty spoke very well, and everyone said very well: two children, Orial 11 years old, I was very happy, and I realized that it was the kitchen very well.
(Laughter)
And making food to sell, that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) (Applause) I'm there with Syria.
(Laughter) I make food and I deliver the Whatsapp Youb. (Laughter)
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, many people had a wrong idea about Syrian.
I think Islam likes blood, and about Islam, today in the morning, or a journalist tells me, "I, after it happened in France, like a person, a submane, now and I don't want to talk, or talk.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the French soy, but also Branus, who is spreading Islam's image, or Ovoso, our sacred book since he killed one person, without killing another, or an terrorist organization, or Syrian, which is allowed to kill in the name of religion, but, exactly, to the heal, about the tulmid, the dark, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, I don't understand any type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like culture and religion differences.
When you use this lesson at home too, this heat, you use this lesson at home, just like my wife and my wife, ask questions like, "Why do you use this handkerchief?"
Alin TG Jabi, today, read other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, and kiss, ex-usted from the wedding test, some people say to me, "But I've seen some humans who do all this?"
See that Taoislam has these rules, but it's from each person wanting to buy, or not, the debt well, it prohibits some things to be the same way that they don't obey everything, that they drink alcoholics.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
That is, it was sex as more than a partner.
This will never happen to me ... (Laughter) Why are these wise things from Islam?
Our religion is very important for us.
But Profeita Mohamádez, that we must respect all religions, that everyone has the same value.
That we should be true with all of us.
It doesn't matter, and we gave two dots five parts of our money for the poorest people, it doesn't matter if the poor humans are ordeal Christians, and I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows better or Islam to end prejudice, makes my children.
And your children?
Balbuder to grow together based on the cellulary.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my tears, in the Sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the tears of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe it, soon I lose hope, but in the daily bucket I know who suffers: "Geee, I eat," my salary ends, just like this race, I study the girl, it was what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand a service opportunity, there were a lot, a cook.
Faxineira, why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for option, I have several friends who are in this situation and who are already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, I give myself an opportunity and the mouse told me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, enter that little side that the vessor is waiting, welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, the page I created on Facebook, like the newspaper, wasn't yet programmed to my surprise, in less than 24 hours, and, as I use Facebook, it came to my memory, some reports will start to bet on Facebook, and I was stuck there on the couch talking about the past, always speaking in the past, today I came to talk about the success of the beach.
Then, soon afterwards, I put my first story on the internet, I had to bring the yesterday, I couldn't use her cup in her house, nor the bathroom, I was hired to be a cooker to feed me with her own food.
At her house -
There was a bathroom for houses, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared this first story on the internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed many media, both the international media, the national media, London's tons, the German TV Dábio and many others.
All of them moved a lot when I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil, and they were able to break and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, domestic work gained for an hour, so completely different here in our country, an ad that I read.
It was for workers and working on a second, access.
Every day, week, much less, every month, from 8 am, at 18 hours, earning 380 Brazilian reais per month, 300 and 80 reals per month, which is our condition here in Brazil, there are domestications that are being prevented from feeding each other.
And then I was very excited to experience so many books, and I started doing paper, it became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, rubbed everything quickly, I left half an hour to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I enter a room that I found something that I call humanized treatment, which is Regina.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to show me several texts to study. I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then she sat there with me and said, "What I'm doing, I was very hard."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I'm here to generate uncomfortable."
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, right?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established that, that, and so on, and that's you?
Yes, or I'm magical ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not to have a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the houses today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Oh!
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to get there on Friday mornings, I hear her going with her clothes, just waiting for her to pay me, and she arrives and says, "Menine, it was the maid's money."
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and affection, her mother was always going to work, there wasn't much time for her, it's the granddaughter's breakfast. I'm seeing her family of my boss having fun, everybody happy, and she knocked me a sadness.
Because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little box of the employee, because modern senzala, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who is going to work, and yet he goes back home, the worst moment of my life is when my boss will work.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can run away from his cassettes, because when I say I'm going to change employment, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you gain 1,800 reais per month, you'll never gain this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala.
Because my saving poin is my peak, and then I was there, in this line of service, tired, I took my saving poin and made it in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the pot of knowing if the bathroom is used, and there wasn't the maid bathroom for that I brought the lemon, because the modern lady?
It's the maid's money, today I'm here, contrary to statistics, to some people, in my place, would be there in the cleaning lady, because, when I told my boss that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for your family to serve."
So, you have to be happy, being able to come, so I'm here telling you the statistics: black woman, fat woman ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)
(Applause) Woman version, teacher, peripheral and rack.
On my side ... (Applause)
I wasn't alone here today.
Behind me, there are 6 million houses.
(Laughter) That it should be next to me.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do, I would run that my life doesn't think of money we don't have money.
But just seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
Because in other countries various domestications work and study, and here this domestic work has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, it's a uniform to be able to identify it, so I'm talking about six million households.
They're from African foundings and not mandated.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Music) (Applause) I'm here today to talk ... (Music)
About silencing.
What's already a bit funny about exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
First time in my talk, to disconnect.
You turn off your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because it's about dying and fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Who says that silence is a door to who we are emotionally?
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself ...
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
Open the agenda.
Take your eye.
It's insecurity, with equipment, marvelous inflammation points.
The first step ofuriation.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos.
I remembered an author's quote, he spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
That feeling, from that moment of presence ...
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
The human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Much less.
It was a lot of anger.
This is not in body.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now it's little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you ...
He just kept his eyes.
Several of you ...
Did you think?
No, I don't need it."
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
Turn off, comes this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
(Exhaling) Put them on the floor, (Exhales) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags on the floor?
(Audience) Yes.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You with the readers closed them, and you who were noticing their notebooks, closing their notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now...
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
For the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
No, I'll look at it like this."
You're good, you got even a little kiss... (Laughter) Audience: "Well."
He was connected, guys.
Look, folks!
Do you see where they are?
Do you see?
Do you see?
(Exhaling) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Very closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
Take this step with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TETO?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are.
Feel the chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They enter the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
And I said, "No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, as it's new.
Equality is new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence?
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become ...
A habit in our lives?
These are self-awareness technologies.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Get more generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
The direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another autensity, silence is a source of freedom.
The TEDxT.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video, (Laughter) which is usually the first view.
How was my case?
I can say it's an absolutely hard competition.
Audience: Yes.
The walls are so serversive that the idea of translated part of a demand of a region of fans and ideas.
who asked behind London's births shared with their friends, their colleagues, and their family.
In Brazil, the translation work is fundamental, once only 5% of people agree with the Turchical apartment of the sun.
And, above all, they have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer traditions around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
translating to 116 languages.
And, almost always well in 6,000 translations made up until now.
But we not only translate, but we also transcribe the talks made in events, like these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world.
But, as for me, allowing hearing impairment, I can follow the content of the talks.
(Laughter) When the talk is not to give English, my case wanted to read in Portuguese, first it is translated into the original language.
To then be verified for me, instead, and from English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially, the TEDx with its own logope indicates: "The bond only as TED technology, entertainment, which is "E," we can translate as entertainment.
And I thought about the stage to refer to it.
Currently, the talks lead to a inferiority of subjects that go from excellent issues on political entertainment, businesses, entrepreneurship.
and even literature.
We have, for example.
Species that come back at times of chance.
Another passion, by testing what "disages" is this cognitive event.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only of our greatest expectation of life.
It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
It's to translate, rethink and bring as an pride of talks in the environment for "TEDx."
And they can be the "terrox" for these TEDx stones, or TEDx people are short educational, accessible to have children.
Very small.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and father is also a strict word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," but to be "trox" is inside.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember the translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my society, that I'm quite anxious.
Not only it was innocent, sometimes it's the day we hire, but half an hour and hour, look at the clocks, two or three hours went by, that happens to me in other translators.
(Laughter) Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here receiving.
inspiring people.
But why do I think my theme is precious, because I think it's worth using my cognitive excedent?
(Laughter) In initiatives like this: "That's TEDx."
(Applause)
(Applause) Secondly, the philosopher was the microphone.
It opened itself the option of a man in life.
Audience: Love!
It gives light to oneself and become what is potentially, that I have no doubts about education.
It's fundamental for that.
I also have no doubt that education is fundamental to go people less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society.
They can insert themselves in a dignity way in our society.
And when it's a volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge.
Can you help an object?
Just because his volunteer work gets my choice, my decision.
I have to do the best way possible and I have to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces, the remains of our time, the translation of complex activities.
Our language.
And Men Fongos, who is a young destiny, because of a well-special translation, there's always a doll of the first knowledge.
Many research, a lot of work, many hours of dedication.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent to be ours of kiss, there's always a shadow that hears distressed.
And frustrated with what?
As small as you do, he can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost indefinitely.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations, not only in aligning respect, but in respect to those who will watch, right?
And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transitions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally took advantage of a cordiner's motto or a language coordinator.
Or as we call it "ELC."
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, where we managed Portuguese, which is very different.
We have ten elites, which I would like to cite here nominations.
I read stories, we have Helena, we have Maricene.
Claudia, and me?
And our boys, who are for me, from my grandson, Gustavo.
Túnel or "soft" and Rafael.
(Sigh)
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
Very well, this obsession that I have with education has to do, not only with Brazil, that lives in a deep political crisis, where education is released at five of the bread, but without seeing my own personal history.
(Laughter) My father, who, today, would have about two years if he was alive, mistreated the primary course.
Despite this, he knew the term "bem" and did the four characteristics very well.
And their dream was to always be able to study language because I'm studied.
And to make the children study, that's why homosexual people who lived in our neighbor called "Iobeiras."
He decided to change for his four kids at the time, I stop very strange, the biggest city than girls.
And, on some side, my father had sold his start, his Uberas shop, and his place.
They also knew, as a businessman, they had a small hotel from a presence store they had replaced before.
(Laughter) However, in 1964, against a great reession in Brazil, due to this reession, and other reasons, like my father was the false and absolutely lost everything, he stayed, literally, without anything, that you killed in his nine-comed nine.
(Cheers) Many of them felt very humiliated by their economic plague, my father decided after paying his teeth, if he changed his tears, as a mother is in front of me, to go back, to eat well and enjoy it.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who is now 90 years old, isn't Arizona, right?
I cried to be a player for Paráito yet, eyes for water.
It was an excedent film, a soccer team for me, "My bicycles," and she decided to sell marriage juice.
So, for so many years, in my house, a pair of queijo was literally Caiopó, say passing on the best queijo and pedalizing parents.
(Applause)
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
Audience: Yes.
And that's how it was done: a big done, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penetration of national research by love and households.
In the 48-year-old crossing, in Brazil's 60s?
Only 32% of people have greater solidarity than me, yes, fundamental.
And this obsession, this step, this passion my father arrives to education ...
Transparentia?
In the smaller days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself.
At the time, when I was seven, we were already alphabetized at 200 years old.
And a provocator who think of a notebook and said to the producer, "No, a doctor came to him and to any visitor who appeared at home."
(Laughter) You can imagine ... Then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalisas de Parkia," right?
But for my father, she would get to laugh babies.
Without knowing, he was living a little for this talk here, and anyway.
My five siblings were able to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children when our dreams were better than that, right?
And here I talk to my greatest passion in my program's life, which are my two children: Daniel, that young Henrique.
Which I never put it as the chair to see the newspaper for me?
But why did I question all the nights?
Let's tell stories before everything, guys.
It's always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincident that, coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is to be a seriously.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is reeducators without a mark, for me, fantastic, creative, integral, revolutionary, that it applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we had to be homicide by education.
Despite the living conditions, despite developing our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx, just as my father was such a simple way, inspired us.
Just like today, it was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
They make us believe that, despite everything -
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with our armile, an alphabet where some can feel the things that are written.
AC: During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it's super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a replete, which is a small one that allows you to describe in Braille, in which you write that shows the retreat.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, it still gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the schedule.
We started researching, thinking that there would be thousands of projects of this, we'd get on the Internet, and we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and then we'd have a clock, but saw that there was no Internet, we had to decide robotics, our teachers' programming.
And trying to set up the clock, so we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and the minutes in braille so you can feel.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to try to make a small report or a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that something that was born from an interest can help with their aunt's inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
(Applause) So we'd like to show a video that our aunt, besides the schedule of the clock, the senses, the pines, and leave the message that many things seem quite simple, they haven't been created, and, even if we, two high school students, who didn't finish ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask a question.
What do you think?
There are harmful people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
(Applause) You can put your hand in the air.
Audience: Yes.
Okay, we're all short: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
This is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference, with sexual relations that dance commercially.
It's a half exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the objective of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their ads, receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or have street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about this that I've come to talk about and not about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults that didn't make sense than their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, therefore, to cope with volunteer prostitution and processed frustration.
But it doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action: the tendency is to confuse the situation, against sexual exploitation, it's to confuse.
A small part, as if it were the whole.
(Laughter) Research has shown that in Portugal, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, Campo de Calfonomer isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that runs Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and, relatively in 2018.
Humanity.
Almost all of us for job exploitation, victims for sexual harassment.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't mean is there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
Because there is an image in a very historical way of preservation to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
Defense.
Sured...
And that you're waiting for someone to wrap well.
But does this also not answer to reality, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-cultural inequalities, that is, we know that there is a diversity of buildings that influences the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they tell me is that this was an option.
What a hidden option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a dese and isn't recognized.
(Sigh)
If I ask you to think which image comes immediately to you?
(Laughter) The mind, when you think of a person that prostitates.
Think about it.
OK, and I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any other one.
Or, a woman from Malaspeto and minister who is in a corner, in a dark street in the city.
And that is very likely a secode touch, and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
of practices?
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and life experiences.
(Laughter) They're not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many transgents of sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Of someone on the street, I tell you that the studies that are the distance of being made.
And sedentary care.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that...
Complete or place.
Because it will only represent people around 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they're less, they're minor, but they're not negligible.
I'm going to give you the studies of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by the Spanish teacher at the University of Esbola, and who interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of interior, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage is trained higher, so, when the speech does about the victim of the man or the oppressor, you forget it's a percentage of men who are.
In sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the medicine.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden?
From 1999.
It's not prohibited to sell sex, but it's a crime to buy sex.
The idea at the bottom of this law?
It's that the people in the presentation are victims without exception, and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
(Laughter) But there have been very strong evidence, namely, non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse and indicate that this law puts higher risk the sex tastes and that increases its vulnerability to violence.
It's the stigma and the disease.
Audience: Good afternoon.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
(Laughter) They are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
For an idea that I think ideologically biased, even because research has proved that relationships between...
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, and that are mainly not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of cooking the customers is unfortunate.
Because they're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities ...
Without right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can attend sex professionals.
There are even countries.
They have a Hongal figure, a sexual assistant, who is someone who receives training to know how to have sex relations with people who are disabled persons.
And I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work and since now that destroys any argument that tends to be in favor of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make it easy.
To their economic needs ...
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done yours.
What was found on work commissions?
If this can be done, without more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically sexual moral, which divides sexuality into two types, to the other side having a sexuality and considered legitimate.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" considered illegitimate, normal and natural.
Anormal, anti-natural, and that's when the beginning of sex is located.
And the fact that eating sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and natural, is based on stigmatization, of decreidibilization of people who do this activity, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many discrimination on sex wisdom.
Like, for example.
When he runs into institutions in the health area, justice, and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way, now, a little bit, that I don't know if someone used this word, "No TEDxBas," the stigma of puta.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
And the worst offense that we can drive a woman calls her puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and honor, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and this one behaves bad.
And in this sense?
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of the control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of mirror of MOOC that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that, if there is a sexual behavior, that is socially divided, there is a risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
(Laughter) So, what do I think we can do any of us, can we do so that they don't keep on disrespecting sex-speakers?
And I think that the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And I too.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
to challenge the stigma, but I'm here now and give voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempted in the most vistentative of silencing over time, hasn't been told to say, "We don't want compassion, we don't even cry of intolerance, we don't want rights," and that's what I think we have to go on.
Audience: Yes.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural, that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure it.
Art, well cure, art, cure from being a doctor.
It was the idea supported by a fundamental letter.
In the patient's medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to spiritually engage, otherwise the way I understand the suffering of that individual, that I have compassion, that I have there, father, empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical resource.
It's a technical judgment, and so that I can propose it?
The best treatment for that divism.
This balance is very delicate.
And the human relationship of our time, with all the superficial and most rawest: "I'm in this balance, it's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips that I followed many doctors, they were also there.
It's different sometimes.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
Bantilular, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have from my childhood.
to relate to someone who needed my knowledge to do and to be able to offer that engagement, that love, that service there.
He's polite.
The ones with this convention, the request for call, schedule, or schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and go back.
Eroxia.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another field practice.
The simplification that occurs can be replicated here too.
It's the grandmother because she needs to go to a middle of the Amazon to discover this, it was the path that I and protect.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university before.
Have you done a list of topics for every student?
The first objective is:
Or altruism?
It's even good.
Of those same students at the end of the medical course.
With the same research?
But signs are success and knowledge.
Cure.
When did we do it wrong?
If we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic stigma, and we handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry about the average relationship with the patient, with medicine, is going back to the past.
In the growth, the fish in medicine, or that father, in medicine, which is poor, doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When the lemon cracked the apple, the "eva desengae" and that was to make a leg trip, that's what we do until today, it didn't touch the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and little your father in medicine because for the first time?
We must have a method there.
It can transform the art of healing something that can be taught, learned, retrodessed, replicated.
And to give a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and created an isolation of pedocrimes.
And even today, it's used in medicine forms, around the world, a king sector of Christ, people of a quota, in fact.
These are slightly complex words, and you've prepared three words here.
In all houses I entered, I just said to see the patient's damage.
Exiting all the volunteer and corruption damage, especially the sedution of women, men, children and surroundings.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
It's respecting this law and not violating it, it would be the dignity of equality and reputation between men in all times.
And if I bring the violin, what happens to me the opposite?
Why, at that time, was you worried about this, and you still do a dinner?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to be thrilled, because the patient's medical relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken with honor judgment.
In this case, I was honored to participate in a position that is registered for a man's judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of having a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit.
With this, we'll specialize a lot, incurate this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in class in college, in class with small groups, like teachers.
And I played with sports processes, patients, I have choography, resonance, and how illusion copies us.
I'll look for their hand in their belly after their awareness.
"Oh, I'm not less composing either."
Each called me a bit, called my class and said, "Let's see the patient's belly."
He looked, had to hide with the patient's finger, who denoked what was smoking in front of him, and didn't smoke anymore, five-year-old, and he showed that he had emagreced.
As these in the skin are bright, you can have fun.
The neighbour is able to take care of his own clothes, his dirty cage, he can talk a lot, when you're mexing in a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he has, he can remember something that doesn't teach us, and said, "If all this doesn't convince us?"
Besides, as you're seeing patients.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move on it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, to be mixed in black, to be good, and to be careful for him, to be careful for you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, improved faster and have a more precocely ralk.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery, there's no amistantic changes, no rays, no rates, no diseases like this.
As I said, what happens is that our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the patient's relationship.
But to be a patient, a patient, and to be passive, to those who are saying this to me.
Anyone you're going to talk to a doctor's group because, after all, the active act of the relationship are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two habits.
Here in months, in the patients' counts.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive, and we have to hold our hands, which was our cure process.
And it's not only going to look for healthy life, but also to engage in the process of healing, in decisions for the healing process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
Where did the owner talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had many size copies in my house, medicine and health, had a book free of health, and that didn't exist without giving up?
The difference is that, at that time, to meet someone, publish something, because it's a editor. You had to have content to talk, today, with Google, you have information insinity, many very good and important fabrics, but many very bad times.
And we need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information, it's greater than the filtrate capacity.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see the information first.
Information, today, usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but you don't even who I am.
This gives me a huge call because people enter there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they know they don't have me for anything because it puts me, because just like other people who are defending personal interests, gaining, or other things like this.
So, signature, the second very important thing, doesn't believe in good things, the ideas, look, medicine changed, now their problems usually ended.
Differently a lab with the scientist will have a disturbing and immediate discovery, without the scientific society being maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one is on its own, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet and my doctor, when I don't know, shaking.
The third: if there's a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
You're shaking, no one dominates information.
It's hardly some other interest and exclusion behind, so these things from my Paris are that they don't believe.
For a long time.
The idea is information: discuss to your doctor, he's there for that.
Information is not the same as knowledge, information is knowledge, takes information, participate in their cure, but rebuilt the average cost.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura.
It's to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, in a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years in October."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there, fighting with all our body teachers, it's not that, it's crazy to know.
There's, if we compost with good, we'll make atendments different.
The methods want this, they want to have right.
They don't want to have this attempt, or their names at the time, they want to take care of the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, the area was mom.
And we had a patient there, he had a patient's cancer.
It's a bit humorous.
Thank you very much.
And there was no speechologist with whom we brought him to São Paulo, which is being treated here at the traffic Institute.
Hi.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation, the doctor, who obviously didn't speak German, didn't speak Portuguese, was an ad.
He had a translator, his son, his neighbor, who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was obviously furniture.
And I introduce myself a consultation.
And, for me, you'd give us a scene from a movie.
The index looked at the doctor.
This is what it needs.
Isn't it?
The doctor was, "Dad."
Very well.
(Laughter) What I'm trying to say with this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
What an individual?
Without stretching the language without having a completely different culture of the other end.
He handed his soul, that other individual, who was all interested in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art to heal.
So you don't need to cut a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors working in proposals, in ambulants, in office, who are anonymous.
Doing.
One.
Culting the soul, a fight.
Excuse me, paying attention.
So?
We, doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
It's a concern.
Every partners.
The active pleasure in your cure process.
This makes me have a connection.
It looks at the world, but it's better, and you'll be more treated, difficult.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
