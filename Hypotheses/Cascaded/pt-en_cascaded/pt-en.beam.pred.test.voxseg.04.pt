Have you ever stopped?
Are you going to think?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
My role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dreshold that embraces everyone, people with no disabilities.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress? Is there any difficulty in putting clothes, does it need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion, but almost all of them had trouble finding a dressed room that would meet their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play, outside that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work of these conversations, the conclusion I arrived.
It was this: making clothes is that this cost was really necessary and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
The elastic in the blindness to make more comfort was that a desfile world with other women without disabilities, and I made her a calmness with a very high cause, which made a discreet zip to make her exchange of the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other uncle, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I did Carlena for people who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a locker who facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic who gives autonomy, so that someone can dress alone.
AC: In this last fashion that I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a very ergonomic section, I've already done it in the seated position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name in a army, so she could identify that the play would be the one used during the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
And, for women, with anism or low status, the ideal.
It's thinking of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore, in the child's children session, imagine clothes with reasons of princess and cut them off.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped prostheses, and they are producing me more technology.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took the party dress to Juliana?
(Laughter) And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana ...
Drika.
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands are already adapting pieces in their collections.
who was already in their second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first, but it was out there that the big companies, famous and designed brands, who realized the real need of this cost, and are already launching inclusive collections.
All of us should think about it, have empathy, look at others.
(Laughter) The world?
What is changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal with our differences, thank you very much.
What is this?
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melodisplasia and a leucemia.
This leads the life of the enriching.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel.
Like a fear of losing our child.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
Following us, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and keep searching for an optical mood to think.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, donating medication, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was ...
And when a child has leukemia and is at risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
And that's what we learned to be this lesson and spread to our friends, to the schools, to society, people on Facebook, telling the truth, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this disease, as public as well, and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a homosexual family, a parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces each other, which is the same as all these families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a mother divorced warrior, or importantly, I love family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Trankède passed us with this disease to the world.
My blood, my medular courage, we were able to manufacture them, our factory.
I'm a healthy blood, I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so if he raised this awareness, we have the ability to donate blood for those who need it, and if it's not only for someone who has cancer in blood, blood if it needs to be parts.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everybody is processing and need, and delivering oil medication, if each foreign as the donor of wax or the chance of compatibility.
Between a patient's donor, it's about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you win the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I caught myself ♪ Oh, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to be able to save in life, if me, more strength, without pain, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that the tancreto passes us all.
I thank you all.
Socking ourselves for this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, doesn't know how to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
What happens?
Be like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Pala-La del Chinaud.
Her Syrian was born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
In January, I studied at Damás University.
And today I am a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little French in Portuguese.
That's why.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Broancetto," that exists about Slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap, and easy to live with the population.
What I knew from this child was 23 million people, and I had my family, friends, 23 million people, two apartments.
I, a car in Damasco, and I liked traveling.
I loved to know the world, went to countries.
AC: Like the United States.
Sbania is France.
Until one day the war started on March 15, 2011 in Draa.
Later.
I arrived to all the other cities of the country, my city of the mask was the safer of Syria, between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
Like Tipoi!
Five years of war, man and the country is destroyed.
People I know were forced to carry on their children's homes, they found their periped and mutilated foots for a bomb.
Familiares disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian left everything, me and my family were very sad when we should leave Syria, because we, bars and our lives, left behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
Babrotege my family, I went to Bahirut.
(Laughter) Later, ten months.
It's about how Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk in Brazilian Baixada and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil because there were more opportunities.
And I had the Apinas, or more week, to leave brains for 40 years.
From my life, and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, and everybody said very well, the food my voices made talked about my children's birthday, I took advantage.
Who's the kitchen?
Very well.
And making food to sell, that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, "Hotalade" with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has a pen and paper.
In other words, a number ... (Laughter)
And I make food in betweengo.
(Laughter) Even good Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, thank you.
The reception of the Brazilian people.
(Laughter) You opened the pots.
When the world was closed.
Branus, Etress, because of war and attack.
(Laughter) To be a designer.
Many people.
I had a wrong idea.
Over the Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, or a journalist tells me, "I, after this happened in France, now and I don't want to talk, or talk, or contact with a Muslim person."
A lot!
I'm Islam loves blood.
that is allowed to kill the name of religion.
But exactly the eggs, the attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the French soy, but also Branuse.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization, the Syrian, who is suggesting Islam's image, a basic religion, or Alcurão, our sacred book since a person killed, without killing another, or mourning life to the courty, in their life, to the dark, 30 hours.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims, they kill, Muslims, lonely, like me.
And my life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even with religious culture differences.
When some people say to me, "Don't instantly understand, "Imitted as a bordo box," and my wife asks questions like, "Why do you use this heat," "Why do you use this linson at home too, "doblate well," "big," "big," some things, "you," "you've done," "I've screwed" from the wedding."
When I left the bus in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner, this isn't happening to me.
Why?
(Laughter) Because these things are made of isolation.
But, although we don't know Moislam, after the Exibican Agency, those of you always understand respect, our religion is very important for us, or even Mohama says that we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value that we should have with all of us.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black or Indians, or that affects well that we should help the people who need, every year we have Elsaca, and we give two dots five percent of our money to the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if the poor are human beings.
Cristated, today I gave.
And I invite you to learn more.
About Islam.
I'm sure it was something to be and to understand that it was a basic privilege.
Now, my dream...
Here in Brazil, the world knows the best Islam.
(English)
(Laughter) With "Ou" play.
So, my children.
And it's your child.
Valbuder, grow together at the base.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the short stories of life, I come to recite my tears, in the sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the loans that always expect to reach, whoever believes to reach, don't believe, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity of service, there was a mountain, a cook.
Faxineira: Why don't they hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, he gave me an opportunity, and the mock told me, "You follow this corridor, you'll jump, turn on the left, enter that little side, that the vessor is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: today I came to talk about the success of the page "I used maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016, and since I created this page, it wasn't programmed, I was in vacation house, due to the daily rush, sometimes not time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life, so I picked up one day in the middle of my running life, and I stayed there on the couch of what I've accomplished, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach almost in front of me.
And remembering all that I achieved, some memories also came from when I was a maid for seven years, and, as I use Facebook, as the diary, I put everything that happens, my mother up to me, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid, I couldn't use the cup in her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
What was the bathroom for houses?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared this first story on the internet, it went viral very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, because the housework outside Brazil has another symbolism, the households are more valued, London's babies, Germany TV, and many others, I interviewed many media here in our country, for example, an advertisement I read.
PL: It was for the worker.
And to work in second, access.
Right when I got home, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, books have cost a lot, and my domestic mother, going through these conditions, today, there are domestic, but, in a single house, I found something I call humanitarian treatment, which is Regina entering the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts to study. I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world." Then she sat there with me and said, "What I'm doing, I said, "Wow, I was very hard."
And then, for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the cassette of the Brazilian traditional family and show that the university, with the faxines, because I entered the university was all resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and several middle friends, who helped me, I summary some texts, I pay to enter the classroom to make tests, it's still not done.
Because, today, I came here to generate adversity because I believe that only through the adversity, in Brazil, a woman named Lao delina de Campos Melo, Black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first house sindicate, and she was known as the media terror of the patroas, all this when we can change some things.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
AC: This service can't be egalitarian for black women, why do I say that at the service of being an authority, my grandmother was a maid?
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least an interview, they were suspicious. After graduation, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that, and so on, and then you would say, "Yes, I'm magical."
(Laughter)
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not to have a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the houses today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door, my pattern came."
And then, when I got there, I was already with the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was so strange, ours, I forgot to take your money, Monday, I pay you."
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding, but, as I'm a happy thing.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little load of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss will work, he will work, he takes his wife to work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back.
To the house.
To woke up, and the only solution I had was to take pictures from all over the world.
So, if I clean the bedroom, I get traffic.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his harassment because, when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menine, stay, do you get 1,800 reais per month?"
I'll never gain this value somewhere else, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money because the modern snake ...
It's the maid's petitd.
I just arrived at a new service.
And I brought my little glass pot.
Because my deaf pot is my pnic.
I was there.
And in the way out of the service area, tired, I got my little soup.
And it did this in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the owner's gate and the bathroom, and there was no room for the employee's bathroom so I brought little?"
Because modern Madonna ...
It's the maid's money, today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people, in my place, would be there in the faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
Menine, you have to be happy where you are.
To pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but her mother wasn't a domestic, she was already predestined for her family to serve.
So you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, containerian, statistics, black woman.
Right.
Hi, my father.
I'm a holiday!
(Applause) Women, teacher, peripherical and rack, next to me.
I'm not talking here, dared.
(Laughter) Yesterday and a half are six million households that should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do, I would run that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money, but just to see that six million households are being represented now, because in other countries various domestics, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
So, I'm here with theory in statistics, "I'm not doing it!
I'm talking about six million houses.
Anyone I thought African and not forced.
Invisible, the air in the wind.
Invisible, the air we live in.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny about exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Turn off your cell phone.
Don't photograph, because I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
And then I was doing the octave, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did Silvio start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20.
And from the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda, think about your eye, insecurity, equipment.
The bridges inflammation points, the first step from the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote.
He used to say, "This is the entrance door to a present state.
When did I remember that?
And, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Within this feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you are not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're your human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys, what I found.
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that a great friend lived.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act, was determining the way I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just stood the man.
Several of you.
They thought, "You don't need it.
So now, I want others to justify their importance here, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
And turn it off.
You connect, come this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off, cell phones?
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
And put your bags, the floor?
(Laughter) So, back then, you close your computer.
You, with the leths connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It stern of connection: who connects with the human being.
Now?
And look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look at me, look back on the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
And you're fine, you won even a veil.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
You see ... (Exhaling) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born of fear.
In any man, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
It's a fear of what's inside you.
It's afraid of this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes?
And a good space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
I remember TED?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
And from the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
The strong sense of direction?
There's a knowledge, you know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, right now, a different part of your mind is caring.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to hot chicken chicken, and soon you learned that a little before your hand you could play a chicken, you felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chicara.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected and feeling where you are.
Observes.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
What remples the area that you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Try it.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new, since it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
(Laughter) It's you who you are.
Look inside and explore silence is realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
A habit in our lives are self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them, so available, are simple.
But they're the last generation technology.
We already know that, in the future, communication will be the evolution of race, direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video.
(Laughter) And normally it's my first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so sedutors that the idea is translated from a demand of an ideal fans.
who asked to translate for an hour share with their friends, colleagues, and their family.
(Video) In the case of your Brazil.
The translation work is fundamental once it's worth it.
Five percent of people already remember the "productive."
And 5% of them have an English influence.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
We are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
translating to 166 languages and almost 6,000 translations made up until now.
(Laughter) But we are only translated.
We also transcribe the talks made in events, like these here.
The work of transcription is important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow people with hearing disabilities to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk isn't given in English, as it's my case that creates Portuguese, first it's transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified by my time and in English, it's translated to learn more language.
Because, initially?
Currently, the talks address a infelity of subjects that go from this environment about political litro, businesses, benedorism, and literature, we have, for example, TEDx with the logotype indicates, "There used topics with technology than rooting, alhearse, the form of science works."
And another of my passions.
Finding what follows the topic is excellent with the mind.
It's that it has a resume that we have, then not only for our biggest expectation of life.
(Laughter) It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout people.
I think the shoe that one of the uses I make in my hearing reception is to translate, make and transcribe as a talk bubble in an environment for "date," that can be the selfies for these TEDx stones, or the telephones are curious educational views, accessible to children infit.
And I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a strict word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," that is, a "sedex," that is, a pretty anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the book that Trantor is a privileged mentor, not only that helps me deal with them with me and with the treatments.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
inspiring people, but why do I think my time is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive excedent in initiatives like this: stupid.
Second, the philosopher, "Eddy Frome?"
The main lesson of men in life was given.
Audience: Yes.
(Video) It gives light to yourself and become what is essentially, that I have no doubts about education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt: education is fundamental.
So that people, less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society, can live in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask for volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, be it I have, whether it's the quarter of your knowledge, transport an object.
(Laughter) Just for being a volunteer work, because being my choice, my decision.
And I have to do the best way possible and try to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces.
And some time left.
Tradition is a complex activity that awakes not only to know the same foreign, the fights of source, or mainly our world.
GL: And João Fogos, who are young.
For tests from a well-established translation, there's always a wide knowledge of one month.
What changes research?
(Laughter) A lot of work.
And many hours of dedication.
And behind a fluent translation, to be kiss, there's always a great worst distress.
And frustrated by failures?
For the best they can do us, they can always do the best.
Because the text can be improved almost in definitions.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations.
(Applause) Not only about the speaker, but about whoever talks.
And to guarantee this quality all translations and transitions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally took advantage of a cordiner's motto or a language coordinator.
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, that we managed Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here namely.
I said, "Stories.
We have IPM, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
We have our boys, who are for me, my grandson, Gustavo.
(Laughter) The tunnel or the sun.
What is the grace?
The world is good.
This obsession I have with education ...
(Video ends) In the city, she came to hear.
Not only with Brazil, who lives a deep, political crisis, where education is released at five of the bread, but without the same my personal history.
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
(Laughter) Despite that, I knew well how to write very well and do the four maths tests very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond because I'm studying and make some kids study.
(Laughter) That's why what was living in our neighbor called "Tairobeitas."
(Laughter) He decided to move around for his four kids at the time, I paid a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
In some places, my father had sold his logic to Uberas and his place was established, too, with the merchant, from a small hotel, there was a presence store that had in the rest.
(Applause) In traffic.
In 1964, there was a great reession in Brazil, due to this reession, and other reasons, with my father was the false, and he lost absolutely everything, he stayed, literally, without anything that you kill in his mobile phones.
One felt very humble if I paid with my father's name, decided after paying his teeth, if he moved to Belo Horizons like mom in front or behind, to eat very enjoyed from the zenco.
MB: In first perspective.
My mother, who's now 30 years old, isn't she deaf?
(Laughter) Besides waiting for Paráito Games today, there.
It was an excellent cooker, who carried directly by holding my hand, and she decided to sell markets for many years, so, for many years, in my house, wherever she wanted, literally, to win the grandma, say a ticket in the largest pains of waste of perdoorization.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it was done.
The big fact, without a doubt, because already according to data from the penis of national research by Agassa, domicilios.
In the 48 years' franchise, 60 years from Brazil, only 32% of people with greater solidarity than 5 percent.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
(Video) When I was younger days, my father, for example, had interconnected Alávidos.
(Laughter) When I was seven years old, at that time, we were already alphabeted at seven years old, and carbon was standing, when the owner asked my newspaper full of gold to him, and to any visibility that would appear at home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the most spantalized in parokia, right?
But for my father, they would get me there, knocking, without knowing, they had to train a little for this talk here, anyway.
I've made a question of all nights, stories before everything, but we've got more than that today, we can give our children better conditions than the ones we've had, and here I tell my greatest passion in the life of my public practice, they're my children.
Coincident that, in coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is, without a doubt, a seren.
At some point in life, and one of my brothers is an educator without a mark too fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that they apply to the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, obsession, we had to be homicide by education.
Despite the adverse conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was so simple, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
TEDx inspires us.
(Laughter) So spread the idea.
What make us believe.
To think about everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where she explained how she worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols, I started writing letters from dots on my notebook, and added me, I did many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threw me to her who was learning, I still gave me tips.
With that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in Santa Cruz, and we thought that maybe braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where it could feel the time.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming our teachers, and it only shaved in nothing, but it reescribed everything, disconnected and reconnected everything, and it started to work, and, about a month ago, we ended the clock, and showed the hours and minutes in Braille, to try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, was very exciting.
The whole process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that something that was born from an interest can help with their aunt's inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet, and even if we, two students from high school, who haven't even finished, in high school, we're second, and we're teenagers, we're able to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help the body.
Thank you very much.
Let's ask a question.
What do you think?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
You can put your hand.
OK, we're all agree.
Audience: Yes.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use, the only difference or the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercial is that there's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the objective to have profit and another part with the objective of having pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know a few hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their advertisements.
We received their clients in apartments, in hotels.
AC: Or there are street thinking.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults that didn't make sense that consent is crime cases, are cases that must be chosen, criminal and judicial.
And the criminals must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual inertion.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is overwhelmed, I also think there's a terminal case, and, forever, there's always a stilherent type of traffic for sexual action.
The tendency to confuse this situation, against sexual exploitation, is to confuse a small part.
It was as if it were all.
Research has shown that Portugal the traffic phenomenon falls towards sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that can't be identified, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I've just said, that here the phenomenon isn't possible, I'm going to give you the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that teaches information about the issues related to human traffic.
And that's relatively the year 2016, the latest available data.
It indicates that in Portugal 108 human traffic victims were confirmed.
Almost all of us for job exploitation?
In other words, victims for sexual structure.
Only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there's all an email speech.
What are unpleasant from reality?
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
It's very defense.
The explorers that are something waiting for someone.
I wanted the salvation well.
E: But this doesn't respond to reality either, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider that they are victims and they consider they had an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate to economic inequality.
So, inequality of cultural parts.
In other words, we know that there is a diversity of buildings that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I meet a researcher interacts conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they say is that this was an option, a punished option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage that is to enter an activity which is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a deserted and not recognized.
What if I ask you to think what is the image that comes immediately to you?
The mind.
It's when you think of a person who prostitutes.
Think about it.
I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any black guy, or a woman.
That's why I'm not scared.
Because, from lombrics, who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, which is probably batoxicodeparent, and who, of course, has someone supported, but this is only two stereotypes, it's simplified images that don't reflect on rigoring reality.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and life experiences, they are not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
What about someone on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are powerful and flaws.
And society identifies itself.
And try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, show us that the street presentation.
What will you present?
We are only about 10 to 20% of the total population of prostitution.
And when we think of a woman ...
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
(Laughter) They're Ministers, but they're not neglected.
Let's take the studies of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by thediac teacher at the University of Lisboa, and interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of the street, as in the context of the inside, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 10,2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher, so, when the speech does.
about the victim woman, the man or the teacher.
They forget it's a percentage of men who are here.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to tell you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
And even though it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work.
And this is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
Forbidden, selling sex, but it's a crime to buy sex, the idea that's based on this law.
It's even that the people in prostitution are victims.
With no exception, and so, if they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other pensions after Sweden and Sweden government has talked a lot about the great success of being this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there are very strong evidence, namely, non- environnemental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they indicate that this law puts more stream.
That's why sex wisdom themselves put together rich gender wisdoms that increase their vulnerability, violence.
There's stigma and disease.
Another idea we have is that everyone.
That this idea of all people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
Mmm ...
It's an idea, without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, people's speeches.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's for an idea that I think ideologically biased.
Even because research has shown that the lessons between sex workers and clients are complex relationships and that are mainly not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of eliminating the customers is unfortunate.
They're the people who have disabilities or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who recruit sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have the right to their sexuality and pleasure, and many of them can help sex professionals.
Even country?
What has the Hongal figure, who is assistant, sexual, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual relations with people who are disabled people, and I think this example is quite clear about the relevance of sexual work and who already destroys any argument that tries to be the favour of customers' criminalization.
Ah, then, if people...
You can do this as an option.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be yours.
Control to work connections if this can be done without more explanation than in another job activity, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of morality, and specifically sexual moral, which divides sexuality into two types to the side having a sexuality and considered legitimate, normal and natural.
And, in Portugal, we have a deaf "sex" is considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural, and that's where the commerce of the sky is located.
And eating sex is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, social rejection, of decreidibilization, of disvalorization of people who do this activity.
stigma is a mark with iron a profound delivery.
The stigma that rejects sex observators is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
What is at the base of so much discrimination about sexual observers, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area, justice, and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone used this word, "No TEDxBas," "The stigma of puta."
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The biggest offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of the bridge directed to women in two types: the honor and the disabled ones, the serious and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of democrate mirror that is above any of us.
Any woman knows that, if there's a sexual behavior that's disappointed, norms that reads socially, it's horrible.
The duty of being required by a puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
It's so little.
Why do I think we can do anything, can we do it?
(Laughter) So that they don't continue to disrespect sex players.
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge stigma, as I'm here now, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempted attempts of silencing over time: the callers of sex.
So, all over the world, organized and used 70 but, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility, they are not heard.
(Laughter) We don't want compassion or crimes of tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to go on.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense?
What is natural that we should continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is crazy.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Art, well cure art, cure the doctor, is supported by a fundamental stone, in the pregnant medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to have a complete distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so I can provide the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationships with our body, as a surgeon, in these trips that I followed many doctors who were also there in different ways.
When we got there, in our arrogance of ...
It's "Evit Branca," I thought I'd take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
That involvement, that love, that service there, Bando de Bullá, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have from my little childhood to relate to someone that needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person.
AS: The ones that this convention requires indame, schedule or schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and focus on that.
And Rouquist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another field practice here.
The simplification that's going can be replicated here too, is the copy that she needs to go to the middle of the Amazon, which is all this, it was the path I found to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university, if you make a list of topics of student's goals, the first objectives are: altruism, even good.
Of those same students, in the medicine symbol, with the same research, the topics of the statement: success, knowledge, cure.
Some when we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant spirit.
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
That's it.
The relationship with a Belgian relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back in the past, in Greece.
Because it's the weight in medicine, where the father, the medicine, is touch.
It doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before, when Dão, in mouths of the apple, Eva dances wood, that was to make a leg trip, that's what we do until today hasn't touched the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father in medicine, why for the first time?
He had a method.
You can.
It transformed the art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And in giving a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
At that time too, it was developed and created a grandma's isolation.
Because, until nowadays, it's used in the medicine graduation in the world.
It was done a century before Christmas, and I'm on a door.
These are slightly complex words, you prepare three words.
In all houses, they entered.
It was then worth to see the editor of the patients, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduation of women, men, children and ceremies.
That's why you've heard respectfully the life of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
Because it has to be transgrid, because the more patient's relationship is essential for a good cure, if I respect this law and not violate it, be ethnicity to go for a reputation between men in all times, and if I transvest the violin, in this case, I have the honor to participate in a profession that is registered by a judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way, that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical team that takes care of having a class, and this class is taking care of a little bit of it, we are losing the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't, no.
Once I was in a classroom in college, in the classroom of small groups, as a teacher, and ...
I played with the ladies and patients, I have choography, resonance, enduspy, when it copied us, ultrason. "Oh, I also compost, let's see the whole belly, and so on, I call myself the class with this science."
But isn't it?
I had to cover how the patient's green, that degenerated that he was smoking in front of him and didn't smoke anymore, but it showed that he had emagreced.
Men, mapping, mum and fat, you can see if he's able to take care of his own clothes, dirty umbreak can say a lot, "The time you're mapping in the patient, you have a moment of intimacy that has, if he can remember something that he didn't tell you in the doctor, and says, "If all this doesn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally for him, to be careful with him, that you're wearing black people, that you want to do good there, that you're asking good, they're for him, let's take care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are taken on their lap and are appeared, improve faster and have a more precocely ralk.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no operation in exams, there's no Antianic changes, no Halutis, no sees anything, NGOs have symptoms.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and said, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the average relationship of the patient, but to be a patient, I'm patient and be passive to those who are talking to me."
Because we'll tell this to a group of media because, after all, the active act of the relationship aren't the doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two aires.
He has doctors, bills donate.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, that was in our cure process, in the decisions of the cure process.
To do this.
The first point, the most important, is information.
Not where I'm talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had an ex-copesis of size in my house, medicine and health, there was a reading book of health, and that always existed, the difference that, at that time, for you to know someone to publish something that had a good generally signed information.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they believe for nothing, it's not bad, because it puts me, just like other people who are defending personal interests, money, or selling media or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: don't believe in good things, you're not maturing this for a while, information you run, nobody does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet and my most when I don't know: wandering.
Look, if there's something a bit paranoid, because the industry isn't interested if you know this, it's hardly, there's some other with cross-functional interests, so these things stopped me and don't believe me, "You're good, nobody dominates information, and finally?"
Take the information, discuss your doctor, and it's there for this: information isn't the same as knowledge, but apologize your doctor.
Secondly important thing to be a national article in the cure process is to ask, to exist, to know, when you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years later."
I know there's little time, but I don't think that's going to change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in the teacher, it's not that, it's crazy to know.
And there is: if we compost with time, we'll make atendments different.
Doctors want, they don't want to have this attempt, but not an hour, they want to serve the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, Parémontonhosis, the area was a girl, that we had a patient there, with a skin cancer.
There's humor.
In Uber, there was no orologist, and we brought him to São Paulo to be treated here at the Cancer Institute.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his trip, he was one off, not speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, had a translator, was the son of the destiny who spoke very little Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was completely scared, and I presented a consultation that would give me a scene from a film.
The Indius, the orometric, you like this.
"Oh, OK, OK?
The doctor was, "Dad!
(Audience) Yes.
(Audience) Yes.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had everything to be careful about it.
This magic that wants the art of well-being, so it doesn't need to talk a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that a doctor has to be performing in prototypes, in ambulants, in office, which are anonymous.
making a gluting good light, healing, taking care, then, we doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment, more compassion, and all patients.
Trying to be active in your cure process, which is not to do, because there's a connection, and the world has better, and you'll be invented, something of poverty.
Good evening, guys.
I'd have to talk to the world here, 3,500... What should you have seen next year?
This number is the quantity of decisions of human beings take a day, and it makes more or less a decision every two seconds.
Two: two, you noticed having a decision for those who interpret the façal and the speaker.
AC: He talked about decisions I'd like to tell you about, with a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this Icolans magazine, the murderers of the magazine had three emotions of this nature.
AC: A digital city with 59 dollars.
A magazine structure printed the "Servinho Ciculares," which is a structure that is the most impressed digitalocoon because it's also the winner.
The result of this experiment is that the majority of people chose as CFR52.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups.
(Video) For the second group, it was only an exhibition of two options.
GB: A digital option, 58 players.
GG: And returning like with the requirements as well.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to think that this notion of the means of entrepreneurs is a printed notion.
What did nobody choose?
What did this option change, most people chose the new one?
And that made me very uncomfortable because I wanted to launch more, that I would make this decision, I studied a lot the crisis, I studied that this person in the middle and even the name, called Tikore.
It's a position that is put in an equation to influence Dr. They make a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Computamental Economy, for the theory that studies cognitive School and neuroscience applied to the decision-making.
I'll have a formula like this, interesting, you're there.
