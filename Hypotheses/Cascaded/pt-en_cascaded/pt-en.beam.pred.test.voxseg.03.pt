Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference or if it should have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a locker that embraces everyone, people with no disabilities, today I'll tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work, and one day ...
And a kid came to me in a wheelchair.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress? Is there any difficulty in putting clothes, does it need someone's help, or does it interest fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
So, many times they'd buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, and many times they'd stop using something they'd really like, but almost all of them had trouble finding a clothes for wheelchair women because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this job in these conversations, the conclusion I got was that this college entrance was really necessary and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
And I made her a pack with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort, it was a defile world with other disabled women, and I made a hyper-descret for her to change the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the vestiblio of this piece, and on the back, there was no sewing and no take-off so that they are injured by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a bag on the back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to disappoint with others without disabilities, in fact, for people who are quadripletic, the ideal, is to think of a trauma and paraplegic that of autonomy, to be able to dress alone.
And, on the other hand, I made a very ergonomic way out, I've already done it in the seated position, to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I drew a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name in Braille, so she could identify that the play would be the one used during the defile day, in fact, so that people could have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
Imagine clothes with the adult reason, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore, childish obsession of the lojas: "Ai de Kelle," "thenanism," or low status," the ideal, is to think of pieces with princess and color stimulus.
(Laughter) It seems a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped and technological prostheses.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world, which is already in the décima edition, I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana, and I took the second place?
I?
Silvana ...
[A.DE.]
Adrica.
And many other people, many other stylists, but it was out there that the big companies, famous and designed brands, who realized the real need of this track, who are already launching inclusive collections due to the size of the success which was the first, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their inclusive collection.
We must all think about it, have empathy, look at others, the world that is changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal with our differences, thank you very much.
I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us there in California to generate these children, who are very proud, my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this real dream, to create this family.
This leads the life of the enriching.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
And we had two options: we could confuse, cry, or solve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and keep searching for an option mulla for finding it.
For him, I was able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and it was very incredible because all the school's most friends did a huge movement, sharing the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, giving medication, very incredible, was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, the first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message was ...
That when a child had leukemia and tries this of life, all the rest of fears and worries don't matter, everything doesn't have any relevance, really matters, and this doesn't matter anymore, or most important is life, the fight for life, and love.
And the third message he passed through this disease, the possibility of compatibility between a donor and a patient, is that in my blood, my osea medulation, the important thing that I transporate to this disease, or a living father, or a divorced mother, that embraces us, which is the same as all people saw us, deep down, we can build a family, a living father, or a living father, or a living father, or a living father, or a living father, or a father of a living part of me, for someone who has cancer from me.
Socking ourselves for this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, doesn't know how to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
It's called Laikon.
Please, for you.
The base is like you.
This is nostalgia, two slams.
My name is Palawa El Chinawi, I'm Syrian, born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
And an engineer I studied at Damasco University, today, I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little French in Portuguese.
That's why.
(Laughter) I'm sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Brocrancetto," which exerces the Slam because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with Slam.
Before the war, friends I knew about this child, I had my family, Syria was beautiful, peaceful, auscultory of engineering, two apartments.
I, a car in Damasco, and I liked traveling.
Until one day, my city of the mask was safer in Syria, the war started on March 15th, 2011, and I loved to meet the world, then it came to all the other cities of the country, and mutilated by a bomb, every day, it was very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, if my family would come back again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian, me and my family were very sad, when we had to leave Syria, I still lived there, I went to Bahirut, after ten months, and our life stayed behind, and I don't know if I lived them again, my father and my brother, because there were more opportunities.
And I had only one week to leave brains 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, the food that my good friends told me to celebrate my children's birthday, and they all said very well, today I have a Brazilian daughter, Sara, nine months, and I enjoyed the kitchen very well.
And making food to sell was then that I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) is the Talion of Syrian food.
And I make food and I take it to the rubber boo.
We're happy in Brazil, thank you.
The reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, Branus, Etrest, who, due to war and terrorist attacks.
Many people had a wrong idea about Syrian and Islam, today in the morning, or a journalist says to me, "I, after this happened in France, now I don't want to talk, or talk, or contact with a Muslim person, think I'm performing blood drop.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the French bread, but also Branuz, who is spreading Islam's image, or a basic religion, or the pocket, not only struggled book since he killed a person, without having killed another, all men seek, about the Tulmida, bescola, 32.
Men and women can't touch each other, just like my wife, ask questions like, "Why do you use this silence, with this heat, you use this heat, "ebata bem," "brob," some things accept, they don't respect the Muslims, "sonitá," but I've already seen human beings who do all that that they kiss and embrace, even with the differences of culture in religion.
When I left blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner, this isn't happening with me.
(Laughter) Why are these things made of Islam?
But in spite of not knowing Moislaam, after the Exibian Agency understands about it, of all our money for the people who need, every year we have Alsaacá, the savanks, black or Indians, or the perfect Mohama says that we should help the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if the poor are Christian, today.
(Video) And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
Zeus kids are sure that it was like to understand that a privilege of peace, now my dream here in Brazil is that the world knew their children.
Valbuder to grow together based on the cell item.
PC: In the short stories of life, I've come to recite my tears, because they don't hire me in the mall, I don't understand, if it was for an option, I have many friends who are in this situation, and they've already conformed, but I don't understand, and if you understand me, or the opportunity to work, cooking, cleaning, cleaning everything and washing the bathroom, and the bathroom.
From that moment on, when I compassionate, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family, she wasn't yet programmed to my surprise, in less than 24 hours, that was a reference to my last job, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom, and then I felt the need to create the page, so I took a day in the middle of my running life because I've always talking about everything I've accomplished, always talking about what I've accomplished, always talking about my first story.
And soon when I got home, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, books, even today, it was very expensive, maybe pale, I started to cry, there are domestics, going through these conditions, at 18 hours, earning 38,000 Brazilian reais, and I said, "What am I doing, I started to take a sheet, I was very young, I started to fire, I said, "Wow, what am I very young, I said, "Wow, I said, "Wow, I've been in this area, I've been in a lot of money, Regina's coming in a new room too, I've been in a lot of books, I've been in a new room,
And then, for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of "leading the carpet of the Brazilian traditional family," and, thanks to some teachers and several class friends who helped me, I summarize some texts, I try to go into the room to show that it's very difficult to apply, a job totally heavy with the studies.
Today, I'm here to generate adversity because I believe that only through the adversity, we can change some things, and it was known by the media of the time as terror of lords, all this when today, I came here to generate discomfort, and I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but no one will follow the path with a little stone.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
My grandmother was domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a photo and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, and I started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me, at least an interview, take a suspense, after graduation, I had a suspense of seeing my experiences, of having established this and that, and so on, you would say, "Yes, or I'm magical."
(Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that the biggest house in the past are domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past that doesn't have a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the housing employees today, the modern age is the coast of the employee.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to get there on Friday, and when I got there, I was already wearing the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was the maid's money.
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother was always going to work, there wasn't much time for her, but all the needs she had and she had suffered - I only wanted to see her marrying, because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because her modern senzala, takes her wife to work.
He tells his wife who's going to work, but he goes back home.
To woke up, and the only solution I had was to take pictures from all over the world.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can flee from his harassment because when I say that I'll change employment, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you gain 18,000 Brazilian reais per month, you'll never get this value in another place and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need this money, because modern senzala is the coast of the soup."
Because my saving poin is my peak, and then I was there, in this line of service, tired, I took my saving poin and made it in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the gate of grace and the bathroom, and there wasn't the employee bathroom for this reason that I brought the pot, because the modern vessel is the coast of the maid, today I'm here, contrary to the statistics?"
For some people, in my place, would be there in the faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for your family to serve."
So, you have to be happy, being able to come, so I'm here, counting the statistics: black woman, fat woman ... (Applause) (Cheers) Hiperipership!
(Applause) On my side, it fell fast, a woman to the teacher and peripheral teacher.
(Applause) I'm not alone here today, behind me, there are 6 million households that should be on my side.
So I'm here telling the money we don't have money, but only to see that six million households are being represented now, and that in other countries various domestics, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, because in other countries, why babies have to be seen as white.
(Applause) They are from African suitcases and not mandated.
Invisible can travel the wind.
(Applause)
(Applause) I'm here today to talk about silence.
What's already a bit funny about exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect: turn off your cell phones, don't photograph, until I'm dying of fear.
And if you were photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
Four years ago, I was imitated at a table, at a surgical center, and then I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When the surgery started, I felt a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop, he turned to me and said, "It's funny."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20; from the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize.
It started.
Audience: Yes.
Open the agenda, think about your eye, insecurity, equipment.
I propose inflammation points, the first step from the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered a quote from an author, he said, "This is the door of the entrance to a state of presence."
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When I put my foot inside this sensation, in this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're your human potential.
When I put my foot inside, guys, if you are a human being, you don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex, what I found.
It was fear.
It was very angry, very fearful, it was laughing, and it was a lot of frustration.
I found various emotions, various emotions, that I didn't know they lived inside me, they were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had lived was determining the way I thought, the way I act, was determining the way I perceived life, was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone, remember?
Most of you?
You just stood the man.
Several of you.
They thought, "No, I need it."
So now, I want other people to justify their importance here, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Listen to me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
The "deslige" comes this step.
It's not close to you to turn off, turn off your cell phones off.
And put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, back there, close your computer.
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you the external tool of connection, who connects with the human being.
Now, look at the stage, look at the later's walls, look at the ceiling, look back, look at the environment where you are.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
I said, "Let's look at the face this way."
You're good, you've got a little gun.
He was connected, guys.
Look!
They see where they are, they see.
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Close your hands, close your eyes, put your hands in your legs, your knees.
But now, with eyes closed.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born of fear.
In any man, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's a real fear of what's inside, a fear of this emotional map of life.
with eyes closed.
Well, this step with me.
Remember where you are.
Remember the ceiling, remember the walls, remember the dimensions coming to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system of the human brain: we're connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
And the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at that moment, a different part of your mind is going on.
knowing where you are and leaving the localization system connected, feel where you are, feel the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took your hand to hot chicken, to feel there's also a knowledge, and soon you learned that a little before your hand playing Chica.
Now, with the localization system connected and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space: volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Sit down.
Which brings the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
"No.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult, it's new, it's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
(Laughter) It's you who you are.
Look inside and explore silence is realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
We already know that in the future of the evolution of race, it's simple, direct communication between what I feel, it's self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process over 10 thousand years ago, last generation.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity to another autensity: silence is a source of freedom.
The TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video, (Laughter) which is usually a good first view, as it was my case, I can say it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so translators that the idea of translated, part of a demand of a TED formula region that asked for translations, shared fashion, their friends, their colleagues, their family.
Audience: Yes.
In Brazil, the translation work is fundamental, once only 5% of people agree with the protestal budget are 5% less influenced in English.
Like Lacona, yes, producer is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world, 10% of them are Brazilians.
Traduating to 116 young people and almost 6,000 translations made up until now, but we not only translated like these here.
The work of transcription is important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow people with hearing disabilities to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, as it's my case that creates Portuguese, first it's transcribed in the original language.
To then be verified for my time and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, in this case, TEDx with its own logotipo indicates, addressed only with technology than rooting, entertainment, which is the "e" that we can translate as entertainment, and design the stage to refer, currently the talks approach an infelity of subjects that go from the early.
Another of my passions, letting the things that evenxages the theme is this cognitive event, that has as free as we have, then we're not only part of our greatest expectation of life, but also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think the shoe that one of the uses I make in my hearing reception is to translate, not only because a pleasure to translate these talks, be a TEDx, or be a TEDx fan, or be gay, are short educational voices, accessible to have very small children, not only because mentor is an environment of the "dete" that can translate a passion, and the father isn't a boring ball in my life.
Not only because I have fantastic people, as I'm getting to know at this event, because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent in initiatives like this one, that TEDx.
(Applause)
The second is the philosopher, "Eddy Frome?"
A bugs appreciate man's hearing in life.
It's ... giving light to oneself and becoming what is potentially, that I don't have any doubts about education, it's fundamental for that.
And I also have no doubt that education is fundamental so that people, less privileged, with good crimes, or excluded to our society, can become in a dignity way in our society.
And when I think about volunteer work, I think it's a donation work, donate your time, donate your knowledge, or donate your time, my choice, my decision.
(Video) I have to do the best way possible and try to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces, the remains of our time, the tradition and complex activity that takes not only to know the same foreign, the source fight, or, mainly, our language.
And Lama Fox works by destination.
Because of a well-defined translation, there's always a wild knowledge that changes research, a lot of work, a lot of hours of dedication.
And behind a non-violent translation to be users to see, there's always a much worst distress than frustrated with the fact of what.
(Laughter) For the best they do us, they can always do the best.
(Laughter) Because the text can be improved almost indefinitely, and here I need to remember that the vast majority of our volunteers is not professional, and that is very important to decide, we'll go, the vast majority.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations, not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who will watch, right?
(Laughter) And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transitions go through a review made by the same volunteers, so they finally be taken by a black color motto or a barge coordinator, or as we call "Portuguese" in Portugal, which is very different.
And we have 10 NC, parents I'd like to cite here namely.
I read stories, we have EPM, we have Maricene, Cláudia, who I, have our guys, who are by flee, by Bernardo, Gustavo, uncle, uncle, and Rafael.
(Audience) Very well.
This obsession I have with education, in fact, has to do, not only with Brazil, that lives in a deep political crisis, where education is released the pan cycle, but not related to my own personal history.
My father, who has lost about two years now, if he had seen it, didn't take the primary school course, despite that, I knew well how to write very well and do the four characteristics in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond, because I had studied, and to make his four air aerial children in the cities we sleep.
In a road, my father was the false and absolutely lost everything. He was literally, without anything, because you kill your students with old mobile phones.
One felt very humble if I paid with my father's name, decided after paying his teeth, if he moved to Belo Horizons like mom in front or behind, to eat very enjoyed from the zenco.
The first horizon.
My mother, who is now 90 years old, isn't Arizona, besides being a Paráito's player today for a while.
It was an excellent cooker, he stood on sales, my hand, and she decided to squeeze for many years in my house, wherever she wanted, was literally, the smooth cake, say the passing of the largest peoples of smelling oil.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up, it was that we replaced him to study.
And that's how it was done.
A big question, without a doubt, because according to data from the penetration of national research for Mossios Domicídios, in the quarrel of 48 years, at 60 years of Brazil, only 32% of people in greater solidarity than a fundamental one.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
In the slightest days, my father, for example, had the habit of standing up when I was seven years old, at that time, we were a literacy at seven years old, who provoked me the way up, when the book asked my newspaper, full of gold to him, and to any visit that was coming home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, exchanging in words.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) Anyway, today I keep thinking that this should be the greatest route on parochia, and one of my five brothers we managed to study, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our children, much better conditions than the ones we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in the life of my public traffic, are my two children.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
In education, in obsession, we had to be obceived by education, in spite of the adversal conditions, despite developing our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has to do with the fact that TEDx inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these wonderful speakers, by TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
And we can.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, and she explained how she worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, and many times, I started writing letters from dots on my notebook, and we decided to create a clock, and, approximately, a month ago, we ended the clock, and encouraged us a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and encouraged us a lot to keep on this project because it's super-complicated, and we, we, ourselves, we, ourselves, we decided to create a report, we decided to create a report.
Suddenly, we saw that it's something that was born from our interest, can help with new inclusion, support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create. With this, we are committed to keep studying and researching to create an even bigger impact.
So, we wanted to show a video that our aunt, besides the time in the clock, the senses, the picks, and leave the message that many things seem very simple, they weren't created yet, and, if we, two students from high school, who hadn't even finished, in high school, we are teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help anywhere.
Narrator: Thank you.
We stopped asking you a question, "What do you think?"
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
You can put your hand in the air.
OK, we're all courted: two or more adults, free and consent, can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is an expression that is to perfect, the only difference, the main difference, with sexual relationships that dance commercial, is that it's a half exchange, or they have street thinking, and the other part with the objective of having pleasure, men and women, that manage their business autonomously.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children or adults who didn't make sense that consent is crime cases, it's cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In a child's sexual aggression.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is consistent, I also think there's a criminal case, and, always, stunned by voluntary and forced frustration institution, but to take all the people who do sexual situation, won't also talk about traffic situations as if it were all.
Research has shown that Portugal the traffic phenomenon falls towards sexual expulsion is not very expressive, there are phenomena that can't be identified, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, that Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and that, regarding the year of 2016, are the last available data, indicates that in Portugal were confirmed 118 victims of human traffic, almost all of them for sexual exploitation, just three.
Of course, I was listening to a single victim to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't mean is there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution, but many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims.
It's very ugly.
The explorers who are at something that expects someone to wrap well.
But this doesn't respond to reality either, or it's just another stereotype, most of the people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim and think they've made an option.
Of course, we know that not everyone has the same options, inequalities between rich and poor countries that do sex work, what they say is that this is an option, a punished option, after equalted to advantages and disadvantages, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but which is highly witnessing a disorder and not recognized.
If I ask you to think what is the image that comes immediately to your mind when you think of a person that prostituates?
Think about it.
Okay, and I can the majority of you have thought of two situations, or of any prejudice, or, therefore, a woman of evil aspecto and minissaia in a corner, in a dark street of the city, which is very likely a legislation and who, of course, has some plurality, but this is just two stereotypes, these are simplified images that don't reflect with rigority.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people, of practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory experiences, not just women on the streets.
There are men in sexual work and there are women transgender, not only cargender women, there are also many women with sexual work transgender, for example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Of someone on the street?
And I say that the studies that are powerful and defeated, the Western society, and try to estimate the number of people at the beginning of sex, indicate that the street presentation.
What would it represent us about 10 to 20% of the total of prostitute people?
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
They're less, they're minor, but they're not negligible for the study data, which was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by Lisboa's president and who interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of the inner, men, women, trans, and who, all over the country, found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8 percent of trans women and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even more high.
AC: In sexual work.
And I'm going to tell you about an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the detachment.
The idea that the people who are at the bottom of this law, since 1999, although it may appear an idea, apparently humanist, when we analyze the bottom of realizes that it has had very negative consequences for those who do sex work, and that is the idea of the client's criminalization, and that show that this law puts on a greater risk their own sexual wisdoms in Switzerland, Switzerland, stigma and disease.
Another idea we have is that all people who are in sexual work are victims.
It's an idea that I think ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between sequence workers or functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that leads to sex professionals.
So, if people can do this as an option, in favor of the clients criminalization, there are even countries with the Hondal figure that a sexual assistant is someone who receives training to know how to have sexual donations with people who have efficiency donations, and I think this example is quite clear about the relevance of sexual work and their pleasure.
What if people think for them is the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without anormal violence, anti-natural and XX-sexual, normal and natural violence, that divides sexuality into two types, if it can be controlled about work connections, why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And the fact that eating success is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is based on stigmatization, of decreidibilization, of devalorization of people who do this activity, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex consumers.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, with each fear I don't know if anybody has used this word, not TEDxBas, the puta stigma is the worst that can fall down on women.
The worst offense that we can drive a woman calls her puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: the honor and the disorders, the seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and this sport or bad, and, in this sense, the puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of the control of feminine sexuality.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called a puta.
So, why can we do any of us so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators and I think the path is the human rights of all included based on ideological assumptions?
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically depressed and fight against the end of their option, to challenge stigma, as I'm here to do right now, and to give voice, doesn't mean it, we don't want to compassion or tolerance crimes, we want rights, and that's what I think is the path we have to follow.
After that.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we should keep disrespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is bad.
But there's also the good news, we can cure it.
But, at the same time, I have to have such a distancing that allows me to have a very short technical rigor, a doctor, that I can look for, in the last ten years, in this relationship, a very delicate relationship, with all the most proficious and more reasons, that I'm able to suffer, the best treatment that I don't divine different from him.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white eggite, I thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
That involvement, that love, that response there, I came across a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed what I knew how to do and to be able to offer to that person what this required, the request of indame, schedule or schedule.
All the doctors who go with us and come back from there, inrochistan, and we bring to São Paulo, which we bring to another daily practice here.
The simplification that's going can be replicated here too, is the copy that she needs to go to the middle of the Amazon, which is all this, it was the path I found to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university, if you make a list of topics of students' goals, the first objectives are: altruism, even good.
Once we did it wrong, we picked someone who had a brilliant stigma, with the same research, in a short Medicine symbol, cure, bodies, assignment, and we handed some technical, poetic stuff, who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry about the Pacient medical relationship, a medicine that is pop, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before, when Dão caught the apple in Greece, which is the blessing in medicine, where the father, in medicine, remembers to the past, is what we do until today, hasn't touched the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and father of medicine, because for the first time he had a method?
It can transform the art of healing, something that can be taught, learn, reproduced, replicated, and give involvement to these people had a logic of poop.
That until today is used in medicine graduation, around the world, a fifth century before Christ, people on a door, please.
These are slightly complex words, you prepare three words here.
In all the houses I entered, I'm sorry to see the student's building, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, specially the sedution of women, men, children and ceremies.
That's why you've heard respectfully the life of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
Because it has to be transgrid, because the more patient's relationship is essential for a good cure, if I respect this law and not violate it, be ethnicity to go for a reputation between men in all times, and if I transvest the violin, in this case, I have the honor to participate in a profession that is registered for a judgment.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science in a way that the neighbour could go further, what happened to it, the knowledge, the doctor, who proved in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge, so now a patient has a patient's culture.
There's a current theory that says to the exam, you can talk to the patient who can't.
Once I was in a classroom at college, in the classroom of small groups, as a teacher, we'll see the whole barrier, and we'll see the whole network barrier, and when it's copied, the illustration, I'll put their hands on their belly and I didn't make their awareness at home.
He looked, "A Swiss pocket can talk a lot..." "The time you're mexing in the patient, because there's a moment of intimacy that he has, if he's constructing, caring for his own clothes, "A Swiss kiss" can say a lot, "Oh, when you're mexing in the patient, because there's a moment of intimacy that he can go to the image that he didn't tell you about at home, if all this was to convince you."
Besides, when you're seeing the patient, he's here exposed to calculating the vulnerable area, he's letting you move in it, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, that you're throwing him out, that you want to do good, him, that you're asking him well, they're for him, stop taking care of you.
This relationship, this magic, increases a number of functional diseases in our middle, the same employees, but the house we don't know why it appears, there's no option of exams, there's no ruthless changes, it doesn't see that it doesn't react, it's not only beautiful in Sofia, but it's replicated in science, because our society is a little sick.
Because if you're not going to talk to a group of mistakes, because, after all, the act of the relationship is very interesting, you talk about the patient's relationship, but it's a drug dealer, I'm patient, and be passive for those who are talking to me, some of you are already doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two habits.
There are doctors against patients, it's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we have to hold our hands, which was in our short-term process, but also, to develop their cure process, in the decisions of the healing sector.
There's content to say: today, a Google, you have a infinity of very good and very important information, but, many times, the difference is that, at that time, for you to know someone to publish something, which is a publisher, the first point, and the most important thing is information, not being fashionable, when you were children, there was a reading book on health.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge debate because people inside hear what I've done, and they allow me not to do that badly, because this puts me, just like other people who are defending personal interests, money, selling media or other things.
So, the industry isn't interested if you know that, and finally, get information, participate in your cure, so there's nothing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the internet and my more when I don't know anything about it, no one shares information, information correct, no one does anything alone, it's difficult, but excuse your doctor.
Secondly important thing to be a national article in the cure process is to ask, to exist, if it's not that, it's wonderful to know, when you talk about your doctor, or position time with time, we'll make sure that medical careers are different, doctors want to exist, it's not to go to a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, Parémontonhose, Ariel Mani, that we had a patient there, who had a penis cancer, had a tumor.
And there was no orologist, for us, we brought it to São Paulo, to be treated that in all cancers in Uber.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his trip, there was a translator, it was the son of the destiny who spoke very little Portuguese, as he was very bad, he was really talking to the gays, the doctor who obviously didn't speak German, and I presented it as a movie scene.
The polometric Indius, which is like this: "Ana, good pion," of the method was "pam" on the influenced.
(Laughter) The big thing to do with this is that, at that moment, the magic happened that individual without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture than that other individual had all the interest in taking care of him, this magic that wants the art of healing, so you don't need to care very much, a lot of figure happens.
And, in this moment, we talk, I'm proud to think that there's an average way of assessing in clinics and clinics in patient consultations, but to find more unity in our treatment, we, doctors, that this is not to do, because there's a connection, and the world will try to find better, and you'll be invented in Brazil.
Well, guys ... (Laughter) He talked about decisions that I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of reaching one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions. (Laughter) I'd like to talk to the world: 3.500 Brazilian reals, that was made with this icons magazine, and it makes more or less a decision every two seconds, and the person, for those who have to pay attention and talk.
A journalist presses the Servinho Circudois, which is a nature as digital, more printed, and also being winners, the respect of this first is that the majority of people chose as CFR52.
What I really like these experiments is that they usually have two groups for a second group, only two options were divided.
A digital option, 50 workers, and an option of how the institutors' process also.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I tell myself about this experiment, I wanted to think that this option changed the majority of people chose the new one.
This observation is even its name, it's a third one that is put in an equation, but instead of having two options to the idea, to influence this actor in a decision or another, and you want people to choose T. In other words, they are not less well in the occupation, and I learned a lot about it at the hotel.
This is impressive because I started to ask myself why all of this was in a talk that he made a comparison of these behaviors with them before today, and a TED talk that even made me understand everything, I think everything seems a little bigger than the blue cycle in the right.
What I have around me makes us see in a different way, because the truth is they are in the same size, there's another better illusion, which is what they do at the time of listening, but we see in a different way, they're equal to chess and low pieces.
That's when I look at and say, "Yes, now I have the Man's problem that I'm already all this, but I'll show you that it's true."
Without staying in the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
The technology work: when I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes sense to say that it's time to influence us from the choice to people, if the person was all pregnant, it would have these three or two, and we were working, and they said, "Wow, there were possibilities of choice, options, you can choose this person."
At that moment, joining this concept of icônios magazine, that I just realized that there are people who make the drawing of architecture of decisions where I'm making many decisions.
And this caught me a lot of version, in the world of technology, has even the name for this profession, called YOEX, which are the architects of the decisions, who work to pass the architecture of the decision, drawing all the format and environments in which all these dreams.
AC: Why did I stop this name, mine, if today he's found one day with this father, his face is him, he's kicked out, who's a burden in this subject of behavioral economy, and he was super-fastated, who was going to start with you, and the trick is really harming my grandmother to see and also behave.
When the panic and the rhythm comes from a person, when the decisions we make, take new networks from people with smartphones, get this smartphone for 22 hours, by close, it's Wes, it's that you can hold a hand, or that the orchestra gives us a decision that we make about it.
Chorus: Here.
(Laughter) It needs identity.
Talking about Idrogram, I should talk to you about gold in the best interesting way, (Laughter) But it's not strange, (Laughter) In this case, it's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, (Laughter) and, in reality, it's a number of 22 to two kilometers.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why do you have 99% of organ donors, because in Austria you need to ask to leave, in Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter without doing anything, it's the decisions I call birth capture, you have to go out?"
I was putting credit on my phone these days, I opened Uber, I was there as a lover, to get Q. So someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to receive, if you took the work, that they loved to talk to another person, when they got to another person's car, and they caught a strange and said, "OK, there's a Uber functional, I didn't want to receive the recipe, it's 560,000 results."
And what do we click?
(Laughter) Ninety and one out of five percent of people explained the results of the first Google page: Will those who chose a place we were eating people, I even Google?
After that, I love the page seven, and I see from there what is the page, no, I go to the website and click, "You're asking this."
AC: Actually, that's Google, Uber, giving us little pants.
AC: These guys, in English, have a name in the behavior economy, they also have a name, they are called "innatis."
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "Now I understood, and the concept of 'digital' is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these little pushers in the digital world, and thinking about what the 'dutis' is." (Laughter)
(Laughter) But it's not true, and in this talk I wanted to take a picture of me, so one day ... (Laughter) and that's it!
Audience: Good afternoon.
According to the things I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave, (Laughter) if you're thinking that only the one who falls on this is European from Austria and Detina Maca, more than four inscribed people, written by inserting themselves, until a person is automatically being the power of all their decisions, that you'll take in your life and ask to leave.
The manager is that people ask me, "Teacher?
By having this knowledge about these discomforts, these teeth, this can help us handle someone.
And my answer is that yes, as, for example, knowledge is a tool, if you have it, you can use to make someone buy something that they don't need, or you can use good, to make a diabetes patient know the moment, and be so insulin.
NJ: Yes.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this bonet, the same highway, which makes the metal wave to detect a kilogram to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, there's an event that happened in 2016, that made people from the world descent 144 billion steps, which I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world, what you imagine was the launch of Pokémon Go.
And I believe that if we understand better how these behaviors work, how these nans work, we will be able to build a better world, more and more we're immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, thank you.
