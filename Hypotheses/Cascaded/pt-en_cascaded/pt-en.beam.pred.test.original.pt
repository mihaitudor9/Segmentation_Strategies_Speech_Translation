Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference or should it have?
My role as an inclusive fashion stylist, is to create a room that embraces all of us, people with no disabilities.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final graduation work, and one day I went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head, and I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion, and they told me that yes, all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes, one, two largest numbers, take them to the sewage to make some foreigns, and that made them lose the fall of the play.
They were happy that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work of these conversations, it was this: to make clothes the conclusion that I arrived is that this lockery was really necessary for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It's one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I made her a pack with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort, I made a hyper-descrete to make the exchange of the probe which is very used by those who use wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the actress of the skin with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities, and I asked Carlena a bullet that had opened on her shoulders, with a closure of pressure button, to facilitate her time to pass her head.
In fact, for people who are quadrietic, the ideal is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who will dress the person.
And paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress on their own.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And on the other hand, I made a very ergonomic way out.
I've already done it in the sitting position to give more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress she could use in many ways.
From top to bottom, up to top, reversible.
And I wrote her name to remember him so she could identify that the play would be the one used during the day of the desfile.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in arms so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
And, for women, with anism or low status, the ideal is pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, the "edkle," "thenanism," so they don't need to find the ideal clothes, they are born child from the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with disabilities.
This means more than 23% of the population, according to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news, lighter materials, stamped prosthetics and are producing more modern products, such as colorful and technological wheelchairs.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world?
That's already in the décima edition.
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
And many other people: Silvana, the drum, small brands, several other stylists, are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was outside that the big companies, famous and designed brands, realized the real need of this dressed room and are already launching collections.
Like the American woman, who was already in her second inclusive collection due to the size of the success which was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
The world is changing, people are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But that in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore, because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest, was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Listening to four years of age, to adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community, we started working with the said.
And I was awareness of people, how to collect every day.
Knowing how to separate one trash from another.
So I tried to talk with the children and it was making awareness of my father.
The parents who were staying gave me the children.
People recognize me in the community.
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
And I go with the children I know.
In my community, we have a seed collection, when we go to the forest, to work with this safety.
We have a plant where I met a plant called Hengar's name.
It's a leguminous plant that we plant everything under it.
It's a plant that recovers the fast or the soil.
And all the plants that we plant under it, we have a good result.
And our community, when I went to the armp, I found out that all plants were used, each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
I had to imitate forest, because there in the arms, there was a lot of plague that was giving in the plants.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them variating, there I have the aaiu, the cup, graviola, Andyroba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná.
And it's all there, there's no plague.
Lightcom, all natural there.
At EBRAPA, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
Keep by side, without comparison to ours.
In our community, we worked all with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxic in our community.
I associate human beings as an animal.
The child compared her and how only to pay.
You talk, she's there listening, and then passing on to other children.
The HI top was watching this attention.
Then he talks about the quote.
I compare the child like this.
And to deal with your human being, we have to be patient, we have to show love, have to have affection.
"Mom, the poorest thing for those children."
So, I looked for my knowledge and was putting everything on the axis.
My father says, "The first lesson we have to pass by someone has to come from us."
So, I'm a person who always walks around, I keep observing, I'm a person who observes my house, and I saw that my wife, she always likes to be everything, things don't exist there, everything is fine.
So, I saw that all this that my work was doing with children, who is the future, would work out.
And today we have a job inside those far from the atom.
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children.
For those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tortoise of the Amazon.
We work there and started with my son, today we're giving 25,000 children.
And we're collecting the river, that before there was a hoolig in front of us, just like the little of our community.
She crossed the river and ended the river.
And today we have the people who saw it.
Today, in our situation, a very happy situation in which we are able to live with nature, understand nature, and I always liked forests.
So I came to pass it to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about forests, for those who live with it, for those who feel, we breathe a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest, is always talking to people educating children and going with other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small, that I'm like this: "When I'm in the community, people arrive and come to get closer to us, we're talking, awareness people, and I'm very happy.
So, I'm like this: if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I feel even guilty.
Thank you very much, guys.
(Applause)
I'm gay, married with the name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California to generate these children.
They're very proud of my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this reality dream and create this family.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
And this puts the life of risk.
Imagine all the most and parents who are here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
And we had two options: we could confuse and cry.
Or to solve, fight, believe.
I was strength and kept looking for an optical mulla, so that he could be able to make a fear transplant, what he needs to be cured.
It was very incredible because all the school's most friends and all the new friends created a very big movement, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, bringing people, donating blood, donating módulos.
Very amazing!
It was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us.
For us and for the rest of the world.
The first message was that when a child has leukemia and has a risk of life, all the rest of fears and worries don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
We learned this lesson and spread to our friends, to the schools, to societies, people on Facebook, telling the truth, it doesn't matter the problem I had, it doesn't matter anymore.
The most important thing is life.
The fight for life and love.
The second message he had with this disease, public and all this movement of finding a donor, was that people saw us as a homosexual family the parental man.
And, deep down, doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to have a family?
Or a living father?
Or a warmer divorce?
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, that gives the strength.
This gives life.
This is what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that I'm transcribing has passed through, with this disease, to the world, is that my blood, my oxygen, we can manufacture them.
Our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
Or a human being can give to another human.
Tankède raised this awareness.
We have the capacity to donate blood for those who need it.
And Sammy isn't that for someone who has a house, doesn't go out.
Sandia if it needs births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all benches are needed.
Hydles, if castrate as a donor of oil, the chance of compatibility between a donor and a patient is one out of 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you were winning the old gift of life.
You can save a life.
It can be a hero.
When I crossed myself, "Oh, it was a very beautiful moment to me.
I'm waiting for them to call me to save in life?
With no effort, no pain.
This is donating a part of me to save a life.
It's a nicer thing.
A message that, the tankède, passs to us all.
I'm grateful to all of you for supporting us, for this union that we are not feeling this unconditional support, I'm not to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate módle to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's called Laikom.
You looked at it.
Basically, it's like you.
This is Slam's exaldaation.
My name is Talal Al-Tinaü.
Her Syrian was born in Damasco, the capital of Syria.
In January, I studied at Damasco's University.
Today, I'm a refugee in Brazil with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little in front of the Portuguese.
(Laughter) Excuse me, without a few moments, it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
But I believe there is SLA because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with this.
War signs, Syria was beautiful, peaceful, cheap, and easy to live.
The population was over 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child, two apartments and a car in Damasco.
I liked traveling and I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started.
March 15th 2011 in Draa.
Later, it came to all the other cities of the country.
My masco city was the safer of Syria.
There were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
After five years of war, men and the country are destroyed.
People I know were forced to carry on, or their children's left-handed shoes, they found their periphery and mutilated by a bomb.
Melhiities joined and didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
I didn't know if it's going back home when I left to work.
My family would come again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have lost everything, they're dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we bars and our lives remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still live there.
If I'm going to come, they'll be again.
Barabroteger, my family, I went to Bahirute.
After ten months, Brazil had opened the doors for the Syrian.
So I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassad and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil because there were more opportunities.
You had only one week to leave your arms 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and he was very much.
Today I have a Brazilian daughter, Sara, nine months old.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate my children's birthday.
And everybody said very well: the food that my good friends.
I'll take advantage of the well-being kitchen and cooking to sell.
That's when I created "Dagine on Facebook" or "Doing with Syria Idea."
That's why now, everything has pen and paper.
In other words, a number ... (Laughter) And the maybe eats like this.
(Applause) I make food and I send you WhatsApp.
(Laughter) We're happy in Brazil.
We thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened the doors when the world was closed white.
Etresschi, because of war and terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian and Islam.
In the morning here, a journalist says to me, "I, after that happened in France, now and I don't want to talk, or contact with a Muslim person."
I think Islam likes blood that is allowed to kill in the name of religion.
But exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not to support French.
Also for us, or for the Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image or a basic religion.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since a person kills without killing another, the measures, corruption, a land, and as if all men were killed.
who reads life, will be how it deduces life to all men.
Alcurão, heal his life, seeing dark, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even with the differences of culture and religion.
When those of you came, a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that covered hair, just like my wife, ask questions like, "Why do you use this heat?"
(Laughter) Do you use this lesson at home too?
Jabi's lens today read other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, kiss, sex, only voice, wedding.
Some people told me, "But I've already seen some humans who do all this."
That beat is the hug.
Look, how slam they have these rules, more than each person wants to buy or not.
It's clear, it prohibits some things to be the same way the states that don't obey everything.
"Tanta bem" is not allowed as pork cane in alcoholic drinks.
When I left blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol or if I had sex with more than a partner.
This isn't happening to me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because these things are made of isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, although we don't know Moislam, after we explain ourselves, people always understand and respect.
Misterrama says that we must respect all religions.
That everyone has the same value that we must have with everyone, it doesn't matter if they're white, black or indigenous.
Well, it's good since we should help the people who need it.
Every year we have Alzacá and we give two dots five by five of all our money for the poorest people.
Not the company, if the poor are human beings, crystall, today I gave.
I invite you to learn more about Islam.
And I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream, here in Brazil, is that the world knows better or Islam to end "Obrecent."
So, my children, your children will be able to grow together based on it.
What is Selha Mole?
(Applause)
In the small life storytellers, I've come to recite my tears, in the spring sun, prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not realize the roots of those who always expect to reach, who believe always reach, I don't believe, my salary ends, just like this race, study the girl, what they said, but I'm here, I don't understand myself.
I don't understand that, if you take me so much to pay a Secretary course, but you don't even get into the office,
Sorry.
Like there was an event between them.
To clean everything and wash the bathroom, days pass by, months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation: DEO, ME, is to yell and be a maid.
If it were for option, I have several friends who are in these situations already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas: please, mum, it gave me an opportunity, and the mum said to me, "You follow this corridor, go straight, turn to the left, enter that little room that the vessor is expecting, be welcome."
I only wrote poetry in 2011 and I'll tell you why I wrote.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page "I'm a maid," the page I created on Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and that's it, this year.
She hadn't even completed four months yet.
And how did I create this page?
It wasn't programmed at all.
I was on vacation house, due to daily rush, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life, and I stayed there in the couch, remembering all I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach's topic, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And, as I use Facebook, as the daily one, I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, "Menine, can you do everything on Facebook?"
Yes, mother, it's my new diary.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
So I warned people, guys, I remembered some stories will start to bet on Facebook, and I'll use the ICR and the maid, so that this case, other people have already gone through this, compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote.
I'm always talking about the past.
For my surprise, in less than 24 hours, this went viral very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first story on the Internet was a reference to my last job as a maid in the city of Santos.
This is in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook, and my boss prevented me from feeding my own food.
I had to bring the container, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
In her house, there was a bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
This person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionated this first story on the Internet, it went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories.
I think I thought I would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I interviewed several media, both the international media, counted on the national media, London babies, German TV Dábio and many others.
I was very surprised when I talked to these reporters, and saw Skype that everyone, all of them got very moved when I started talking about domestic domestics' situation here in Brazil.
And then they managed to rebuild and I started talking about these stories.
Why?
Mostic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
Viticies are more valued, they earn for hours, for hour, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive advertisements of employment advertising that I tried as abuse announces.
For example, an ad that I read was for the worker and working second, Friday, at 8 am, at 18 hours, earning 380 Brazilian reals.
Every day?
Isn't it?
See?
Much less.
Both.
Reals per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions yet today.
There are domestications that are being prevented from feeding together and they also don't earn food.
There are domestic practices not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities I've always mentioned on the website.
But, during these seven years, there were many stories of oppressions, but in a single house where I found something I call humanized treatment, Regina.
Soon when I got home, I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a room that had a gigantic library.
I've always liked reading, but, even today, books are very expensive.
And my mom, my catheter father, couldn't buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started stealing.
This became a daily practice.
What did I do to get there?
I used to play at her house, pulled everything quickly, left half an hour to clean, to roll, right?
It was sitting down committing me to those books.
And, to my surprise, Regina comes in the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And knowing the experiences I had experienced in the past, I was very nervous.
Then she sat there with me and said, "What are you doing?"
There, sorry, I started to pull my leg here and I saw there was a book.
I needed it.
I was very nervous and she said, "Wow, you're interested in studying."
I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher."
Since I was a child I read a lot of books, I want to understand the history of the world.
Then she started to show me several texts that, in 2009, when I went to the university, I got to read at the university as well.
So, this is what I call humanized treatment.
In 2009, it was very difficult to apply the university with the faxines.
Because I entered the university, everything was resolved.
No, I had to pay the monthly.
And, thanks to some teachers and several class friends, who helped me, summarize some texts, I try to get into the classroom to test, which is very difficult to convey a very heavy job with the studies.
And then, for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the cassette of the Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery isn't over yet.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool.
But, there existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, in the 60s, created the first union of domestications.
And she was known by the media of the time as the horror of the ladiums.
All of this, when I eat and exhibit some reports, people say, "Wow, it's really heavy."
"Yes."
Today, I'm here to generate adversity because I believe that only through the adversity we can change some things.
No one will follow the path with a little stone, right?
Because the majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 79 addicts 6% according to the deese of 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a job like anybody.
Yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother was a maid.
My mother was a maid.
And I was also a maid.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
And I couldn't understand, but she already knew that everything she had spent while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, and I started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview.
It was just a shock, after graduation, OK?
I took a suspense to see my experiences, to have established that, that, and so on, and you are?
Yes, or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause) And I always say that the biggest house in the past are luxury apartments today.
What were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant past, it's coming from us, it's the domestic employees today.
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous of what I was waiting for her a long time.
"You're a payment day."
I hear her entering with a car, the noise of the key opening the door.
Wow, my boss came.
And when I got there, I had the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me.
Then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was so stressed.
Wow, I forgot to get your money from Monday, I pay you.
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and care.
Her mother would always work and didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there.
I just wanted to see her marrying, just that.
But, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to wedding.
But, as I'm deaf, I put my best clothes, I went to the church, I stayed hidden and I could see my little girl getting married.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
It's Christmas, I'm seeing my dress lady's family, everyone happy.
And sadness knocked me, because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss will work.
He goes to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who's going to work, but he goes back home and hesitate me.
The only solution I had was to remove copies from all over the world.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I'm blank.
And that's how I can flee from his seats.
Because when I say I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Menine, take 18,000 Brazilian reais per month?"
You will never gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting because I left my children in Northeast.
And they need this money.
What the modern coast is the maid's money.
I just arrived at a new service.
Try my tiny glass pot.
Because my sailor poin is my pnic.
And then I was there, in the way out of the service area, tired, I picked my saving poin and made it in number one.
And my boss saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the sovereign gate?
If I use the bathroom?
What is this?
What's happening?
No!
Can you use your bathroom?
In the other homes I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the maid bathroom for that reason I brought little.
Because modern coast is the maid's breast.
Today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people, in my place, would be there in the cleaning lady, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are."
To pay attention, isn't your grandmother domestic?
Only the mother wasn't a maid too?
He is already predestined for his family to serve.
So, you have to be happy, to be coming.
So, I'm here, Florian the statistics: black, fat woman ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Black woman, fat, black, black, beautiful, beautiful, and rich.
(Applause) On my side, I'm not here today, behind me, there are six million houses, who should be here next to me, and at some point they will be there.
Everything I do, I would run that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money, but just seeing that six million households are being represented now, and that many of them aren't watching me, but they will be able to watch, because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke at that moment.
Because everyone here must have many patterns, many patrodes and some domestic ones.
If each of us takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
What in other countries, many houses, work and study, and here this work of domestic has as private property.
We can see in the airports, "Why does the nanny have to be dressed as white?"
Is it an uniform?
So, to be able to identify it, and they are inside the house.
Does the player know she's the nanny?
It's to make it clear about the places of some people in this country.
I'm here with theory in statistics, I'm not alone, I'm talking about six million households.
(Applause) African waves and thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
It's already a bit funny, exhausted, but the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you, in my talk's time, first to disconnect.
Close your cell phones, don't photograph, even because I'm dying of fear, and if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable yet.
What is silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Some may say that silence is a door to who we are emotionally, because who we are emotionally is who we really are.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who's useful.
I was shitted at a table, at a surgical center, and then I was doing the eighth, the conceptive surgery of my eyes, she, on her shoulders, I was all very inflamed.
When the siren started, I felt a lot of pain.
The doctor applied another anesthesia, and then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco, it's very informed, anesthesia won't take it."
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20, from the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize.
It began, it exposed the inflammation points, the first passing through the bisturi, having their eyes, opened the agenda, equally.
At the time, the pain went to the next book and I was sure that I wouldn't realize it.
In the midst of this chaos, I remembered an author's quote.
He used to say, "This is the entrance door to the state of presence.
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When I put my foot in this sensation, in this moment of presence, and you're not the consequence of what you have in front of you, you're the moment when you're not human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put the candle inside, guys, what I found was fear, it was angry, very fear, it was a rudder, and it was a lot of frustration.
I found various emotions, various emotions, that I didn't know they lived inside me.
They were the consequence of the history of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had lived was determining the way I thought, the way I act, was determining the way I perceived life, was determining my choices.
Now it's little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you just kept yours.
Many of you thought, "No, I need it."
Others justified the importance of it.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick it up.
Because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this space.
It's not close to you, it's off.
Close your cell phones, put them on the floor.
(Laughter) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags, the floor.
Here, you can close your computer.
You, with the lettuces connected, close them.
And you who were noticing notebooks, closed their notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected.
You took as close to you the external tool of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now, look at this environment where you are.
Look at the walls later, look at the ceiling, look back at the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
A bubble in the face of these youths.
You're fine, right?
Keep up to a little kiss.
(Laughter) He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where they are?
Inspire.
Do you see?
(Audience) Yes.
Isn't it?
Audience: Yes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, with closed eyes, really closed, some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that's born of fear.
Any man isn't the fear of this guy in front of you.
Even because this guy, right now, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
With closed eyes, give me space.
Remember where you are.
Remember the walls, remember the ceiling, remember the dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, in Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we are connecting a natural and subused system of the human brain.
We're connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong direct center, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
And in the knowledge of your position, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At this moment, a piece of something different from your mind is caring.
knowing where you are and leaving the localization system connected, feel where you are, feel the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took your hand to a hot chicken, and soon you learned that a little before your hand touched Chica, you felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chicara.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected and feeling where you are, you observe yourself.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume, the area that you occupy inside this room.
And then, you realize the occupied area, more than that, feel what fits the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
"No."
Nothing.
It's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, since it's new, equality, it's new, as it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside and explore silence is realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence, it's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become on the planet along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available are simple, but they are last generation technology.
We already know that in the future of the evolution of race, communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect, because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity to another authenticity.
Silence is a source of freedom.
I breathed.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video, (Laughter) which is usually a good first view, as was my case.
I can say it's an absolutely hard tradition.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated, part of a demand of a TED formula region that asked for translations, shared fashion, their friends, colleagues, and their family.
In Brazil, the translation work is fundamental, once only 5% of people agree with the "prodestinal" apartment only 5% or less has an influence in English.
As it goes like this, the translator is the key that enables us to have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world, 10% of them are Brazilians, translating to 126 thousand translations made up to that moment.
But we not only translate, but we also transcribe the talks made in events or these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world, but also to allow auditive people with hearing disabilities to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't giving English, as it's the case of Portuguese good, first, it's translated into the original language, so that it's added to me and the English is that it's translated to do more languages.
Initially, TEDx with its own logotipo says, "The bond only as TED technology, "Intrortinely," which is the "e" that we can translate as entertainment and design to the stage to refer to.
Currently, the talks address a inferiority of subjects that go from sedents or scouts, politics, businesses, benedorship, even literature.
We have, for example, talks that embrace chances of chance, others of my passions.
And by testing what "disages" is this cognitive accident.
It's that it has resume that we have, then not only for our greatest expectation of life, but also the reduction of the human work journey throughout history.
I think the fact is that one of the facts I make of my productive president is translating, performing and realizing how one of the talks in the TEDx's environment.
I do this, not only because I have fantastic people, as I'm getting to know at this event, inspiring people, not only because I think it helps me deal with my care, I'm a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the book that is both a privileged sector, not only because translating is a passion and a passion.
The second dangerous thing is the microphone of light for itself and become what is potentially.
I don't come from Duo de Educação, it's fundamental for this, and I also don't have any doubt that education is fundamental for this, so that less privileged people, a good of crivileges or excluded to our society, can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask for volunteer work, I think it's a donation work.
Whether it's donating your time, donating your knowledge, or giving an object precisely by your volunteer work, because if a choice of me, a decision of mine, I have to do it in the best way, the place and I have to commit myself.
To give the time that the wind is different from donating the pieces, the remains of our time.
Translation is a complex activity that takes not only to know the foreign language, the fingerprint, but also, mainly, our language, and takes sources, that throw stone.
Because of a well-defined translation, there's always a single knowledge of a month, a lot of research, a lot of work, a lot of hours of dedication.
And behind a translation like this, fluent, pleasant from it, there's always a much worst distress and frustrated by facts that, whatever you do, it can always be improved in almost entertainment.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional.
This is very important to decide the reason: the majority.
But, nevertheless, we primate for the quality of our translations, not only about the speaker, but about those who know, right?
And to guarantee this quality, all translations and transcessions go through a review made by the volunteers themselves, so they finally be taken by a "ordinector," or the coordinator of a barge, or as we call it, by an energy.
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, where we created Portuguese Portugal, which is very different, we have ten NCs, the parents I'd like to quote here.
I read stories.
We have IBM, we have Maricene, Claudia and me.
We have our boys, who are how I was from my boyfriend, Gustavo, tunnel or historical and Rafael.
Very well, this obsession I have with education, in fact, has to do, not only with Brazil, that lives in a deep political crisis, that education is employed by the panic cycle, but without having my own personal history.
My father, who has grown two years now, if he was living, badly estimated primary school.
Nevertheless, I knew how to write very well and do the four mathematics programs very well.
His dream was to always be able to study language because I'm studying and make the children study.
That's why he who was living in translating from our June called "Tairobeiras," decided to change with his four children at the time, I stop many slaves, the biggest city than our boys.
In some places, my father had come from the start, his logic, Uberas, and his place also established with the merchant.
They had a small hotel from a presence store, they had versions before.
However, in 1964, there was a great exception of Brazil.
After this compassion, and other reasons, my father went to Valência and lost everything.
They stayed literally without anything.
We say that, without anything, we have serious mobiles.
They felt very humiliated about their plague with my father's name decided after paying his teeth, if they moved to her medicines like mom in front of you, going back, eating well and enjoying.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who today has somebody for years, isn't from Joana, besides being an astero in Jogos Parágua today, because of water, it was a cooking exceptive.
training sessions: my mother.
She decided to take queijo bread to live.
So, for so many years, at home, a bunch of queijo was literally win-paid.
It's a passage from the worst pains of queijo for two years.
So, despite not having to eat, many times, not having to dress in one thing, my father didn't open our hand, it was that we are explorers to study.
And that's how it was done.
A big question, without a doubt, because according to data from the package of national research for lunch, householders, in the 46-year life franchise, only 32% of people in greater solidarity than the fundamental one.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently in smaller gestures.
My father, for example, had the habit of standing up when I was seven.
At that time, we generated the knowledge of the state of 200 years.
The body just thought, left the dozona's file, got a prize, and any visitor coming home.
You can't act, right?
There I am entering, exchanging in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest spantalized in parochia.
But for my father, they saw themselves laughing, nanning.
Without knowing, they were living a little for this talk here.
Anyway, I, my five brothers, managed to overcome it, but we got more than that today, we went to give our children the dreams of better than that we had, right?
And here I talk to my greatest passion in my audience's life, it's my two pounds, myel, that João Nik, whom I never put snakes to give me the newspaper, but to whom I made a matter of all the nights, stories before everything else.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincidence or not, almost all of us, my brothers, we become teachers, education is to be a doubt at some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the educator without a mark, for me, fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies in the students' education at their own school.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to educate for obsession.
You would need to be "men" segmented by education.
Despite the living conditions, despite developing them in our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives with TEDx has to do with the fact that TEDx, just like my father, in such a simple way, inspired us, despite all, we can.
(Applause)
Because our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where it can feel the things that are written.
(Laughter) During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they stay how they worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super-conplicated, we're forgetting this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots on my notebook and I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a ticket, which is a little that allows me to write in Braille, in which you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook and my schedule of lyrics, film names.
I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that threw me up, in which I wrote to her that I was learning.
No, I gave the tips.
And with that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started to research, thinking that there would be thousands of processes of this, they would go online, and it would be ready to connect with the engines, and we would have a clock.
But he saw he didn't have the Internet.
We decided it's our own.
She started researching, learning about robotics and programming our teachers, and trying to create a clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaking and nothing happened.
But we did it all, collected everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock and showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us.
They tried to continue this project a little less or a translator in Braille.
It was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we study that it's something that was born from our interest, can help with inclusion and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my best you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the period of time in the clock, meaning, eyebrows, and leave the message that many things seem very simple, still weren't created.
And if even we, two high school students who didn't finish, in high school, are second, and we are teenagers, can create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help.
(Applause) Thank you, thank you.
(Applause)
Let's ask you a question.
Who thinks the adult person in a free and consent way can have sexual relations with other adult people?
We can't put our hands on the air.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults in a free and consent way can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance cross-functional, is that it's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the objective of having profit and another part with the objective of having pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business autonomously.
They don't pay their ads, they receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or street thinkers, and they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm not here to talk about cases that involve children or adults who are cooled.
Small that involves under 16 or adults who didn't give sense to their consent are cases of crime.
There are cases that must be chosen, criminal and judicially, and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution, but about sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case.
This is important to distinguish between voluntary prostitution and processed prostitution.
It doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse it by institution against sexual exploitation.
But to take all the people who do prostitution through traffic victims for sexual action is to confuse a small part as if it were a whole.
Research has shown that in Portugal the traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive.
These are phenomena that we identify ourselves but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I've just told you about, which Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic, and which, regarding the year of 2016, are the latest available data, indicated that they were under drug traffic in Portugal, 118 victims of human traffic, almost all for work exploitation.
Vitimes for sexual harassment, just three.
Of course, I was listening to a single victim to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't mean is there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There is an image in a very historical way of presenting to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, as victims, defeats, asturated, who are something that expects someone to save them.
But does this also not answer to reality, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider that they are victims and they consider they had an option.
Of course, we know that not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, such as gender inequalities, inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of buildings that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with the people who do sex work, what they tell me is that it's an option.
It's an option based, later related to advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly witnesses a disorder, and it's not recognized.
If I ask you to think what the image you see immediately in your mind, when you think of a person that prostitute, think.
Okay?
I bet most of you thought of two situations.
Or in any prehuman, or a poor-speaking woman who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, who is probably very likely to be a parent, and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people in sexual work.
There is a diversity of people, of practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, they are not just cigarette women.
Also many transgents of sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped, when we think about prostitution from someone on the street, I say that the studies that are made, and the Western societies, and try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of a prostitute sex.
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
They're less, they're minor, but they're not negligible.
Data from the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker muestra.
Directed by Sonha Dias da Universidade de Lisboa.
Milly and 40 sex workers, both in the street context, as in the inner context, men, women, trans people, and that all over the country.
They found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage is treated more elevated.
So, when the speech does about the victim of a man or a depressor, they forget that it's a percentage of men who are in sexual work.
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, detachment, and that, although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when it analyzes the bottom of realizations that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999, that it's not prohibited to sell sex, but it's crime to buy sex.
The idea based on this law is that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception.
So, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there have been very strong evidence, namely non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse and indicate that this law puts on a greater risk the sex tastes and that increases its vulnerability to violence, stigma and disease.
Another idea we have is that all people who are in sexual work are victims, it's a fantastic idea that, without great inspiration in ants, the resources of people, people's speeches happened well.
And this idea that the client has a criminal, for an idea that seems ideologically biased, until because research has proved that the lessons between sex workers and their clients are complex relationships and that, mainly, are not abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of cooking the customers is unfortunate.
They're the people who have disabilities or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who recruit sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities have the right to their sexuality and their pleasure.
And many of them, the person can run to sex professionals.
There are even countries with a cool role, a sexual assistant, who is someone who gets trained to know how to have sexual equations with people who are disabled disabled people.
I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that has destroyed any argument that aims to be the favor of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option, if this can be done without violence, if people think that, in the other workplace, why do we keep condemning so strongly the people who do sex work?
What is stigma so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is because of morality, and specifically morale, sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
The side had a sexuality and considered legitimate, normal and natural, and, in Portugal, we have a sexuality, is considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural, and that's where you have sex commerce.
The fact that this sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of decreidualization of sanction, of devalorization of people who do this activity.
stigma is a mark with iron a profound delivery.
The stigma that rejects sex observators is strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes.
stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers.
For example, when they drive in institutions in the health area, justice and social security and are treated with prejudice.
I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone used this word, not TEDxBas, the puta style is the worst one can fall on a woman.
The worst offense that we can drive a woman calls her puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and honor, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and this one behaves bad.
In this sense, puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality.
It's a sort of sword of bitterness that's on the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that's disappointed, norms that are socially restricted, there's a risk of requering a puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
So, what do I think we can do any of them, can we do so that they don't keep on disrespecting sex-respectors?
I think the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence.
But it was already discussed here in the morning.
A scientific and empirical evidence, and not politically built from ideological assumptions.
It's also recognizing this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fighting against the end of this option.
But challenge the stigma, but I'm here to do right now.
And it's to give voice, to listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been one of the most attempted attempts of silencing over time.
Sex programmers are around the world organized and we use 70.
But, precisely because of stigma, your voice has no credibility, they are not heard.
As it was said, we don't want compassion or tolerance crimes.
We want rights.
That's what I think we have to follow.
After all this, I think it makes sense that it's natural and to end, that we should continue to disrespect, stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But there's also the good news.
We can cure.
Art, well cured, art, healing, being a doctor, is supported by a fundamental stone in the doctor's relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to spiritually engage in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual, that I have compassion, that I have empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can provide the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationships of our time are all more superficial and more reasons.
And vice-ebalance is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors were also there several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white elite, I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear India.
India, my uncle.
And on the last side, I found a feeling that I wouldn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed my knowledge to do and to be able to offer that engagement, that love.
There, he extrapolated all the doctors who go with us and focused on getting robbed.
And we bring São Paulo education that brings us to our daily practice, that the simplification that correl can be repeated here too.
It's the mouth she needs, and for the middle of the Amazon, it's for all that.
So, it's the path I have and why I want to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you give the student's list of topics of goals, the first objectives are: altruism, where's good?
In these same students, in the symbol of the Medicine Grupo, with the same research, the bodies of the statement of success is knowledge, cure.
When we did it wrong, when we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic stubborn, and we handed a technical person who knew medicine a lot, but there was nothing else.
The worry about the Belgian relationship with the patient, with medicine, is going back to the past.
Gréce, the fish in medicine, where the father of medicine is, who is poor, doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
The Adão world, in Gasbo with the apple, Eva dresks wood, and that was to go on a leg trip.
It's what we do until today, it doesn't touch the same thing.
(Laughter) So why is it considered, instead of finishing, because your father isn't taught?
The first time, he gave a method, he can form an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned from the first time, that reproduced, replicated, and so that the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion too, it was uncovered, it was created a few-year-old duration which is still used today in the medicine degree in the world.
It was a status of 50 years of crisis.
But now there are slightly complex words.
I prepared three words, in all houses that came in, I just spoke to the patient's benefits, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and the brain.
For art, what you saw is respecting the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince them to be shared, to keep this snacks as a religious secret.
If I respect this law and not violate it, it would be the dignity of equality and reputation between men in all times, it existed to bring the violent rotation that happens to me the opposite.
Why, already in high school, if I occupied this, and still today, do you dinner?
We do judgement of things that we thrive because we have to be overwhelmed, because the medical and patient relationship is essential for a good cure.
Today, few things are taken by the judgment of one.
In this case, I was honored to participate in a profession that is rigid for oil judgement.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produces science in a way that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this?
Medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge.
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team, why is it?
In some class.
And this group, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we'll specialize in healing this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam, you can talk to the patient.
You can't, no.
Sometimes, I was in a class at college, in a class of small groups, as a teacher, and I play with you, "Look, patients have aography, resonance, in two pieconomascopia, the illustration.
I'll look for their belly hands after facing awareness.
"Oh, I'm less posed.
Each called me a little, called my class and said, "Let's see the belly like this."
He looked and had to hit the patient's finger, telling what was smoking and saying he didn't smoke anymore.
Each five of them showed that they had emagreced.
Men of the skin.
And how old you can see if he is able to take care of his own clothes.
A dirty child can say a lot.
When you're using the patient, you'll have a moment of intimacy, if it can remind you of something that he didn't tell you in the practice.
And he said, "If all this didn't convince you, besides, as you're seeing the patient, you're here exposing you the vulnerable area, sometimes it's letting you move."
At this moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, to be mexing on him because you want to do good there, and you're asking for this so-called man, let's be careful with you.
This relationship, this magic isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
And children go to Christmas, which are taken on their lap and are caressed, they improve faster, and they have the most precoccupied evil.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment.
Juntos work, it's a house where we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery operation, there's no anitâneas change, no routine, nothing.
That's what we have symptoms.
I said, "Does it happen because our society is a little far away?"
Some of you have already raised your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the patient's relationship.
This is a prepacient medical relationship, I'm a patient, and to be a patient is to be passive, to those who are talking to me.
He'll tell this to a group of doctors.
The actor of the relationship are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
My doctors, after all, two.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive and passive.
And we have to hold our hands, which was our cure process.
And it's not just going to look for healthy life.
But also, to engage in their cure process, into decisions for the cure process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
Not where do we like to talk about Dr. Google, the fashion guy?
It's not fashionable.
When I was a child, I also had a broom in the market, "Yes, it's useful."
I had a book, a health book.
I only existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor - you had to have content to talk.
Nowadays, like Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them are very good and very important, but many very bad temples.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information was greater because the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we have to think about this information.
First, good sound, usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1% of people live in my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge call because people inside hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and it goes for me for nothing.
Because this tells me, "Look, because it puts me, because just like other people who are defending personal interests, making money, sharing games or other things like that.
So, the signature.
Second important thing: they didn't believe in good basic things, in violators.
Look, medicine has changed.
Now, your problems have over.
Usually, the nursery.
Differently a lab with the scientist will have a rewarding and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, nobody does anything alone.
So, there's nothing you've discovered today, and tomorrow is on the internet, and my more, when I don't know.
It's wildlife.
The third: if there's a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
Are you a bombing?
The fifth middle school.
And, hardly, there's another exclusive interest back.
So, for me, this isn't for a prison.
Lastly, ask for information, talk to your doctor.
Is it there for that?
Inform is equal to knowledge.
Inform is information, it's knowledge.
The information actively participate in their cure, but it disculates the costume.
The second very important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves, without the right to know what risk in that surgery.
It's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me."
I work 20 years, so I know I have time.
This will change the day to night, when I have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there, fighting with everyone, not body teachers, it's not that.
It's, vagarly, knowing how to exist, how to compose.
With time, we're going to make atendments different.
The method you want is this?
They want to attend the right.
You don't want to have this attempt, like the name now, they want to deal with chaos.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, there it was human, and we had a patient there, that he had a sneak cancer.
It's a man and a fish.
And there was no speechologist with us, brought it to São Paulo, and it's been treated by all cancers.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation.
The doctor who obviously didn't speak was human, didn't speak Portuguese, was an eye.
With a translator, he was the son of his fate who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad, he was completely scared.
And I presented a consultation that, for me, would give a scene from a film.
The index, the oromometric index, you say, "Ana, poup."
The doctor was, "Dad!
That's it, OK?
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to be for this, is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual, without being the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, delivered his soul, that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art of the middle to heal.
So, I need a lot to tell, a lot of figure.
It's true.
At that moment, we talk, I'm proud to think, there's a doctor to be performing in prototypes and in ambulants, curating what you're seeing.
So we, doctors, can try to find more unity in our most compassionate treatment.
All patients try to be creative in their cure process.
Why is it not to do this because there's a connection?
It looks at the world, but it's better, and you'll be more treated, all of this.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
You can see, guys.
Audience: Good afternoon!
I wanted to start with the world here: 35,000.
What does an artist number mean?
This number is the quantity of decisions that human beings make daily.
And it makes more or less a decision every two seconds.
And in Bestor?
In the whole world, in Origs, these animals have a decision.
It seems it has been to pay attention to the talk.
He talked about decisions I wanted to tell you about, with a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my way of making decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this rigoring magazine.
All the signs of the magazine had three emotions in this nature: a digital structure with 50 friends, a printed magazine structure, the Serveninho Circudolais, who was a master's degree and who was a digital people more printed to also be writers.
The result of this medicine is that the majority of people chose how you are 25 dollars.
What I really like about the experiences is that usually there are two groups.
For a second group, it was only an exhibition of two options: a digital option, the 52, and Oxando do Combo with the 80 reals.
The first interesting thing is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When I wanted to talk about these experiments, I wanted to think that the solution in the middle of US$ 15,000, he launched the pride, that nobody chose.
What did this choice change most people choose today?
And that made me very uncomfortable with what I wanted to overcome, and I would make that decision.
And I started to study about it.
If you need to know this, I discovered that this person in the middle has a man.
She took the ticket.
It's an option that is put in an equation to influence this Dr. They make one decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in my theory called Economy and Computamental.
It was in theory that discusses cognitive psychology and God, and this is the application made of decisions.
There's even a formula, alone, interesting, that you can use, but instead of having two emotions of the idea, and you want people to choose their hearing.
You're already able to see the occupation.
This is her third queso, it makes her a baby, it seems to be better.
For those who will pay 122 our company, I can have two at the same time.
This is the company at the time.
Because I started questioning myself about it all, and a talk that TED even made me understand everything.
When a talk he made a comparison of these behaviors with illusions that today.
I think everyone seems in the context of Union.
The cycle of their users seems a little greater than I follow in blue of the right year.
Please?
Because I have around me, it seems we can see it differently.
In fact, they are in my job, but we see it differently, because I have a way back from the cycle.
There's another optical illusion that I was fascinated by coming, which is the one that the legs of the xadrez on top are equal to the low chess pieces.
A moment of life that will make your problem before reaching all of this.
It shows you that it's the same: without putting on the pieces it's just editing the bottom, we see that they're really good.
When I see this presentation, it's better that I understood it makes some sense to say it's around us.
In the same way, what is around us to influence the way we see things, what's around us will also be the same as the majority of all the decisions.
I work in technology, and I didn't know what was working on a project to create an application to see certain people.
You just did this for inscription, right?
It's a lot of option and a whole series is explored.
You can choose the two adoptions, the three or these two, and at a certain event of insecurity, we were working and saying, "Go and other possibilities of choice."
And when he worked working, the voice was cool how to simplify this choice for people.
This way, she was verified with the profession.
The person came back to Floripa, and she'd say these three options: it was at that moment, gathering this concept with the concept of "flons magazine, that the person came back from mechanics and took these three actions, and that caught my attention.
In the world of ecology, there's even the name for this profession.
It's called Ox and the Everestrians' experience or the users' experience.
But exactly the people who are the architects of the decisions, work to pass the architecture of the decision and draw all the format and environments of all the decisions.
As incredible as it may seem, my friend of course, finding one day with this guy, his face is him, he is the person who is a burden in this subject of behavioral economy.
He looked at this photo and said, "Look at what I found you're not old."
I told him about these theories you have to bring the knowledge of the behavioral economy to the digital world, and he said, "Your Majesty, I'd like to start with you.
I believe that the judge will have a vaccination and it, what changed my way of seeing is also behavior.
I think we have a research to know that we use the cell phone a lot.
Everyone here is already a long drug dealer in their pocket, or outside their pocket, or looked at him, but I arrived at a research, for example, that he was a little bit a little, and this curte, and this curte is that you can add it to my name.
So, thanks to 35,000 decisions that we hear, how many other authorities are digital decisions.
In these places, it seems we're daring my digital family, or that the medicine believed many times, and I'll look at these not with us.
I started to ask myself, "Will I go to UFRJ to take a lesion like I am?"
Will everybody change the success of the path we will take, will the child who begins to act isn't the success that William's name be?
How many decisions we make and great dealing with the power to the digital world to take boring?
It's the country, it's Google, (Laughter) that's the problem.
Talking about Dougramas, I should talk to you about another interesting way.
It's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata it's Equada with C.
Well, time came and I started to think that was it and said, "Where will the magazines be?"
(Laughter) Go there and it's not strange.
In these rays, it's my number of fingers and Europe.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why is it that at the top there have 99% of organs pain?"
What tells you, that you're already one of the worst.
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a little more word called Tefol.
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call the decisions that capture birth.
You need to ask to leave.
Someone is already far from the drawing to you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my cell phone these days, and then there are two options: one to receive the recipes and another to receive me offered.
The Greeks were dismantled, the offers were killing.
So someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to receive it, that I went there and wanted to go out.
I picked up to get out of the offer and signed out of the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, there was a bitter to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave if I was really in the people and I even thought it was cool to meet someone else.
I talk a lot with Uber's driver.
Take Uber those drivers to talk.
He decided to open a time and tell a story, and a lady chose Q when she got to the car with another person in the car and she woke that weird and said, "Take it like this.
Is there another car façades?
He looked at him and said, "That he chose culto."
She said, "It's curious.
(Laughter) I chose business without even knowing.
She chose because she was already chosen by her.
This is very complicated, it's very interesting to imagine whoever makes these decisions.
If we go to a Google today, to research where they eat, it has 567,000 results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from someone was me even Google?
After that, what can I do?
I'll go there and click on the web page.
I love Jessé.
Then, I see what's on the website: "I'm on the website 7," and click, you're asking for a samba.
(Laughter) In fact, that's Google, it's Uber giving us a little bit smaller.
These emphas, in English, have the name in the behavior economy, also have a name.
They're called inequality.
I didn't have a little push in English.
I'd like to ask you all to go over a line, people next to you.
The guy needs a painting to see ... (Laughter) It's an ecology.
Is it?
So, this is Nage, do you think?
We have a theory of an author called "Britateler," he has a book called Dante.
And the concept of Ditoland is the name I gave to a simple way of understanding these pushers in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood it."
I thought they were useless.
(Laughter) But it's not, right?
In this talk, take a photo of me cutting, see ... (Laughter) You're thinking that only one who falls on this is European, Austria and Detina Marca.
Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
In the midst that a text written, "Are you introduced, TEDx from a person, you're automatically reminding the power of all your decisions that you'll make in your life, something explains."
Yeah!
(Laughter) If you don't want to receive it, it's easy to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
More than 400 inscribed people, 13 people were making money.
So, this means that I make all the decisions of the lives of 300 and 70 conversations.
No, this was just an experiment, this is one of the things I do.
I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I motorize the results.
People usually ask me, "Wow, to have this knowledge of these little aphids, these teeth, and this can help us handle someone?"
And my answer is yes.
The danger and this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you have it, you can use it, you can use it to make a diabetes patient, like, for example, know the right moment that also sublines.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this doll called Smartphone, which mediates brain waves to detect coxilo to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
There is an event that happened in 2016, that made people around the world descent 144 billion faces.
What did you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
(Laughter) Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone a concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better how these little troubles work, how these nans work, we'll be able to build a better world, we'll build better interfaces, and we'll be able to be more conscious for us to take better decisions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
