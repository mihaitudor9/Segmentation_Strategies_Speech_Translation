(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed by the way I portray their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox.
Our children are what we have of more precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our lives for them, and, however, our children come from very maltratized to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, which is what I hope to do with you today: if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which are most of us according to Mandela's critics, we are a terrible character, because we deny them with basic letters, such as health, housing, education, food, food, and if they rebel themselves.
We offer her prison, but even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here, we offer her.
The thing also doesn't work well: we may not commit more sincere crimes, I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll take it...
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Gabriela's mother wants a natural birth, here is the moment of affection link with her daughter, to receive with her husband, this baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal medicine, and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessable.
I remember that, of course, there are necessary cests for each one of these sines that we'll be, a highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces C-section culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is in dangerous, dangerous, for example, Rio de Janeiro, 93% are made.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, telling reality here, you can take that a refrigerator, a formula like this, in front of a grandma, the case of her, needs to be hungry, she goes to the most insecure house, her grandma, her mother, and, "Are you alive, are strong?"
The child is crying, so he's weak, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms, they awake.
He quickly expelled, and the breast milk is money, it's breastfeeding, but industries make the advertisement directly to the doctor, his marriage, convinced of his dynaminations and congressions and sponsoring integrally the medical society, which end up unconsciously being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil, and he, unfortunately, is superior to any of these forms.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the license, she'll have to go to the crew because she can't take care of vovement.
And she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, she'll get home, her parents are tired of tired of a long day of work, of sponsorships, and they'll live with her daughter, there's still a job to do at home, in the weekends.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay a maid, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar, crocantes outside, all the weapons that the media tells us to give us intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of being at home with this person, with our precious children, with our children, and us.
They can't.
Because they're scavenging, and this brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploiting in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, and we get healthy food to our children, it's no longer so healthy because it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we're world's world consumption champions.
And, however, in our urban lives, they don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to let the child leave, go home, stay at home, we'd play personal games, it was an incredible moment, so today, two babies and two states for each of us, if we can't do something in the car, right?
(Laughter) Even in the moments she needs the most about awareness, that's what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this does, Gabriel watches four hours on TV per day, she's massacrated by advertising, she's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because we have less school time.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the stool, the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family in the weekend, which is...
Very well, where it will be massacrated by advertising, toxic values, toys, care and brands, according to this love, and that instills in values like an obsessive consumerism, the hyper-ralonization of the appearance.
The utility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, will disagree, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, not people, this peculiar of the mercantilization of childhood and child consumption.
Cabrela is full of commitment, because her parents want that be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises, to relax this stress, they add a classroom than meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, the wonderful thing: Who has never meditated in balance?
Look at the sky, look at the floor, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, "Merudization, look at the floor."
That uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, meradization, which is based on sexism, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their minds completely when they're eight, ten years old, this sin in the authorization of the end in childhood and erootization for almost because it doesn't live with it.
She gathers a lot, if what she needed would be presence.
She realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, with two or three years old, that realizes that parents don't have authority, we need people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms, we know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, we need to give to our children and we are losing this capacity instead of that.
They don't have life experience, so they don't develop ways to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, and certainly everybody will deliver them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the superpower in childhood: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, birty, and will get sick, will eat too much, it'll be obese, it'll be ill in school, it won't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about this: it's not possible for these children to insist, in the same way we take these poor children and put the solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, not, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well.
Going to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in truth.
The medicalization of today's most direct phenomena, you can see that in the United States, 15% of children are now getting pregnant with this competitive and individualistic society, what the factory that is producing is exactly medicine.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, just like medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and imperativity.
It happened in 1999, 70,000 boxes, and I'm sure some of these geniuses, in humanity, had today at school, it would be exactly this, rooted or nomatized, and we'd have sympathetic her genius, we'd have lost that wonderful thing that the trouble boys.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, ways to change paths, and problems are very complex, and I don't see this without any end of sines and factors that self-alimentate each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
Obviously, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And, in relation to time, what we can do, when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today means weight payment in almost all the churches, what we say is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, which is our sacred, what we have more precious today.
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's a seven-hour point that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes, this gives a bigger and 40 a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's only to priorize, and, if it doesn't happen during the week, we start with a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
(Music) How would it be?
You can open your eyes, tell me if you fit in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure that most of you, yes, this shows little the importance of nature, it's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, it's all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience. I started that, with Patricia, back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!"
I talked about the convergence to auditability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
Everything that causes health well does the environment and vice versa: riding a bike, does the body well, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transport for a long time, reduces the pollution, with my organic production, makes the Earth well, makes the animals good.
Things always go up slowly in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it will unleash us from the fabrics, it will give us moments of awareness, especially for children, who will know each other, and learn how to deal with them, we will develop a cycle, free events, gourmic spaces, and not only the initiative of artists, reivindicating for this, that make us connect with the public space, with the public space, with nature, love, affection, affection, affection, affection, affection, affection, affection, affection, love, affection, love, affection, with love, with love, and affection, books, with the books, with the books, with the books, with the books, with the green, with the affection, with the books, with the books, with the books, with the green, with the affection, with the books, with the books, with the books, with the books, with the flow with the green, with the books, with the books, with the affection, with the books, with the green, with the books, with the books, with the affection, with the books,
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocupaque," practically used for resistance and citizens today, it means to occupy public spaces with joy.
And, mainly, taking part in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as it happened in São Paulo, where you're seeing here, in a photo of Represa Billings, a source of water from São Paulo, 30 to 40 years ago, and today.
In this mago-vernance and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, imagining public policies returned to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
To conclude, the same scientists, who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, that's coming here, will come very early, our children will pick me up, and also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing the inequality of what we already know, with transparency for the compoundation, and there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre.
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking kids outside, families, already outside, we're going to the city, we'll take the public steps with the game, with play, and we only defend what we're doing, so, in short, this is our proposal: children, already outside, bringing children to the park, to now, to the confinement, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others, and we'll reduce inequality, entertainment, with participation.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so that the utopia works, exactly to not make us walk, that it makes us walk outside.
(Applause)
In 2007,
I came across a great group of young people and adults with disabilities.
Listening to regular education.
And since then?
What's my biggest challenge?
It was to look at the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project called "Café terapêutico."
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a truly inclusive society?
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion within school.
With his parents, with his son.
And with my partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities -
Sometimes they're left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
to have friendships.
to feel like acting with people.
Here is the case of the student Igor, for example, who in the other school he studied?
For four years he didn't get into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
And people didn't have the strength to do that either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education.
And since he loved running, he ran all the time.
GG: T arriving isn't a clean field?
I sought to know Igor in a global way, I sought to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school.
And what together could we do?
So that he could ...
They achieved better learning.
The school?
A paradise was a place of despair.
Well, you already know it's a pulimpo?
Today, he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
And I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And you can teach the student to heal.
It's learning itself.
The schools think -
That they are not able to assist these students and that they are not prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
I need to use and believe that these children are capable and that they are inside the school.
To do well for them, it'll do good for other students, for the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
Why is the choice like that?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know and what we can learn together.
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years conviving with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view.
They survive with people so they can see it.
I learned to value my legs, living with people who don't hear, I learned to use my hearing.
Or those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart.
And the heart of my students: to create connections and bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
What about learning?
It's an exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
(Applause)
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook.
When I was little, I loved seeing my grandmother, cooking ...
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Páscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
Food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine itself.
So I decided to study a little about "yurveda" and macrobiology, because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
To build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Trossé is a bit of life ...
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can connect with nature.
(Applause)
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
Food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's to do it.
To restore the food system.
Changing the food dynamic, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces, the cheaper it produces.
Worst is quality and...
The animal's life cycle is artificially accelerated, and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated.
He ...
He loses, he begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies arrive an hour that doesn't end up, and he begins to lose, decrease dramatically its quality of life.
Your health and your life time, so ...
I believe we can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilogram, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex, right?
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very... today, Brazil is the world's biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount ... (Applause)
And I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep polluting this abuse, in use and consumption.
I wanted to understand why, but the answer is because our current society.
There are inverted values because a person concerns for a change of values.
And don't buy a failed perfume because they think there'll be some alertical reaction because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what chemistry there is inside.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, the more you buy, for example, a pill of leface.
It's a bit of organic leface. You're paying not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that behind that leface, there's someone who took care of all affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think - right?
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason...
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption.
It's also the way we consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in São Paulo.
If I take it and see those executives or those precious people walking down the street, speaking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because also, but arriving is something people think it's a waste of time, but actually, I'm sure it's very scared.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for that same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, claping, watching TV, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little jewels, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo-duriaçúcar," which are the three floods, and they end up creating a dependence not only physically, but a physiological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products are too harmful, I don't even call them food. For me, they are made up of food, because you can even consume, if the website does, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorns, panickets in the place of microwaves, look...
This question - (Laughter) This might seem these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange bread's popcorn for the microonds' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you'll be consuming.
I think that the chemical consumption that you wouldn't put, I'm sure, in your panick, and you're also polluting with the packaging of microwaves, of a packaging that could be a trash in the world.
It's excessive of industrialized products, it's really pre-gudicial.
So, to summarize this question of the production process, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not sweet, it's not...
You're not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook...
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, cooking with independence, bringing high, health.
self-knowledge brings autonomy, brings safety, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you ...
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, or fallen dog.
What about a pizza?
(Sigh) So I believe that we ... and that's the discipizza, because not even pitch we know how to do more.
(Sigh) Oh no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean? Where is the beijão rhythm of each day that filled our belly and our soul?
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think that making food is very funny, it's very anti-personatic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold beans, at night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with the street and the little box you do in 28 minutes, the legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal, this would perhaps be the same time you'd take to wait for peas to arrive.
Spering or delivering of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
And elderly, boy, girl, child, adult.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children, bringing the children to the fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
There are many people, I think it's from the supermarket shelter, so the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent from the industry.
Fharmaceutical because they'll be much less sick, growing up eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change.
The dynamic ...
In food, we have to change our own - I.A.
Our value we have with food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating more.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Education ...
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose the food well?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Life is not the one we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My torment, Mario Güeyce, was the first blind planter.
Tlavora mechanized in Brazil, here in the land of Butiá.
For me and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, he got married with my father, and after having had seven children inside them, my mother.
I arrived in this world, by chance, was yesterday, but, at 50 years ago, it's the stories we tell, that make us who we are and by containing them, we transform ourselves and those who listen.
And it also transforms, we want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history, before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored, all stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to live the mourning, and I know it helped a lot of people too.
So having told this story about contacting me brings one of the most beautiful things about it.
That is the power that people can, when they feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously somebody ...
Come on, you'll sit on your lap of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had already been very small to me.
So I started to do this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx.
About entrepreneurship with purpose, something so uncomfortable for us.
Because that's what he've always suffered -
And he wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with them.
But I do you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints with the right, about everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, to be to keep complaining about who did that with us?
And if not, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can take responsibility for who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who understood this, started changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
Also, having seen that the root they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell him a lot of people's story.
If he welcomes me in his story, the last week, he sent me a big saying ...
That many boys have been looking for it even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that he wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that I didn't have any shame.
So, tell stories to me ...
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm bringing a lot of people to be here.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Tell something funny shows your children's pictures, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of "Ave," the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, and he researchs listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day, two weeks before everything.
From his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what has generated with this, every time you talk to me, you say, it's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk about listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was listened to, when he needed the most, when people suicide when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many discussions, oratory, writing courses, but who is worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to change, we're afraid to change, although the most spoken word here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change, but let's change.
There's always this fear, and, like this fear, we always get there and say.
I won't even listen."
What about us?
And for others.
And the listening ...
You see, also, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy.
But we don't have one minute to look at each other, to come embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) But this, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various stories I heard, out of all the others.
(Laughter) What empathy too, I learned collectivity in the street, many of us say, on the street, that we don't have anything to give.
When they ask us something...
We have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and we tell, that make us be who we are, and when we listen, the other of truth, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation that was this process here for me.
I was outside my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do art. Many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me ...
And for everyone, I came from a poem I myself wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
From the fourth of flaws, salas, values, the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
To show them faith in life, faith, in some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change the right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds of non-profit, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Liberation of fear.
I wanted many people I know could have, at least, one minute of rest.
Then they could look at their side and then smile again, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is, on Earth, being told to me, that I don't belong to many spaces, where there are all sorts of stars and stars, they don't have labels, they belong to their plurial spaces, there is no sterileaging or dark, ugly, rich and poor.
It's only legacy to their existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed over my life, a phase in which I was denied the right of just being.
However, I don't look for acceptance, from the moment I recognized myself, but, in respect, and the right for life, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, when she was born.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, that is acceptance, empathy, the universe was infinite, and, along with it, there are millions and millions of stars, but none is less important than the other, the universe is that on Earth and the stars already in the sky?
It would be a very bad experience, if we lived in a society where we were all equals, so, that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different, we learn new stories, new narratives.
So, I want to ask you a request, I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
While starting my transition of gender, laughing, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in that process the bathroom, for me, was a doll ball, it was where I could be the same, it was where I questioned God the reason I was different.
(Laughter) But the question is: what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and it was denied for me, well, the bathroom turned into a best friend, he was always there after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to put the ball on my head and dance rebeldes, because I've only been back until today?
The best, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple: the fact that I'm different; from then I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, for lack of information?
And when it's about the trans universe, this even more difficult path, I've researched on the Internet, but let's see people like me, during my 21 years old, more or less, I started to see friends of my transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me, I already want to turn into mistakes too, like this, everyone will come, so I think and start thinking in the wrong way, which is to mirror myself in the other.
So, I started looking for my true decency, and I started to get tired, because of this process, it has painful phases, and, if you're a black, fat woman, and, if you still have to learn to deal with other people's not acceptance, it's as if you enter a couple, spend a time there and leave this in a beautiful athlete.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But play, are you a drug dealers, our new thing? There's no traffic faces, no, you're fased, people, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years old?"
Is there any hall here who wants to live such a fifth and five?
While a man cites, he has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chance to die of being murdered, more than a man exiggered, and, second, if we compare with the United States, we, Brazilians.
Being a trans isn't an option, but, in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's no one... I take a calder and a little force, resistance, 35-year expectation, there's no one who was still like that, that we could better measure this panel, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a way of deconstruction of ideas to establish on me, after I finally found who I was, explaining to you how I transded my life story, explaining to you, how my person proves this, in an immensity that exhibited this novel for more than one million people in 130 countries.
(End of video) (Applause) It's a great responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be ugly to all that I represent with it.
But as I did, abused, I went there and gave my name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "It's a comment book like a man who's capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What has no price ... (English) What has no price?
(Applause) (Cheers)
What doesn't have a price is this message from mothers from other trans girls, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
Because you see me there, and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
Three, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm much beyond that, I'm much beyond that, but, to understand this, I have an unknown post, I really need to understand that we're many, we're plurial beings, the agreement differences, in which you should distinguish something that can definitely change the world.
The sky ...
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was me, a loved one?
Inmensity, freedom without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
I don't look at myself anymore, I can't stop, I've already gotten away from my courant.
In the past, only what's left are the scars that mark my soul.
But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want, being next to me, now I am, now I am, I'm going, I'm going, I'm flying, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I couldn't often explain to children what was cancer, what was treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarium sixth, that doctors called "teratoma," one of them once said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, you won't take a sixth grade."
(Laughter) Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
(Laughter) I got courage, I had never been hospitalized, so I had nothing in the same village that I stayed with children with cancer, and I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
Then I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's been a visitor's pain."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
I cut only after the bedroom, I was with cancer, metáses, and committed gangs, I said to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, not when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website, and the only thing that happened to me ...
Because the information certainty, at that moment, was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
which sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "c cancer"?
And I was a doll ...
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were there for years to help me, and from that moment on, I realized.
This information from society, for them to donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, the danger it was for them.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with this I went to see many other information I thought wasn't the most suitable.
(Laughter) When I entered the hospital, a doll, I asked you, "No, now I'm the same to you, I've got cancer, the children said, "Wow, you've sewed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
AC: But the games were overwhelmed and the kids started to talk about many things and tell about the procedures, when I went to...
Putting the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, I did the first porvey, I received a hospital kit.
Here at this kit, a sabonete came, a base has a seed of teeth, but also a shampoo, a towel.
And a slope.
I had no hair, (Laughter) And that for my information, and I started photographing all the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent kids to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We started playing, but we think that children don't understand, they think they don't know, they know the name of chemotherapy, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try to not talk to protect them, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, what they'll find.
That's going to fall our hair, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it kills cells that can be doubled quickly, but not only the tumour cells can be doubled quickly, but also the hair cells, they could still say, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to add a catheter, you can come here and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have the two legs." "Ah, but then, the profits come running." "We'd spend a lot of time listening to what we couldn't understand that doctors would talk, normally those who do health information, and my creative friends, and we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, but with the patient approached the end, what we've done at the end, what we sometimes like when someone else.
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there are Portuguese, they were, but we have a translator, and what is very asked in northeast, because children and parents are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do, with that we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit ... So, what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when it's events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
(Laughter) And that sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, discarded, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at BBA website, that this montages, and what happens with it, and when you're the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship, and you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "My daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take her to the hospital to see what's difficult.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that in this room there was a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see and father with a good life, and when we need help.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
(Laughter) We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, because we think it's very important: I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
(Applause) In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because dependency here gives me a disease and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the quest of this that we thought of several things, and one of these defense is in our brain, that can protect itself from great threats, the barrier kills cyphalic, although it seems a complicated name, it's a group of cells that are in our arteries and brain veins, and that make bacteria and non-violent substances don't enter our brain, don't do bad for our recompense circuit in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by cells, anticorposs, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
(Laughter) So you realized that these people who used drugs, so, couldn't we join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours?
To produce an anticópe against its own drug, it's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) I and my team.
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enters our user, consumes drugs, this tiny molecule connects to a large and pum molecule, isn't going through the kitchen barrier, do you speak?
And look at this image here how this process is beautiful, once we were able to immune them, receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was stopping, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior, as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they stay stuck inside the box or more inhibited of what doesn't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
So, what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people gain freedom, we believe that this treatment is the therapeutic vaccine or the antidrogas vaccine, it can be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for those who have chemical dependence.
Maybe some time with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide, a time to gain new freedom and ...
To discuss with themselves, if they want to use "no use drugs," thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
A scout.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to tell you that...
Besides.
Danorose.
Besides?
In psychosis.
There's a tennis disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infileno, he loses, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
An atrogen of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
From this big meeting?
Thank you very much.
It's here.
No, music is being ...
Toting from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some meditation.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Maybe it's an example?
The most deadly.
What?
For lunch.
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
Danormose in is the location.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that not always the norm has existed...
It won't always exist.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times...
What do we live in a context?
Where it predominates -
Violence ...
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dishumanity in its word.
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This is adapting to a sick system?
And keep it?
I've been.
A worker?
More than 31 years ago.
from the International University of Paz.
Or Unipas.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thegnancy.
How many wars ... There then, that comes ...
A bit of payments.
What military for peace?
But with other guns.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes...
The person should, that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of...
from a family shell.
When is my daughter Isabela?
Today she's 34, and she has a 8-year-old boy, she's five.
The mother asked me,
What princess do you like most?"
The ballet sheet, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought...
And he answered, "What?
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
I left.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
(Laughter)
Sometimes, because it is sensitive to feel in your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
That "normotic" don't feel them.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests...
And these people have experienced being desertified.
I respect a lot.
Dominated people.
Psychiatrics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy.
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a paragaia that captures.
The contradictions...
Culturate.
Sistenic.
And sometimes they haven't loved it.
And how did I say that?
Singue?
The difference between the ...
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
He will never do it."
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call ...
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here, Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, told me...
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
He's stupid.
It's the target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
What am I wanting for you?
He earned lunch.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, as ...
This fabulous team that organized this meeting ... (Applause) And nothing against correctness.
(Laughter) At that moment, we have to suffer from unpleasantness.
So ...
Have you talked about norms, machismo?
From racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions...
"Moramose!"
We could talk about the norm, is it environmental?
The girlfriend does.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, (Laughter) who is a cut salt, takes the fire, and each one is looking at the least, takes me and doesn't realize, their existence in the sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about...
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe...
It's a concept.
In this education, which has also been ...
Very good.
How do I feel a solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
of the wish it brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage like this.
It's because we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just by a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would offend.
So ...
A foundation of norms?
"Yes ...
The Situation took place.
It's another one.
Very important.
It's an evolution that has also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Yeah.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I think of a friend of Ui Paz.
An alternative Nobel Prize, economy?
From a developing country, Mom Fred Max, Life.
Chinen?
When I met my illness, he told us that, since he was a child, he wanted to know where the human being was different.
Of the other species.
Intelligence: no, it's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
One day, talking to his father, that world, respected him.
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
Chorus: Here.
(Laughter) It differentiates, for example, of the unbelievable, who sends a little light, and says that it's become the first estupidologist, stupidology, a science that we need to study.
That's absolutely...
In Denoa, I like to remember Rolentur.
And he told us that we need to be a great brother, a creator of biodiction.
The hipotalic stupid, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest Bral?
The question ...
It's stupidity because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly clear.
It worked.
To have diplomas and universities.
Olympics.
And to do like a person talking about development?
with graphs, branches.
Suphisticated?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, closing.
So ...
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had ...
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
It's human stupidity.
And he agreed, "Yes, autism, in relation to a universe, I still have my doubts."
But I need to say that I agree.
From Einstein and Maxleyphing, although they don't spontaneously.
And considering that...
Of the norms they are pointing not to the species's characteristics.
Human beings ...
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
It will be said.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's completely.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, split, you've ever seen and go to the sea?
We don't.
Are we born unpleasant?
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or...
(Laughter) Are you helping?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems to be necessary to develop a rational demonstration.
It's just about...
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
Emotional intelligence, unirical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Do you accept it?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted wasn't that day anymore, the borders.
For justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you change clothes.
And five thousand, I'm led to be a whole existence.
It was to change.
How do you think?
And this is the task.
In that sense?
A nursery ...
It refers to an evolutionary intervention.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: it was the 21st century?
Is it human beings?
Nothing less than that finds this paradox.
I don't fire everything.
From new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Give didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being ...
As Tiaxatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know themselves how to be, to smile, when to come.
Someone prohibited the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
"Fureci."
Maybe there's only one way.
To talk about the mystery of the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially!
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to "nonipas".
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned with us about this story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was incendiated.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flow.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
I was playing in the middle of the fire, and I got back with patience.
The races would require.
Get married ...
I'd play in the middle of the man, "Wow, a push-up guy, seeing that, said more, or, see-floor?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
So, you're going to turn off this infernal fire?
I leave the flower and say, "I know I don't."
I tell you everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little ...
of love?
