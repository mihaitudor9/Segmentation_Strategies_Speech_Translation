I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What this said, that the true character of a society is revealed by the way I portray their children.
But in Brazil, we're living a paradox: our children are what we have of most precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our lives for them and, however, our children grow up very badly treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, which is what I hope to do a little with you today: if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which are the majority, according to Mandela's critics, we are a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, food, and food, we offer it, prison.
Gabriela's mother wants a natural birth, that moment of relationship, of affection with her daughter, to receive, along with her husband, this baby who will be born, and then starts to attend pre-natal school, and rapidly the hospital industry, but it's very convincent, that produces the culture of blinding, it's strong, that can be hungry, and in two months, the industry is forbided to make sines, that we'll be there, hunger, a culture that can have hunger, and, in their head, that we can have hunger, because we're there with a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, and a doctor, there for us,
The suprim, breast milk is money, it's for, it's breastfeeding, but industries make the advertisement directly with the doctor, its marriage, convinced of its nutritional qualities, in congressions, and sponsoring integrally the medical society, being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil, and it, unfortunately, superior to one of these forms, will end up a license, it grows because it grows because the vovion can't take care of it.
Convide is what gives us the intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children and we're losing this, and the child loses convivial with the most important people in their lives.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, there's no money to pay the maid, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging the Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderful, that's a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge amount of salt and sugar, crocantes outside, a little window of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this exists, guys, we don't have to stay in memory, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, can, we, we can't, we, we, we, we, we, have energy, we, and we don't have water, we, we have energy, and we don't have water, we, each car, each other, we, each other, each other, each other,
(Laughter) This is the name, the IPOR, which she watches four hours on television a day, she spend more time on television, the Americans were in recording and in our work, they are berees of what is most important to us, creativity and imagination, and we're breastfeeding this from our children, with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction because we have less time at school.
And then, on the weekends, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the stool, the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family on the weekends, which is me, very well, but she'll be masacrated by advertising, and, obviously, the teenagers who need friendship are the teenagers, and they are deeply affected by the commercial beer, and who will disagree with obesity, obesity, obesity, obesity, and child consumption.
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: "Merodization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, the excessive value of appearance, and even worse, in the disociation of sexuality, love and minds of them, when they are eight or ten years old, but she could meditate in the little square, in the balancing, we are at the balancing, we are at the balancing, we are at the ball, at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky, looking at the sky,
Well, faced with so many problems, of course, childhood will give symptoms, the child will rebel, which is to the disturb of attention and hyperactivity, we interrupt between children's experience and the world, making them not coexist with it, the king of Mafalda makes this rebel from a city, and the doctor sees that they're from the doctor see that they're from the retroalimental back, that they're from a city, that they're doing, in school, they don't have a city, but, for example, they don't have a child, they don't have fear, and they don't need each other heavy, they don't need each other fiscint, they are scared, but they don't need each other
But I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we reflect on this, a very useful TEDx solution, I'm surely spending my time, but it's OK, I'm a little, a solution that passes only by changes in two factors, time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, and penitence today means "dight apartment," in almost all churches, "dizing" is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, of our most important capital, is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's a seven-hour point that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes, this gives an hour and 40 a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's only to priorize, and if it doesn't happen during the week, we start with a good place to live, to visualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes, tell me if you fit in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This brings us a little the importance of nature between us, and nature is deeply associated with nature to the environment, everything that does well for the rivers, does well for the earth, it does well for the time of relief, reduces stress, reduces pollution, with my organic body, does well the body, and vice versa, riding bicycles, does well the body, the pollution, bringing me that isn't giving me my presentation, and said, "Wow, you said something, but you said something incredible, something incredible, something incredible, something incredible for me, and it's good for me, it's a good space for me, and for me, it's a good space for me, for me, for me, and for me, it's open to me,
And when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about public spaces with nature, that promote bike lanes, free events of these places, baking space, baking gardens in the city, public transport, with air, and the green that produces good to be physical, good to be psychic, mental, and not only reivindicating because of this, that makes us easier to contact with public space, with players, with public space, with players, with public space, with players, with players, with love, with the city, with the city, with the city, and the city, with the city, and city, and city,
Unfortunately, all of this is called occupation of a city, and how we're talking about utopia, people, I disagree, showing a phase of the air of the air of the Galian air that left us this year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is in the social horizon, and, mainly, taking part in the kids outside, let's make them learn the difference between catastrophs, with the public, with a game, with a game, with a game, with a game, with a play, with a joy, with joy, with joy, with joy, with a game, with joy, with a game, with a game, with disability, with disability, with disability, participation, and participation.
In 2007, I came across a large group of young and adults with disabilities, excluded from regular education, and since then, my biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Caf√© terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) In order to discuss inclusion within school, with parents, children and partners, people with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do, and in this project, they show this to parents, to the community, and to society in general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think that they are not able to have friendships, to feel like acting with people, so, for four years, he stayed in the court, participating in all kinds of physical education, and since he loved to run, and people didn't have the strength for that too, he was running all the time.
When I got to the clean field, I sought to know Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school, and what together we could do so that he could ...
They improved the best learning.
The school, for Igor, was a place of despair.
(Laughter) Well, it doesn't mean it's a bomb, today he's very happy, he has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says that I'm the best friend of him and, for two years consequently, he gave me the present day of his parents.
I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading, the school can teach autonomy, freedom of expression, and it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning.
The schools think they are not able to attend these students and that these children, inside the school, do good for them, will do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning from others because the choice is like this: "There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together."
AC: Do you want to know what I learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see it.
I learned to use my hearing, I learned to value my legs, living with people who don't hear, with those who can't walk.
But the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise of empathy and to learn to value my ideas with those that, many times, have difficulties in understanding what we're talking about, thank you very much.
Good evening.
Audience: Yes.
I've always liked eating, cooking, working in the kitchen, and she'd take care of Christmas seeds, in the new, Pa√°scoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that, until today, she asked me, "How, and why did I go to the kitchen, and that's the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking?"
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study philosophy, they revealed something that I think that modernization took away from many young people, and respect for nature.
So, I decided that we could change the way we build the food system through food, and I believe...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life, so I believe that if we bring between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way that we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve a political, economic, social, and environmental tool.
It's able to reestructure the food system, distribution and consumption of food.
And I believe that people know the animal's life cycle, it's artificially accelerated, because, as you can, it's produced as cheaper, in terms of legumes and vegetables, the production process, it's starting to grow and produce in a way that their bodies don't hold, and, for example, each Brazilian consumes around five kilos of agrotoxic per year, this didn't fit in my head.
I'd like to understand why, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, but you're investing, many times, you don't know that, behind that allergic, there was someone who took care of all care of all affection, and took this interface to you, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
I think I fell in love with cooking and nutrition, you must know that we produce a lot of food, a third of the food we produce.
But, in fact, it's very important, and if I pick it up, see those executives or those pregnant people walking down the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because it's also something that it gets very scared, and this makes us lose the notion of society, or talking about consumption, it's very harmful for our health, and we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little jewels, biscuits and stuff, also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo-duria√ß√∫car," which are the three, that is, industrialized products in excess is very harmful, and they end up creating a non only physical dependence, but also a mental dependence, a physiological dependency, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
If you're still a cake, instead of buying that little package, OK... Metade half... (Laughter) Who here still makes a pick of bread, a few bread in the place of microwonds, look... half a half... (Laughter)
This question may seem like these two questions, may seem a little harmless, not wanting to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the pump of panel for the pump of microwaves, of a packaging, it's this that could be a trash less in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrial products is very pre-gidicious, it's consuming chemicals that you wouldn't wear panels, and you're also polluting with packaging.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think this food dynamic is a lot, this food system isn't healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
(Applause)
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health, cooking brings safety, bringing independence, bringing high self-awareness, if we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, it simply process food, so if you let the industry feed you?
"Yes ...
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, chicken dog.
What is a pizza?
Know the rice and the bean, I think there are many people who don't care, there's no appreciation in the kitchen, and half an hour you have the ready meal, and, for example, if you leave the bean in the mold of night to day, the morning cord, this would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait peel to get there.
Speral of the book of Pizza ... So, I believe we must change.
So, changing education, we teach children, taking their children to fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner: boy, child, adult, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can cook, and they must cook, so the children will build a better future.
I believe that we have to change the food dynamic, we have to value food more, value the act and cook, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to the permit.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
(Laughter) I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education and prevention, so?
The future of food will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better, thank you.
Life is not the one we lived.
AC: But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Because a large part of my mother's family is here, I came here, as a child, to spend the vacations with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties, my grandfather, Mario G√ºeyce, are the stories that we tell, that make us who we are, and we need to see who came back, and honor, all stories.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories and ads in 15, 30 seconds, about products, this book helped me to live mourning, to have used and told this story, to me, brought one of the most beautiful things about it, that I needed to expand, that I knew the whole world here, from TEDx, that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how I had happened.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx, and I left because he had to do with him, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying, because that's what he's always suffered, without fear.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also to have seen that the change they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story, grew up on stage, and many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
So many, not only in them, but in my too, from everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear, we transform, show their children's picture, but, to talk about heart, you have to come from heart, and to me, if there's no formula, yes, a big rule, in that place, you have to come from the heart.
One day, two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered because I tell the story of the egg, the audio, the professor of the Egypical University of Jerus besides, he researched the listening, and he changed everything, and there was always something that bothered the other, and how it was the fact that he had been heard when he needed it, when he had cancer.
So we talk about change, but we're afraid to change, although the most dite word here is that we'll change, we transform ourselves, there's always this fear and, as this fear, we always arrive and say that it made him study about it, for ourselves and for others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to come to embrace and say.
So, as we can talk about my empathy, we don't have time for people, because we're worried about our lives, if we haven't learned to listen.
And this, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
We have yes, we have, for example, that when we say on the street, many of us, that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most variable to listen outside all others, and we have, at least, a smile, and it doesn't cost anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and we realize that they make us who we are, and when we listen to others in truth, we transform ourselves, and, in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip ... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be doing this.
To show her the key of her lives, of the room of flaws, of the salles of values, of the kitchen of uncertainty, wanted many people I know, at least one minute of rest, to later look back to her side and smile again, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, that I don't belong to many spaces, this is one of the poems I wrote for a while, but, in respect, from a moment when I recognized myself, as a trans woman, they are only part of their plurial places, there isn't this thinner or thinner lag, beautiful, delicious to the poor, but, however, to resist and to exist, it was always a state of life for me.
So, why are we so tiny, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and definitely understand that the different one agrees?
And this wants to laugh with this exchange, before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was, what I would be, the different to the beauty, where I laughed, where I cried, the toilet, the toilet, for me, was a layer, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from you, allow yourself.
(Video) Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend, he was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to put the towel on my head and dance rebeldes, because I've only been up until today.
But the question is, what I had in the bathroom, that wasn't in the other places, and that was denied for me, and, during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see girls transitating friends, and because when you enter a hammer, there was a lot of empathy in this world coming, I started to look for my true essence, I started to mirror myself with the other, and it's as if I were to have this freedom, it's as if you were a time there, and it's as if you were a time there, I'd been a time there, and I'd been a beautiful time there, and I'd been a time there, and I'd be a be an athlete.
They get bothered by their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come here, do you go after yourself, our new thing, there's no crossing faces, no, you're staying, you're going to pass?"
People, who are aware, choose that 35-year-old life expectancy has a lady here who wants to see such a section?
As a white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
And I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this, that I call the veracity of this, and, second, if we compare with the strangers that were killed here in Brazil, we have even 14 times chance to die with the "J" magazine and "perform" and TUB, and in the apex of my career, for example, my art, only proof of this, that I finally found who I was, that I could have my essence, for example, my part, my art, my part, my part of us, as a way of life, a condition for us, that I could have a condition of life, but not a life, for example, I could have a life, not a life condition, but a life of life, not a life.
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
And I did Matacinho, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "They've been filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, and there's no price."
Audience: Yes.
(Audience) Yes.
What has no price is to receive message from mothers from other trans, thank me, for teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best message of other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me for seeing me there and seeing yourselves, "This has no price."
So, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm much beyond that, I'm much beyond trans, but to understand this, I'm an unknown post, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky is the refuge of allies human beings, yours and me, but the future, no longer looks, I don't need to stop, who was me, who was next to me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
And I spent many years doing this and following the children, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, it won't take a sixth grade, well, it was called, but I saw that, at the hospital, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do surgery."
(Laughter) I took the courage, I had never been hospitalized, so I didn't talk to children, don't give Google, because, after all, I wasn't the best place, not when you're with children with cancer, and it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure and committed ghosts, and I asked to call my parents, and she said, "Yes, it's out of the visibility doctor."
So I looked for information in a safe place, at that moment, that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I realized so much information, I was stuck, and I learned what bothered me, forgot, threw, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, the crazy was for them, that I wasn't able to see me as a doll, and, with that, I saw many other information that I thought wasn't the most suitable.
I picked you up, "No, now I'm the same for you, I got cancer, when I entered the hospital, a careca, the children said, "Wow, you cut your hair off to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed, and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a toothpaste, a toothpaste tea, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a tea, and I didn't have hair.
They showed me, they'd send videos, work with chemotherapy, passing through radio, and various procedures, until I couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, we started photographing the patient in the middle of the process, and, until one day, doctors started to call me, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll talk a lot about the procedures, what we did, what we did, what we did, what we normally do, the chemotherapy, that my therapyB, which we do, which is how we do BAB, how we do BAB,
I have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising person, and we know if we put a poor child, hugged, sad, you'll sell a lot more than 40 hospitals in Brazil, sometimes information is a pent, and we can only do, around 2 to 3,000 guides a year, to children, every year, because something doesn't have a chemotherapy, and engage the patient.
(Laughter) OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go to the window, to see the father with my life is good, and when we need self-esteem, you only have information that puts you down, so I think it's very important to give a little bit of attention to your society.
We do information with all this, to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others. Thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because dependency here gives me a disease, and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism: one of these defense is in our brain, it's called "zing ematozophalic"; despite it seeming to be a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of our brain, and that make these viruses and substances that don't enter our brain and don't do bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the pack of serphaly, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by cells, anticorposs, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
So, could we not gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities, realized that those people who used more drugs, producing anticopus, producing anticopus, producing anticopus, as if the immune system told them this.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barri√®re to help these patients?
(Laughter) I and my team.
How does this work, this substance enters our immune system, produces anticorpos, against drugs, and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a large and pum molecule, it's no longer on the huge barrier and if it's false.
Look at this image here, how is this process beautiful, OK?
Here, on your right, we have a while that hasn't received a vaccine, once we were able to imunize them, and you can see, on the left side of you, it's a molecule of cocaine marked with radiation, it goes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals, these white dots that you see, there's a significant amount of white dots you see.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, you're arrested in the blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these people with chemical dependence, then what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people gain freedom, we believe that this treatment has more inhibited than what doesn't happen with the rats receive cocaine.
Invisible can travel the wind.
I'm being.
A psychotherapist.
More than 40 years ago.
And I want to read and say that beyond.
Danerose, but beyond psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who has already infelelelelled, lost, and me.
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I have to say that maybe, these are one of the charming.
Great meeting of this TEDx out of this pure one.
It's that girlfriend is being punished from the beginning.
What do we love?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors filled with social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way, in some way.
The legal war, for example, is an example, maybe the most mortal than the norm.
Up to where I can comprehend, there are two fundamentals of the most important of the norm, and it's the systemic, systemic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
Not always it will exist, girlfriend is a typical disease of moments.
Where do we live in a context?
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
Why?
Dishumanity, lack of listening, lack of care, lack of responsibility, where it predominates corruption, in its words, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
A worker for more than 30,000 years.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the queue, Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy: how many wars, Perei, who comes, for a bit of chestnings.
What military for peace?
But with other weapons, weapons of responsibility awareness.
of compassive love.
So, in the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes, healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucious, an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
From a family Isabelo's family paragl, she was five, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What's the princess you like most, the baking sheet, the sleeping sheet?"
She thought and answered, "I like all bad writing.
I also respect many people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling in your own skin.
All the people who looked for me were accessible people with panic illness, for example, the pain, the contradictions, that the Nordmotics didn't accept, to not say sensitive, who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is the fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel deprived of forests.
And being deertified, these people would dismay.
And I respect a lot.
People known as psychiatrists and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
People considered crazy in Africa are also considered safe.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
Sistenic, and sometimes it doesn't fail, and as I said?
Change the difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that the saints know and won't go, maybe these people, at least in a great extent that we call "sikatic," are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an ins√¥nia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here, a psychotherapist, and said to me, "Doctor, I have a problem at home.
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
He went back to lunch.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how is this fabulous team that organized this meeting?
That nothing against certainty at that moment,
That you suffer a desire too.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo, racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
Namorphosis!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The outspecialization girlfriend, who knows almost everything, (Laughter) and each one is looking at the minimum, mimored and doesn't realize, their existence in the sense time, we are in an inexorable globalization, a person who is extremely specialist, is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
To make the appology of the generalist, but it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe there's a concept in this education that has also been pointing here.
That I have called vocation as a possibility of a deeper solution.
The desire that brought us incarnation.
It's what brings us on a common stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
And we live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
And we saw to tell a story.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution of human beings, but the human being, as Tia Chartan said, is the space where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to now, to be seen.
Someone asked for the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
To talk about the mystery, in the big wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings that potentially ...
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we hear doesn't happen to you.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once a forest.
Not to give up.
What is this?
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flow!
who would take a source, a water drop, and return, resiliently, another gota, lawyer in the middle of fire, and return with patience.
Do you think that with these ridicles, or beija-flor, small-haired people, would play in the middle, "A Tartufo, Jo√£o, see that," said, "But are you going to turn off this infernal fire?"
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
Now, I'm doing my friend Tatu, my part.
The same with good intentions, but always, in an arrogant way, we're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society, because a hundred before they've become.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square, and the first responsibility is to introduce a little of peace, a little of order, a little of love.
In this small part of the world, where does the big world trust each one of us, and if we don't do that, where can we be facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
which is to breathe consently, with the world and with the mystery, I can with others, I recommend a book to the conspiracy Corean of Marilyn Fex, who studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a ground sloth.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it, we can do it, we can do our part, in fact.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came, each of us talking about their water had water.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, there's your life story, telling your story.
And taking her little water drop, because we can always turn a candle, once just complain about the darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time for renewation.
I love it.
"You are."
I believed.
We stretch.
That's it.
Comassive love and poetry will still save the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Ver√©ndez.
