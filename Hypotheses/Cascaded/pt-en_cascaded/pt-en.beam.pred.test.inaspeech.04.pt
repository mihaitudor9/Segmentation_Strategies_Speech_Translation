Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference?
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary.
that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009.
When I was still in search of a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
Do you have a college entrance exam?
For wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times they would buy clothes, "Um."
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewel to do some adds?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
Now that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
That was it.
to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I did it.
A square with a very high cause, elastic of the blindness to make more comfort.
I made a hyper-descret to make her exchange for the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance of this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no support to form snakes that are wound caused by the actress of the skin with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I did it for Carlena.
A light is that it was open in the shoulders.
A warm of button of pressure.
To make it easier when you pass your head.
In fact.
There are people who are quadriplegic, the ideal.
It's thinking of a dress that facilitates who's going to dress the person.
And for paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, a visually impaired person.
I made a dress that she could use in many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in armile, so people could have access to some basic information.
Like the size and color of the play.
Kelle's kelle's roots are narrow.
And for women, with anism or low stature?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
My excitement in this work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there is.
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news?
It's that businesses are already thinking.
Are they producing more modern products?
As colorful wheelchairs.
Stramped Prots.
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world that is already in the décima edition?
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
which are the big companies.
Special and conceptual marks that realized the real need of this dressed room.
And they are already launching inclusive collections, like the Americans take.
And it's already in your second inclusive collection due to the size of success that was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Listening of four years old.
Until adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community, we started working with the record.
I was conscientizing people, "How?
Putting garbage, knowing how to separate one trash from the other, so I tried to talk to the child, and it was making awareness of their parents.
The parents who were taking care of giving me the child, people recognized me in the community.
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I work with the children I know.
In my community?
Do we have a seed collection when we go to the forest?
You'll work with SAF.
We have a plant.
When I met a plant called Hengar's name, it's a lecominous plant, that we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
And all the plants I eat.
How many below it have a good result in our community?
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
That all plants!
It was used every one of its place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
So, you have to imitate forest, why?
There in the arm.
Was there a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more than so many.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So, I tried to plant them, variating, there I have the assau, the cup, graviola, Andiróba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná.
And it's all there, there's no plague.
We come there.
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside?
Five partners of ours: in our community, we work there with organic molecules.
You eat everything natural, you don't have toxicity in our community, OK?
(Laughter)
Comparate human beings?
Like an animal.
The child compared her and, when only to pay, you talk, she's there listening and passing me to other children.
So, I compare the child like this ... (Laughter) Hai's top was coming to this attention, then he spoke the animal quote ... (Laughter) "Do you compare with your human being?"
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection, the most caught by those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting all on the axis, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
I'm a person.
What observes my house?
I kept observing my house and ... (Audience) I kept observing.
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things leave us there, everything is fine.
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, had a future.
And it's work out, and today we have it?
With a job inside, with which is far from the atom.
"When I'm going to take?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children: for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tartaruga of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river, what was it before?
They had a hooligan.
In front of you?
That's how it's a little bit like our community.
And ...
This hooligan didn't dress and...
It ended with the river.
And today we have a people who saw it.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature, understanding nature.
And I always liked the forest.
So, I went by with people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... it's a guy.
They breathe the pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest.
It's always being talking to people teaching children.
"And ...?"
Moving on to other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small.
That I'm like that.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and come to be next to us.
Let's talk about it, how do we bring people into practice?
And I'm very happy.
I'm like this, if I don't send my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely thank you, guys.
I'm gay.
In contrast with the name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
I wish these children, they're very proud.
From my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this reality dream.
I wanted to create this family.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
And it's just ...
It puts life at risk.
Imagine all the more and parents who are here, as we feel.
Like a fear that has lost our child.
And we had two options, we could.
to collapse, to cry, or...
It's to solve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a beautiful mood to find.
For them, being able to make a subway transplant, which is what they need to be cured.
What about it?
It was incredible because all the school's most friends did a very big movement, sharing the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, calling "mul," very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
That when a child has leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest problems of fears, concerns.
It doesn't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and this is what we learned from this lesson and spread to our friends, to the school's more, to society, Facebook people, talking about it, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
(Laughter) The second message he had with this disease, publicly, and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all these families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a divorced mother, a warrior.
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease, to the world, "What?"
Neither the blood nor the strawberry.
We can make them.
Our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human who can give someone else, so he raised that awareness.
We have this ability.
Dedoing blood for what needs.
For someone who has blood, their blood is necessary in their parts.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everyone is processing and they need.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a donor and a patient, it's one ...
About 100,000 people, so if you ...
Or to save in life, it's as if you were winning the mega-have.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when he moves three.
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be able to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life, if me, more strength, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that ...
Or so credible?
What happens to all of us?
By supporting us, by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
It's called LECO.
You looked at it.
Basically, it's like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
I'm serious.
She was born in Damasco.
Capited from Syria.
I, an engineer.
I studied at Damasco University.
Today ...
I'm a refugee.
Not Brazil with my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little crazy.
In front of the Portuguese.
That's why.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today.
I'll talk about this.
What bothers me the most.
"Broken-to."
Who exists about Slam?
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with this one.
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was 20x.
Three million people.
I had ...
My family.
My friends I knew as a child.
Three, two, already cut down.
I'm an Engineering writer.
Two apartments.
I, a car.
Intamasco.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Foli.
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until it's one day.
The war began.
March 15.
It was in 2011.
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all other cities.
From the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had delivered: Vinci.
It's 25.
There you go.
Origia.
How good!
In five years of war.
This is my country.
It's a hero.
People: those I know were forced to carry on or drop.
Of your children.
They found their voices.
Vert and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiares disappeared.
And they didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
I didn't know if it's going back home.
When I left to work, my family would come back again.
Or not.
Today.
Millions of Syrian lost everything.
They were dead or refugeed in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, our mind and our life remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still live there.
And I don't know if I'll come back to them again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
After, ten months.
Obviously, Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
"So?"
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad.
And they said that São Paulo ...
It was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
And TEDxApinas.
Or a week, shine back.
Fifty years of my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Your mother!
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party for me to live, my children's birthday, and they all said very well.
The reason why my speeches talked to me to take advantage of what the kitchen is.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
Hi, that I created "Dagine on Facebook" or "Talade with Ideciria," that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) It's there that the video signs.
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world is.
It was closed.
For us.
Unbelievable because of war and terrorist attacks.
Many people had a wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, in the morning here.
Or a journalist says to me,
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
Or contact?
As a homosexual.
A Muslim.
A lot!
That Islam loves blood.
It is allowed to tackle the name of religion.
But exactly ...
The diving.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also blankets.
The Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image.
A basic religion.
Alcurão.
I'm not a book.
It's sacred since a person kills.
Without she had killed another, or semiated, corruption, land, and as if she killed all men and who read about life, it would be as if she lost her life to the king of her mother, kesbolo, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil -
It showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When people see a woman using "hijabi"?
That handkerchief that covered my hair, just like my wife, was my wife.
Do you ask questions like?
Why do you use this handkerchief?
With that heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
(English) "Aline de Reijabi."
Today, read other rules.
Men and women can't be touched.
To start.
Yeah!
Excess are of wedding voices.
Some people told me.
But I've already seen humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Look, Tao Slam has these rules, more than each person wants to buy or not.
"Poblata well," "browib," some things to be.
The same way we have to be that they don't obey everything.
It's not good for having killed as fat cane and alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Let's do it.
With more than a partner.
This didn't happen to me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because these things are forgotten of isolation.
Our religion is very important for music.
But, in spite of not knowing the coin, then.
That the agency explains people always.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Teacher, Mohamad Dés."
And we must respect all religions.
That everyone has the same value.
Because we must have.
Right?
With all of us.
It doesn't matter if you scream white, black, or Indians.
Oislam also says.
that we should help the people who need it.
Every year we take Alsaka and we give.
Two points, five, for a moment.
All of our money for people.
But poor.
It doesn't matter if the poor are Christian or Jewish Muslims.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
What it was like to understand is a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
To finish.
with "Oubrecent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children.
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is the moleque?
In the little histories of life.
I come to recite my tears.
In the emerging sun in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up to the saints of whom?
Espera sempre, achievement.
Those who believe it's always a reach.
I don't believe, I soon lose hope.
But, in the daily cave, I know who suffers.
Lavulça do food, my salary ends, just like this race.
A girl, a girl, was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Fascinira.
What didn't hire me in the mall?
I don't understand, this makes me so much to pay a Secretary course, but not even within the office.
Excuse me, as there was an event among you.
I clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
So, ME is CT, be a maid, if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, I gave myself an opportunity.
And the teacher told me.
You follow this corridor.
It goes straight, turns on the left, enter that little side that the vassor is waiting, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about Facebook: the page arose in July 2016 and this year, this year, it hasn't even completed four months.
And since I wanted this page, it wasn't programmed, I was on vacation house.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
I was told in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach's topic, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook, like "diás"?
I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, a girl, all you can do on Facebook, "Yeah, tomorrow is my new day!"
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
I warned people, "Look, guys.
I remembered some stories I'll start.
Post this on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid, so that, in case, other people have gone through this too, compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always speaking in the past.
To my surprise.
In less than 24 hours this went viral very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first narrative on the Internet was referred to my last job as a maid in the city of Santos, this in 2009.
Yes, I was hired to be a cook?
And my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food.
I had to bring the container, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared it.
This first story on the Internet went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
It must be from London, the German TV Dábio and several times.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reporters, watched Skype, than everyone.
Everyone!
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil.
And then, they were able to rebuild and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
domestications are more valued, they earn.
For hour, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive many abusive advertisements in my page.
which gives employment announces that I've tried as abuses, for example, an advertisement I read.
It was for workers and working secondly.
Access.
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, per month.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started doing paper, that became a daily practice, so what I did was home, rubbed all the speed, books until today, they cost a lot of money, and my domestic mother, passing through these conditions, even today, there are domestic, suffering all these acrotions of buying the books I wanted, and I entered a single house, and I found something that I call the humanized treatment to clean, which I always did.
(Laughter) And there it's sitting down, delicizing me with those books, and, to my surprise, Regina gets into the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing the experiences I'd been through in the past, I got to read at university, I said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was a kid, I read a lot of books, I want to understand the history of the world," and then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing, and it was very difficult."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, Mello, Black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first synchron of paths, all this when I eat and sponsor some reports, is very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone.
Why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 addicts 6 percent according to 10 of 2013, are black women.
And that?
It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a work like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I couldn't understand, but she knew everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, too.
I would also pass because I took too long to understand that curriculum with pictures and good appearance is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they were suspicious, after graduation, they took suits of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on, and so on?
"Yes."
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what the big house in the past are the luxury apartments today.
The domestic slaves in the past, and it's the past not to have a distant past, it's very low to us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern senior.
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to get there on Friday, and when I got there, I was already wearing the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was the maid's money.
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to marriage.
Because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the neck of the employee, and the only solution I had was to take copies from all rooms.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his cassette, because when I say I'll change employment, my friends say, "Menine, stay, you gain 1,800 reais per month, you'll never get that value in another place."
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service.
I brought my little kick, my knife, and I was there, in the area of service, tight, I took my sailbow pot, and made it in number one, and my pattern saw it, I was very scared, and said, "Why are you using the sovere's pot if I use the bathroom?"
It's the maid's money, "Today I'm here."
Statistics, for some people, in my place, would be there in faxine, because when I told my boss I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but the mother wasn't a houseke too, she's already predestined to your family to come."
So, you have to be happy, to be come, so I'm here, counterparticans, statistics: black, fat woman ... (Applause)
(Applause) Woman arrested, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
(Applause) Antrans of me have 6 million houses.
That should be here next to me.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But it's only about seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestications work and study, and here, again, this domestic work has a private property, we can see at the airports, why babies have to be dressed as white, but I'm not doing for six million households?
They are shapes that are being forced.
I'm here today to talk to you.
About silencing.
It's already a bit funny to come out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
I first take the time of my talk to disconnect.
They connect their cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying of fear.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
Please tell you that silence is a door for who we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing the 8th grade, the conceptual day of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did the acid start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go."
And I had it.
Almost 30 years of game meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
It goes to the car.
Open your agenda, bravo.
Take your eye.
It's insecurity and equipment.
I propose inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book.
And I was sure that I wouldn't realize it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote.
He spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to the state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have beliefs, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
Then, in cure.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
I didn't know that I lived a big one of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
To determine my choices.
Right now, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just kept his cell phone.
Several of you.
I thought.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
You listen to me.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this step.
It's not close to you, it's off.
Turn off, cell phones?
(Exhaling) Put them on the floor ... (Exhales) Put your cell phones on the floor.
(Laughter) Put your bags, the floor.
Chorus: Here.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
with everything closed.
You are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
It is a sphere of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
in São Paulo.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"Let's look at her in the face!"
You're good, you've got a little gun.
AC: He was connected, guys.
Look!
Do you see where you are?
They saw it.
Do you see?
"Yes."
You see ... (Exhaling) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born.
And fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Even because this guy, right now, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember that ...
Two dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
In the human brain, we are connecting space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
Certainly of you, it's happening.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take part in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
Which brings the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
No, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality: it's new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
The silencing?
And a state of presence that comes from him.
It can become.
A habit in our lives?
They are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
In the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be the direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate.
Autensity.
For another authenticity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
EDXT.
This is what reaches the first video, right?
I had a demand for a region of Idete fans.
What did they ask behind societies?
My friends, your colleagues, your family.
Once more than just one.
At least, it has an influence in English.
How about it when?
The translator is the key.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays?
Ten percent of them are Brazilians.
Seven and 16 young people.
And with almost all the time in 6,000 translations made.
These are made in events, like these here.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment?
First, it's transcribed.
Two from the Netherlands, in general.
To later be lost by my time and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
They have technology like Pedro TET: "Entrortinely," which is "e," that we can translate as a fun.
And do you get out?
I referred to São Paulo.
They are from sedentary or competitive, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship.
Species that come back at times of chance.
The theme is this auditory event.
It's that free time we have.
Contracts also reduction.
I said, "This video is about 20 Brazilian reals."
It's to translate and think about realizing how we want.
Think about the TEDx environment.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what a translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only delicious, sometimes I say another song.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I know at this event.
But why do I think I have it, is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive accident.
GB: In initiatives, like this one.
And to become that one.
That is potentially that I don't have everything and that is education.
"There's also a stunning, what do you want?"
I can integrate everything.
And when is it a fish and volunteer work?
Because I've always my choice, my decision.
And try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different from donating.
And it transforms forms that call us this time.
It took me from a very violent translation.
There's always.
A partner really knows the beginning.
It changes research.
Many jobs, many hours of dedication.
For us, from such a fluent translation, to be ours, okay?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be 1,000 million.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
Sounds and transexuals.
Or as we call, "Because it's not from you."
I want to suggest Portuguese, Portugal, because I'm different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to cite here.
Very well.
I have to hear it.
What do I live there?
A deep, political crisis, right?
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Nevertheless, I knew this baby very well and did the four mathematics operations, and their dream was always able this.
And to make the children, for this reason, want our neighbor to live in our neighbor from Minas called Tairobeiras.
And, somewhere, my father had sold his start, his middle logic, and his place.
If he also knew, as a businessman, he found that Mattel in a presence store had been investing years.
In 1964.
He stayed, literally, without any years when you killed your old furniture.
One felt very humble with his economic clown, and my father decided.
My mother, who has been here for years now, is helping me, right?
It was an excerpt of cooking.
Sport of training.
And she decided to make "consects" to sell.
Travels went literally.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in a way.
It's that we are subjects to study.
And how about that?
A big question, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by friendship and homicilious.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
(Laughter) A lawyer who thought of every episode of the area, chose a buy and, for anybody, visited him to come home.
Today, I think that this should be the greatest "Pantalisas de Parkia," right?
But for my father, they would check their babies there.
And, without knowing, he was training me.
So the conditions were better than we had, right?
And here I say, to me, the greatest passion in my public practice is my two kilos: Daniel, Henrique.
The adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident to me or not?
Four of us, my brothers, have become teachers, education is to be a doubt at some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the educator without a mark too fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies.
So ...
The only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion with active people is TEDx?
It has to do with cry.
I do more than TEDx, just as my father works in simple management in the instants.
Don't be inspired.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with her armile.
A alphabet where you can feel the things you're written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explain how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it was super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a ticket.
It's a tiny that allows you to describe in braille.
On the street, you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, I gave tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started to research, thinking that there would be thousands of processes of this, they would go online, and it would be ready to connect with the engines, and we would have a clock.
But she saw there was no Internet before deciding what our own is.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaked and nothing happened, but we did it write everything, disconnected and reconnected everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock.
And we showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to try to make a small report or a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It can help out in inclusion and potentially many other people.
And this showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my bestia that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So, we wanted to show a video that our aunt, beyond the time on the clock, feeling the pines, and leave the message that many things seem very simple: they weren't created yet, and if even we, two high school students, who didn't finish, in high school, we are second, and we are teenagers, we are able to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help you.
Let's ask you a question.
What does it hide?
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people.
(Sigh) You can put your hand in the air.
Audience: Yes.
OK, we're all cutting, two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
In other words, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance commercially.
It's that it's a half exchange, that is, there's a part that has sex relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part with the goal.
To get pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business autonomously, publish their ads, receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or have street thinkers.
And that no one has the pluralities.
This is what I'm talking about.
And I'm not here to talk about cases who are involved.
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults that shouldn't be than their consent is crime cases, are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the adult prostitution that is forced, which is coherent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, forever, stilherent by voluntary and forgotten frustration.
And it also doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse this situation against sexual exploitation.
In other words, but to take all the people who do prostitution through traffic victims for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
Because research has shown that Portugal fell.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive. They are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, it indicates that in Portugal 108 traffic victims were confirmed.
Human.
Almost all of them for job exploitation, victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
Because there's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
And many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
Very ugly.
Sured.
This is something that expects someone to wrap well.
But does this also not answer to reality, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people migrate.
There are economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, that is, we know that there is a diversity of buildings that influences the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, conversations, I'm with people who do sex work, what they tell me is that this was an option.
It's a hidden option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity which is profitable, but highly witnesses a dese, and it's not recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think what is the image you see immediately in your mind when you think of a person that prostituates.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or any other one.
Or, a woman with a bad appearance and minissaia who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, who's probably a lot of beathoxic with a relative and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor to reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
(AG) Brats.
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
But it's not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many women who transgend sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Does anyone on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are the distance of being made.
And the accidental cities.
Try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, telling us that...
Please, Sindroa.
Because it will only represent people around 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when we think, "A woman?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
In other words, they are less.
They're minorities, but they're not neglected.
I'm going to give you the studies of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a bigger sex worker, a study led by the third sonhadia of the University of Esbola, and who interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the context of internal, men, women, trans people, and who, all over the country, found 102 percent of men.
And now, 7.8 percent of trans women and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even more high.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very ridiculated here in Portugal recently.
Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
Prohibited, selling sex, but it's a crime.
The idea is that it's at the bottom of this law.
It's that people in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, if they are victims of an oppressor and the person, the client, and, therefore, we'll criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other pensions after Sweden and Sweden government has talked a lot about the great success of being this law and how it diminished prostitution.
(Laughter) But there have been very strong evidence, namely, non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who already have more sex, and indicate that this law puts higher risk the sweet flavors of sex and that increases their vulnerability to violence.
Therefore, stigma and disease.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that without much research in Piga, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between us.
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships and that, most of all, we are abused relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of cooking our customers is unfortunate.
Because they're the people who have disabilities.
Or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that promote sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
He has the right to his sexuality, and now that I destroyed any argument that tries to be in favor of customer criminalization, and I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, the criminalization of clients.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think for them, it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make them easy for their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
It's what was found on the work connections.
If this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
to condemn them so strongly because stigma is so intense and strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
It's something of morality.
And specifically, moral.
Sexual, that divides sexuality into two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal.
It's natural.
On the other hand, we have a deaf "sex" and consider them legitimate.
Anormal, anti-natural and that's where gender commerce is.
And the fact that the beginning of being considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, social rejection, decridibilization, sanitation, and devalorization of people who do this activity, stigma is a mark with a deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects sex workers is strong, has many consequences: stigma, humanizes, stigma, is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex players, like, for example.
(Laughter) When they drive in institutions in the health area, justice and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if someone has used this word, there's no 'dexibas', a puta stigma.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
And the worst offense we can drive a woman is to call her puta.
In other words, the stigma of the bridge directed to women in two types: the honor and the disabled people, the serious and non- seriously, the ones who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of deplex mirror that's above any of us, any woman knows that, if she gets disappointed, the norms that are socially prescribed, there's a risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk to be called a puta.
"So, what?"
Why do I think we can do any of us so that they don't continue to disrespect sex players?
And I think the path is the path of human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideological assumptions.
And I too.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
In other words, to challenge stigma.
As I'm here to do right now and give voice, to listen to sex workers, to give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time, sex workers are everywhere organized to use 70 but, precisely because of stigma, their voice has no credibility, they are not ears, they haven't been told, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
Audience: Yes.
After all this.
And to finish?
I think it would make sense.
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
I have bad news for you.
Medicine is a lot.
But also have the good news: we can cure, art, cure to be a doctor, it is supported by a fundamental stone.
In the patient's medical relationship.
This relationship, a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can propose the best treatment for that individual.
So, with all the superficial and more reasons, this balance is very delicate, and the human relationships that our time is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips that I followed a lot on average, they were also there several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white eggite, I thought I would take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian disagreees me.
There I found this treatment in a feeling that I wouldn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed what I knew to do and to be able to offer to that person all the doctors who are focusing on it.
So, the path I have and because I want to discover is that at the beginning of medicine, if you give the list of objectives from the student, in air clothes, that we bring, that São Paulo brings to another air practice, that we bring, that São Paulo, the first ones, can be the simplification that runs there, it can be a study that shows.
Altruism?
It's your good."
Of those same students at the end of the courtyard of medicine.
With the same research?
The topics of the statement: success, recognition.
A madness.
When we did it wrong, we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic spirit.
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry about the Belgian relationship with the patient, with medicine, is going back to the past.
In Greece, which is the chest in medicine, where the father is in medicine, who is populated, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before, when Dan, in Gasbo with the apple, Eva drew the leaves, and that was to go on a dangerous trip, it's what we do until today, hasn't touched the same thing.
Maybe if it's an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated, and, of involving these people, there was a logic.
In that occasion too, it was discarded, it was created a pedocrime duration that is used even today in medicine forms around the world.
It was made a sector that, before Christ, I'm from one which.
These are slightly complex words that you said three words.
In all the houses I entered, I just said to see the exercise of the patients, exercising all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and duties.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
If I respect this jury and not violate it, it would be the equality of reputation between men in all times.
If I bring the violin giraff, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, worry about this, and still today you do a training?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to be thrilled, because the patient's medical relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken for honor judgment.
And, in this case, I was honored to participate in a position that is registered for honor judgement.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual for products and science in a way that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that projected so much that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of having a class, and each of us is taking care of a little bit of this, we're going to specialize in healing this one and losing the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says to the exam and can say to the patient, "You can't."
Once I was in college, in small groups classes, as a teacher.
And ...
I worked with sports processes, patients with chronography, resonance and microscopy and ultrasonus.
I'll look for their belly's hands, I didn't make them at home.
"Oh, I also act with posture."
She called me so, called my whole class and said, "Let's see the barrier she's having."
He looked at the screen covering like the patient's finger, notice he was smoking in front of him, and he didn't smoke anymore, hole of five of them, and showed that he had emagreced.
And our "smapper" is funny, you can live together, you're able to take care of your own clothes, a dirty saying, "The time you're mapping for a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that has, it can remind us of something that doesn't teach us, and says, "If all this hasn't convinced us?"
Besides, as you're seeing the patient.
You're here showing you the vulnerable area, it's testing you to move on it.
And, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, and you're staying onto him, you want to do good, and he who you're asking for sneakers so much to him, let's take care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap and are appeared, they improve faster, they have a more precacious clothes, and increases the number of functional diseases, our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There's no surgery, there's no American changes, no X-rays, it's nothing, it's diseases that are symptoms.
This happens, does it happen because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised and said the same.
It's very interesting to talk about the most conscious relationship.
But to be a patient, a patient, and to be passive, to those who are saying this to me.
Because we'll tell this to a group of doctors, because, after all, the active act of the relationship are not the doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking there are two there.
My doctors against everything.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we're patient, passive, and we have to get our hands, in our cure process.
To do this?
The first point, the most important, is information.
Where did the owner talk about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, when I was a child, had many size copies in my house, medicine and health, had a book free of health, and that didn't exist without giving up?
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor, you had to have content to talk, today, with Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them very good and very important, but many tips, very bad.
We need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information, it's greater than the capacity to filter, so there are some things we need to think when we see information first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but knowing who I am.
This gives me a huge call, because people enter there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they'll see for nothing, this tells me bad, because it puts me equally to other people who are defending personal interests, money or vengeance.
The graduation.
Second very important thing: don't believe in good things, seniors: "Look, medicine has changed, now their problems usually ended.
Differently a laboratory, with the scientist, will have a recovering and immediate discovery, without the scientific society to be maturing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow it's on the Internet and my other, when I don't know, silly.
Even if there's a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
You based on who dominates information.
It's hardly some other exclusive interest back then, these things stopped me, we don't believe it.
It's curious.
Any information, discuss to your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information in knowledge, information and information is knowledge.
Take the information, participate in your cure, but apologize your fear.
Secondly important thing to be an active-nacred in Nación Proceta de Cura.
Ask, demand, know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in this surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years, I'm not."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing, it's not to get there, fighting with all our body teachers, it's not that, it's crazy to know.
There is, if we compost with time, we go.
And to make atendments different.
The method you want is this?
They want a good worth.
They don't want to have this attempt, like, "No time," they want to take care of the car.
Audience: Yes.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, the area was mom.
Here we have a patient there, who had a traffic of thinking.
It's humorous.
In the finger.
And there was no speechologist for us, we brought it to São Paulo to be treated with that of cancer, São Paulo.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation, it was an Indian who obviously didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor didn't speak German.
He had a translator, his son, his neighbor, who spoke very little about Portuguese, how he was very bad.
He was obviously confused.
And I introduce myself a consultation.
The doctor's index or the doctor's office, you're like this.
I'm not that it was so much.
Very well.
What I'm trying to say for this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without setting the language, without having a completely different culture from the other, he handed his soul, that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of him.
This magic that wants the art of the middle to heal.
So you don't need to cut a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talked, I have one.
Relatoires and consultants.
So, we, doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
It's a concern.
All patients.
The active pleasure in your cure process.
What's going to do with a connection?
You look at the world, but there's better, and you'll be more invented because of this.
(Applause) Good morning, guys, I wanted to talk to the world, 35,000 Brazilian reais.
What does this news mean?
This number is the quantity of decisions of the human being's decisions per day; the murderers of the magazine had three emotions in this nature: a digital structure, with 50 friends, and the person, two, is given more or less a decision for two seconds, for whom the talk's view is interpreted.
The result of this medicine is that the majority of people chose how you are 25 dollars.
What I really like these experiments is that, usually, they have two groups, for a second group, only two options were examined, a digital option, 52, too.
In the middle of 15,000 Brazilian reais, he launched the print.
What did this choice change, most people chose in the other?
And that left me very unpleasant.
With that I wanted to overcome, and I'd make that decision, and I started studying about it.
I talked a lot about this, I studied a lot about it, I studied in two options to the idea, to influence the person in the making of a decision, or if I was in the middle of her, it makes a ber option to be better, so that I paid between them and students, if I can have two for myself.
This is impressive, because I started questioning myself through social networks of all this, and a TED talk that even made me understand everything, was in a talk that he made a comparison.
Then these behaviors were optical illusions, because I have around me, I think everybody seems a little bigger than the blue symbol in the right year, but we see it differently, because I'm turning the influencers.
There's another better illusion than what does when I come, which is the one that the pieces of a chess will need upside are equal to the pieces of chess and down.
That's when I'd say, "No, I have a problem in the proof that I have all of this."
Without staying at the pieces, we only see that they're really good.
In the same way, what's around us influence the way we see things, what's around us also storms the majority of all the decisions: work and technology.
We were preparing this concept with the concept of icônios magazine, after choosing the two options, the stars, or these two, it was at that moment, gathering this concept of insecurity that we were working, and they said, "Goals and another possibility of choice, this way, she could have the other job, if the person was the whole grace, she would create an application to vet safety."
who make the drawing of architecture of decisions where I'm giving my decisions.
This caught me a lot of versions in the world of technology, and it has even the name for this profession, called YOEX, which are the architects of the decisions, work to pass the architecture of the decision, designing all forms and environments where we make decisions.
AC: As incredible as it may seem, a friend of mine, who knew about this building one day, I broke DRL, who is a burden in this subject of behavioral economy to the digital world, and he was overwhelmed, who was going to start with you and produced Rio Grande, and changed my reform to see the behavioral economy.
Chorus: Here.
If the final idea of the people who have a smartphone, they have this smartphone for 22 hours, nearby.
So, from those 35,000 decisions that we hear is that you can deliver my name, and this purely close, how many horizons have the function of these digital dreams?
In these events, it seems that we're a compass and the digital camera, or that the digital medicine often isn't one of the ones who started to ask me about it.
Is the whole panic, this horizon, how it belongs to a person, comes with her this aviation as it is me?
Are we going to spread the story of the path we're going to take, is it the army that the name of this is William, and we add Wes, "How many decisions we tradition and shout power?"
For the digital world, like Abu Ornães, it's Woogle.
(Laughter) (End of Arabic) (Laughter) It's a number that in Austria, it's 91% and, in reality, Mapa is 4% ... (Laughter) You're from infidelity, (Laughter) In this case, it's a number of tattooers and so on.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Austria have 99% of young people's pain, what in Austria is you already a donor of organs?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magic word called "defol."
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call "disions of capital of birth," "You need to ask to leave."
(Laughter) Someone is already far from drawing to you, you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my phone these days.
And then there are two options: one promised the recipes and another offered awareness; the recipes were dismantled to offers and were killing.
Someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to receive it, so I went there and went out.
(Laughter) I asked to get out of the desert and marked in the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was already there marked to get Google, I don't know if you get "Obrew," they love to talk.
Then, I set it up to open a time and tell a story.
And a lady chose Q.
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
She looked at this strange and said, "Well, there's another sidewalk in the car?"
He looked at him and said, "This guy chose the cube."
And she said, "I bought my foot, right?"
So Barcelona chose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, it's very interesting that we can imagine whoever makes these decisions, if we go to Google today, it has 57 thousand results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from someone was me, was Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the web page.
(Laughter) I love the page seven, and I see from there what the page says, "I'm on the website."
(Laughter) You're going to ask that.
These bodies, in English, have a name in the behavioral economy, also have a name, they are called "innants."
It's not just a little push in English. I want to ask you to give a little push to the person next to you, yes, don't realize how much it is. (Laughter) If it's a microphone, it's a book called Dante.
And the concept of "digitive" is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these emphas in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought, "Geee, right?
(Laughter) And, in this talk, I wanted to take a picture of me, cutting the ice ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) You're thinking that only whoever falls on this is European, Austria and Detina Marca.
Everyone here has received a TEDx confirmation email.
In the midst of a text written, "I want to apply to a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions you'll make in your life..." (Laughter) "He's explaining me.
If you don't want a CD, it's enough to apply this link and ask you to leave: How many people who dealt well, more than 400 inscribed people?
According to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I show the results.
Generally, what do people ask me?
Why have this knowledge of these discomforts?
Necessity.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you have it, you can use it to do because someone buys something they don't need, so you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use it.
To make a diabetes patient know the moment and gets more insulated.
Or can you use it?
For him to be a truck accident, like this ballet, at the same time, whatever the mediation does.
Of the cerebral waves is detected to avoid an accident.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016, which did it with what?
People around the world describes 144 billion phases.
What do you imagine was that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
Mongô is a game that brings the concept of augmented reality.
We're increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better.
How do these little cards work, how do these nights work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfosses.
We were able to be more aware that we made better decisions.
Thank you very much.
