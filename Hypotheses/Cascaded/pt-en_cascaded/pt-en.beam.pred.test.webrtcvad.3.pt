(Applause)
Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
Is there any difference?
Or should I have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist?
Is it to create a college degree?
that embraces everyone.
with people?
And without a disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue bother me so much?
It all started in 2009.
When I was still in search of a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
Do you have a college entrance exam?
For wheelchairs.
So I talked ...
With various women, including parapletas that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times, they would buy clothes: one ...
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewel to do some adds?
And that made me lose the fall of the play.
Now that they'd waste a lot of time and... Audience: Yes!
I lost some money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations ...
Conclusion that I arrived.
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist?
That was it.
to make clothes.
For everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
What's one, a misfortune with other women without disabilities?
And I did it.
A square with a very high cause, elastic in the belt to make more comfort.
I made a discreet to give her the exchange of the probe which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put old.
to facilitate the dress of this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the actress of the skin with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities.
to undobly others with no disability.
And did I do it for Carlena?
A light is that it was open in the shoulders.
With a closure of pressure button.
To make it easier when you pass your head.
By the way?
For people who are quadriplegic, the ideal.
It's thinking of a dress that facilitates who's going to dress the person.
And paraplegic, which gives autonomy to the person to dress on their own.
In this last defile I made, I invited men and women.
With and without disability?
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
In ergonomics, I've already done it in the sitting position.
to make more comfort.
For Jesel, a visually impaired person.
I made a dress that she could use in many ways.
From top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote her name in arms.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal ...
We would always think about making blogs and labelets in armile so people could have access to some basic information.
Like the size and color of the play.
Then, what about him?
It's not the same.
What about women with low-scale anism?
The ideal.
They put us in pieces, in an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
My excitement in this work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued.
This is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news ...
It's that businesses are already thinking.
Are they producing more modern products?
As colorful wheelchairs.
Are you ready?
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion competition, including the world.
You're already in the décima edition.
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I...
Silvana ...
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
That the big companies...
Special and conceptual marks that realized the real need of this dressed room.
They're already launching collections and including them.
How does the Americans take?
And it's already in your second inclusive collection due to the size of success that was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Why will we be?
All equals.
Our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
My family always came from the rock.
I always liked being in the middle of the forest.
My life?
In the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
He went to work with the children.
Children aged four years old.
(Video) Until adolescence, and goes through adulthood.
My community, we started working with the said ...
I was conscientizing people, how ...
What's that about?
Knowing to separate one trash from the other.
So I tried.
Conversing with children?
She was making awareness of her parents.
"Dad, what were they catching?"
By delivering me to children?
Does the name recognize in the community?
I studied only until 8th grade, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school for me to graduate.
But nowadays I feel like an educator.
"And ...?"
I do with the children I know.
In my community...
We have one ...
A seed collection when you go to the forest?
I'll work with SAF.
We have a plant.
There?
I met a plant called Hengar's name.
Is it a legominous plant?
We plant everything.
On top of it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
All the plants I eat.
How many below it?
We...
It has a good result.
And our community?
"When I went to my arms?"
There I met.
All plants.
It was used every one of its place.
But I tried to imitate like a huge forest.
So you have to imitate forests.
Why?
There in the arm.
Was there a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So, I tried to plant them.
Sharing.
(Laughter) There I have the aaiu, the cup, the gray, Andiróba, Copaiba.
In Maru.
Now love it.
It's all there no plague.
We come there.
In the arms, everything natural, I saw there was a lot of poison, very toxic.
"Mom, bro.
And the fruit aside?
Comparation of ours.
In our community?
We work all there because of organic molecules.
Everything is natural.
There's no tox in our community.
I?
Comparate human beings?
Like an animal.
The child compared her and, just paying.
She speaks, she's there listening, and then she passes to other children.
Popaguai was watching this attention.
Then, he talks about animal quote.
So, I compare the child like this.
And share with your human being?
We have to be patient, we have to show love, we have to have affection.
"Mom, do I care for those kids?"
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
It was putting everything on the axis.
"Dad, say this.
The first lesson we have to pass on to the person has to come from us.
So, I'm a person who always goes where I live, I keep observing.
A person?
And I look at my house.
What I'm observing at home and... Audience: What am I observing?
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Coisa leaves us there, everything is fine.
So, did I see that all this that my work was doing with children?
A future.
And it would work out.
And today we have ...
Is it a job inside?
I think it's far from the atom.
"The atomans' shoes?"
When I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom?
Taruga from the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replying the river, what was it before?
I had a hooligan.
Especially.
That's how it's a little bit like our community.
And ...
This "hoolig" she crossed and...
It ended with the river.
And today we have the people who saw it.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're managing.
Living with nature.
To understand nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I'm going to talk to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
The forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel it?
Yes, guys.
They saw pure air there.
So, I, my experience in the forest ...
It's always being talking to people teaching children.
And ...
Transforming with other people.
And I have a message to leave here.
The phrase that she's very small?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, I reach people ...
What do you see?
Have we ever approached us?
Let's talk about it, how do we bring people into practice?
And I'm very happy.
I'm like this, "If I don't pass ...
My message, my education for other people, I feel even guilty.
Thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) Thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) Thank you very much.
(Music) I'm gay.
In contrast with the name, I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Germaine these children.
It's very proud.
In my family, it's very grateful for these women who helped us.
To make this dream come true.
to create this family.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a meldisplasida melody and a seed layer.
And that ...
They come to the life of their risk.
Imagine all the most blind people who are here, as we feel.
It's like a fear that has lost our child.
And we had two options.
Our funding, crying, or...
Resolver, fight.
Believing, faith, strength and continuing looking for an ugly melody.
Let's go.
For him, to be able to make a transplant of fear, what he needs for himself.
It's peculate.
So ...
It was really incredible because all the schools and friends of all of us.
They made a whole movement.
Very big, sharing the press, social media, everywhere, letting people play blood, and founded modules.
Very amazing, it was a very beautiful movement.
This movement made us think that Tancreta, through this disease.
It gave us a very important message for all of us.
First for us and for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
When a child bounces you and has a risk of life.
All or remain the problems of fears, of concerns.
It doesn't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters.
Do we learn how to be a salt?
And it spread to our friends, to the most of school, to society, people on Facebook.
by saying, "It's true, it doesn't matter the problem I had."
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he passed through this disease, as public as well, and all this movement found a donor.
Is it?
And people?
They saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
A family that is loved and welcomed, which is equal to all these families.
At the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be in the family, or a living father?
Or a warmer divorce?
The important thing is the love of the family, this union, that gives the strength.
This that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranchède passed to us.
With this disease for the world.
And what?
My blood, my heart made great.
We can make them.
Our factory.
The blood is blind.
I'm a human being able to give to another human.
He raised such a big awareness.
We have this ability.
Doubing blood so that it needs and releases it's not just that.
For someone who has a house, I don't go out.
Tanga needs itself in parts.
When we have an accident, at any moment, everyone is processing, they need.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a donor and a patient, it's one ...
About 6,000 people.
So, if you ...
To save a life is like winning a mega-senha.
From life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when he walks out of three...
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment of power, if I waited for them to call me so that I can save in life, if me, more strength, without any pain, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's just one thing.
More beautiful, and it's the message that ...
Or so creative?
I thank you all.
(Laughter)
Or to support ourselves by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save the life of such a credit, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
It's called Laikon.
You looked at it.
Basically, it's like you.
This is exalition.

In front of the Portuguese.
That's why.
That's the scout.
In some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today ...
I'll talk about...
What bothers me the most.
Procansetto.
Who exists about swimming?
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with Islam.
A “X of war.”
That is, it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
It's a garage.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was from Vinci.
Three million.
It should be people.

My family.
My friends I knew about this child.
Three clothes shoes.
Homo Escultory of Engineering.
Two apartments.

For countries like the United States.
Banha.
It's France.
Until I love the day.
The war began.
March gifts.
Two thousand 11.
Interesting.
Well, that's it.
I arrive to all other cities.
In the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I'd handed, twenty ...
It's 25.
There you go.
Every day.
How good!
Five years of war.
This is my country.
Incredible.
That's the opposite.
Who I know were, thank you.
Carrica.

His children.
They found themselves.
Two bubbles?
Swed and mutilated.
Or, a bomb.
Familiares.
This is going to look.
And they didn't come back.
His last years.
In the series, they were very difficult.
I didn't know if it was.
I know and it's going back home.
"When leaving, hug working?"
Then my family came back again.
Or not?
Today ...
Millions of Syrian.
They asked everything.
They were dead or refugeed in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad.
When should we leave Syria?
Well, our hooligans.
And our life takes you back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still live there.
And I don't know.
He'd let you come.
They, again.
to protect my family.
I went to Barraba Irute.
Well, ten months...
It's about how Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
Tao!
I talked to the Brazilian ambassad.
And they gave up.
Nampaule.
It was the best city.
To go.
In Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
There were names.
A week, shine back.
"Firty years old."
From my life.
And I started again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here in December 2013, with my family.
Two children.
Oriald, 11 years old.
And it was.
With a lot, today I have a daughter.
Brazil is Lerinha.
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party.
Just like living.
My children's birthday.
They've all talked very well.
From the food that I made my good ones.
They talked, button.
Adviting who is the kitchen.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created "Dagine on Facebook," "The Talk with my Syria idea," that's why now.
Everything has pen and paper.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
(Laughter)
We're happy in Brazil.
We thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened the doors when the world ...
It was closed.
For us.
Etress, because of war and attacks.
Two chorists.
Many people.
I had a wrong idea about Syrian.
About self-esteem.
Today, in the morning, here.
Or a journalist says to me,
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, by talking.
Or contact?
As a homosexual.
A human.
A lot!
I'm Islam loves blood.
What is allowed to kill?
Inome of religion.
But exactly ...
Or the diving.
Or TAC, what happened in Paris?
It was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us.
The Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization.
that is arising Islam's image.
A basic religion.
Or Alcurão?
I'm not a book.
Unpleasant, ten.
In killing or one person.
That she had killed another, hurt, corruption, on the earth, and as if all men were killed.
And he, in life, knows?
Zera suffers from deceiting life to all men.
Alcurão.
Give your corn, see school, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely.
How am I?
My life in Brazil -
It showed me.
Can we?
Let's live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A type of fight in three Syrian.
And Brazilians.
Even like differences.
Culture and religion.
When people see a woman using "hijabi"?
That handkerchief that covered my hair.
Anyway, my wife is my wife.
Do you ask questions like?
Why do you use this silence?
With that heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline Tirai Jabi.
Today, read other rules.
Men and women.
I won't even get touched."
To start.
Immediate.
It's just sex, voice.
From wedding.
Some people told me.
But I've already seen humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Let's see, Islam has these rules.
Moreover, from each person wants to buy, or not?
The library is fine.
Some things to be.
It's the same way, they have to be irritated.
Who doesn't obey everything.
It's not good to have mexed as a battle of cake into alcohol drinks.
When I arrived in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "Yes?
It's "you" bebi-alcool.
Oh, it was sex!
With more than a partner.
This is not happening practically.
Why?
Because these things are done.
And Islam.
Our religion is very important for music.
But...
Despite not knowing Moisla.
And then?
Because the agency explains those of you always.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Professor Mohammaddez."
Yes, we must respect.
All religions.
That everyone has the same value.
What should we have?
Beautiful.
With all of us.
It doesn't matter.
Except white.
Black?
Or Indians.
Oislam also says.
that we should help the people who need it.
Everything is great, Alsaka.
And we get paid.
Two points, five, percent.
All our money for people.
But poor.
There's no company.
Being the poor are the humans.
Chrystalos, today I gave.
A fear to you: to learn more.
About Islam.
I'm sure.
What it was like to understand is a basic religion.
It's now my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows better Islam.
To finish.
with "Oubrecent."
"Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children?
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is the molecule?
(Applause)
(Applause) In small scores of life.
They come to recite my tears.
In the emerging sun in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up on the stairs of those who always expect cancer.
Who believes they have always achieved?
I don't believe, I soon lose hope.
But, in the daily cave, I know who suffers.
There the bags make food, my salary ends, just like this race.
All the girl was what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
The service opportunity had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Passineer.
What don't hire me in the mall, I don't understand, this makes me so much to pay a secret course?
Who's in the office?
I apologize, as I was wrong, I did.
to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation: Deo, ME, ICT, be a maid.
I have everything good, I have several friends.
So, in this situation they got conformed, but I didn't.
To be new areas.
The lunch gave me an opportunity.
And the teacher told me.
See this corridor, react, turn to the left, enter that little side that the vessor is waiting, welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011.
I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, "I'm a maid."
The page I created on Facebook.
And the cotton came up in July 2016.
Even this year, she hadn't even completed four months.
And since I wanted this page, it wasn't programmed, I was on vacation house.
I'd go away from day to day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my running life.
I was told in the sofa, remembering all I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach's topic, almost in front of me.
And remembering all I achieved, I also remember when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook, how the daily one?
"Wow!", right?
I put everything that happens, my mother even fights with me, "Menine, all you can do Facebook, is tomorrow, it's my new diary."
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
which I was a maid for seven years.
And then I warned them to the gallery, guys, "I came to my memory, some reports, I'll start ...
Put this on Facebook and use the hashtag and the maid.
For this case, other people have gone through this too, compassionate, and it's easy for me to keep following that everyone writes.
I'm always talking about the past.
For my surprise, in less than 24 hours, this went viral very fast.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story on the Internet, it was a reference to my last job as a maid in Santos city.
This is in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food.
I had to bring the container, I couldn't use the cup at her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared ...
This first story on the Internet went viral very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
Because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories and not today's stories.
Imagine, it's less than four months old, as I said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I interviewed several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London's babies, the German TV Dábio and many others.
And I was surprised when I spoke to these reputters.
Let's travel to Skype, than everyone.
All of us.
All of them got very emotional.
When I started talking about the situation of domestics here in Brazil.
And then they managed to break and I started talking about these stories because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
domestications are more valued, they earn more.
For hour, so completely different here in our country.
I also receive many abusive advertisements in my page.
And it gives employment announces that I've tried as abuse announces, for example.
A story I read?
It was for workers and working secondly.
"Oh, Friday."
At 8 am.
At 18 hours.
They earned 38 Brazilian reals.
One day, week, much less.
Both.
3180 reals per month, which is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestications going through these conditions still today, there are domestications that are being prevented from feeding.
They also don't earn food, there are domestications.
I couldn't use the bathroom and suffer all these atrocities.
I've always mentioned there on the website.
More for these seven years.
There were many oppressions stories.
However, in one single house had it.
And I found something I call humanized treatment.
And it's Regina, and soon when I got home ...
I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did.
I entered a room with a gigantic library, and I always liked reading, but even today books are very expensive.
And my mother, my father and a wallet, couldn't buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started stealing.
This became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, gathered everything quickly, left half an hour to clean, to the TV?
(Laughter) And there, sit down, delicizing me with those books.
And, to my surprise, Regina comes in the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe brave, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And knowing about the experiences I had experienced in the past ...
I was very nervous, and then she sat there with me and said, "Wow, you're interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I've read many books, I want to understand the history of the world."
Then she started to spread several texts.
And in 2009, when I entered the university, I got to read in the university as well.
So, what I call humanized treatment in 2009, was very difficult.
To help the university ...
With the lines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no.
Following mensality.
And, thanks to some teachers and several class friends, who ...
that helped me, I summarized some texts.
I pay attention to getting into the room to show that it's very difficult to see, a very heavy job with...
It's the studies.
And then, for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the cassette of the Brazilian traditional family and showing that slavery isn't over yet.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool.
But...
There was in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me.
In the 60s, he created the first union of domestications.
And she was known by the media of the time as the horror of the ladiums.
All of this when I eat and exhibit some reports?
The person says, "Wow, it's very heavy."
Anyway, today, I came here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe.
Only through the adversity that we can change some things.
No one will follow the path with a little stone.
"Wow!", right?
Why?
Most of the workers ...
Domestics in Brazil, 79 victims are 6%.
According to the 19th of 2013, there are black women.
And that?
It can't be the only condition for black women.
This place.
It's a job like anybody, yes.
Fifty and three percent of the population is black too, right?
I'm here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a maid, and I was also a maid.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I couldn't understand, but she knew that everything that happened ...
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I too.
I would also pass.
Because I also took a long time to understand that curriculum with a picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood that, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least, an interview.
She'd put a suspension after her pregnancy, OK?
I had a suspense of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on.
What about you?
Yes.
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I say that what the big house was in the past ...
These are luxury apartments today.
And it was the domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past without a distant past, it's very close to us.
They are the housemaid today.
The modern Madonna?
It's the maid's petitd.
It came.
I cried, cried, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to come: "You're fairy day of payment, I hear her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door, my pattern came."
And when I get there...
I was already wearing the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, so she arrives and says,
It was so strange, "Wow, I forgot to get your money, Monday I pay you."
Modern coast is the maid's breast.
My girl, I created her since I was little, with so much zen and affection, her mother was always going to work, and there was no time for her.
All the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I just wanted to see, she got married, just that, but unfortunately they didn't invite me to the wedding, but as I am deaf.
I put my best clothes.
I went to the church, I was hiding, and I saw my girl getting married, because the modern cord is the maid'sast, is Christmas, I'm seeing my father's family having fun, everybody happy.
And sadness knocked me.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern Madonna ...
It's almost the one from the maid.
The worst moment of my life is when my boss will work.
He's going to work, he takes his wife to work.
He tells his wife who is going to work, but he goes back.
What is the house?
To hide me.
The only solution I had was to remove copies from all over the world.
So, if I'm going to clean the bedroom, I'm blank.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can run away from him.
Because when I say that I'll change jobs, my friends say, "Men, stay, do you make 18,000 per month?"
You will never gain this value somewhere else."
And I stay here resisting because I left my children a Northeast, and they need this money.
What about modern age?
It's the maid's petitd.
I just arrived at a new service.
My tiny glass was treated.
The sugar drop is my pnico.
I was there.
When I got out of the service area, tired, I got my glass pot.
I did this in number one.
And my pattern saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?"
Using the ice cream and the bathroom, what's happening, no, your bathroom can use the bathroom, and there wasn't the employee bathroom that's why I brought the lemon.
Why modern age?
It's the maid's petitd.
Today I'm here.
Statistics.
For some people, in my place, it would be there in faxine.
Because, when I told my boss that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said this.
"Menine, you have to be happy where you are."
To pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but her mother wasn't a domestic, she was already predestined for her family to serve.
So, you have to be happy, being a woman, so I'm here, I'll tell you the statistics, "Black woman."
Remember... (Applause) HEP, peripheral.
Black woman, black woman.
Chorus!
ME: It's here.
And the side!
I wasn't doing here today.
They bring 6 million households.
That should be here next to me.
At some point they will be.
What can I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But it's only about seeing that six million houses are being represented now, and that many aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch, because they're there, cleaning, that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, many patterns and some domestic ones.
Isn't it?
If each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships.
We'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries various domestications work and study, and here this housework has a private property, we can see at the airports, "Why does the nanny have to be dressed as white?"
It's an uniform, yes, to be able to identify it, so inside the house, does the boss know it's the nanny, but it's not to be clear which are the places of some people in this country?
So I'm here with theory in statistics, I'm not alone, that I'm talking about six million houses.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
And today, to talk ...
That's it.
Silence.
And it's already a bit funny to come out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
Let me tell you.
The time of my talk first to collapse.
Listen to your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
I cried of fear.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
And it's silence.
For us human beings.
Who says that silence is a door to who we are?
Emotionally.
Who we are emotionally?
Who are we really?
If you don't allow yourself?
Look at you in the silence of your mind.
You will never know who is right."
Four years ago...
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing twelve, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
Marcelo has already started?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Fluxism."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Sure?
And I had it.
Around 30 years of yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Open the agenda.
This is oil.
It's insecurity and equipment.
I place inflammation points.
The first step ofuriation.
Wow!
At the moment, the pain went to the next level.
And I was sure I didn't go from the account.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote.
I'd talk like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 military years, I discovered that I never work.
It had been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
That feeling, from that moment of presence ...
And it's the moment you're not.
It's the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
Even you.
That is the human being.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
There are no beliefs, no sex.
It's a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
I found.
It was fear.
Much less.
It was very angry.
This is not in body.
It was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, various emotions.
And I didn't know that I lived a great one of me.
They were the consequence of history.
Everything I'd already lived.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
I was determining my choices.
Right now, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
"You agreed with your greatest."
Several of you?
And I thought, "Oh!
No, I don't need it."
Others justified the importance of it.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you.
Put your cell phone off because all of you have.
You listen to me.
You all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
It turns off.
See this space.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
Put them on the floor ... (Audience) Aaaaaaaahh!
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your bags on the floor.
What about it?
Do you close your computer?
You, with the lettuces connected, close them.
And you who were noticing in notebooks, closing your notebooks for a moment.
With everything?
Fechado.
You are not disconnected.
You took the tool closely from you.
The lack of connection.
Those who connect is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back.
Look at me ...
Look.
Propal.
And then, look.
On the other human being that you have on the right and left.
It's a good look at this way.
You're good, you've got a little gun.
Audience: Good afternoon.
He was connected, guys.
Look, folks!
Do you see where they are?
They saw it.
Do you remember?
Do you see?
Audience: Yes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Wow, legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Very closed?
Some of you will have.
A distant from resistance.
A resistance that's born.
For fear.
It's not fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Because this guy, right now, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's real fear.
The fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
They give me space.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Remember the ceiling?
Remember that ...
Two dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
In the human brain, we are connecting space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have it.
The strong sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a piece is different.
I'm sure you are.
It's wishing.
Do you know where you are and leaving the localization system connected?
Feel where you are.
Feel the chair.
Do you remember when you were kids?
Do you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You'd sit the temperature and take your fingers to Chica's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
I am, yes.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The field.
That you take care.
In this room.
It's good the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
In front of you, the area you take.
Open your eyes.
It's strange.
"No."
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality.
Is it new?
How new it is, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence?
This one can account.
And much of what we do is specific.
What we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
To have a real freedom of choice.
The silence and a state of presence that comes from it.
It can become.
A habit in our lives?
Technologies of self-knowledge.
There you go.
In the planet.
Together with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
And all of them.
Are you available?
They're simple.
But these are technology.
Get more generation.
We already know.
And in the future, there is evolution of race.
Communication will be.
direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today just to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate.
Autenticity.
For another autensity.
Silencing is a source of freedom.
Edexte.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in love with a TEDx talk that activates the first video.
(Laughter)
And, normally, it's the good look.
How was my case?
I can say that I'm an absolutely lasting revelation.
The walls are so serutive that the idea is translated.
We took part in a demand for a childhood and ideas region.
And they asked other societies.
In London, shared.
Your friends, your colleagues, your family.
In Brazil's case.
And a translation work?
It's fundamental.
Once more than just one.
Five percent of people according to the protestate behavior: "I am."
Five percent, or less.
It has an influence in English.
How does she mean when?
The producer is the key.
And it's possible to have a door in this gap of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators around the world.
Ten percent of them are Brazilians.
translating to 116 languages.
And, almost all the time, 6,000 translations made up until the moment.
But we not only translate.
As we also get through.
The talks made and elements like these here.
The transcession work is very important, not only to bring our TEDx to the world.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment?
They can follow the content of the talks.
When the talk is not given in English.
It was my case here, in Portuguese.
First, it's transcribed.
The laws of an original man.
To then be verified for me, instead, and English is that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
"Tech" with its own logotype in Chica.
To put our legs as Pedro Ted's technology.
Interfering, which is "e," that we can translate as entertainment.
And had to get out?
Paulo referred to each other.
At present ... (Audience) At present!
The talks.
They remember the inferiority of subjects that go from excellent over the whole, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship.
and even literature.
We have, for example.
Species that come back at times of chance.
Another of my passions.
Looking at what "disages" is this accident with the goal.
Is that free time we have?
It's not only expensive.
For our biggest life expectancy?
It's also the reduction of the human work journey throughout the stories.
I think they jumped that one of the facts I make of my hearing loss -
It's to translate and realize how I look.
Thank you.
There's no test bubbles.
And it can be.
The "terrox" talks, TEDx ...
Seriously, they are considered curious educational.
"Ah, you need to have children."
Very few.
I do this not only.
Because translating is a passion, and the father is in a stadium word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is a "sedex," but to be "trox", is going to be from him.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember the translator ...
It's a living reader desired.
Not only do they help me deal with anxiety, but a very anxious person.
Isn't it just a winner?
Sometimes, Ogigo hired me, "Only, but half an hour and look at the boyfriend, two treasures went by and this happens to me in other sectors."
Not only because I had such tactic people, but I'm getting to know at this event.
I'm an assistant.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive precedent.
In initiatives like this one.
That you want.
According to the philosopher, "Edm than Frome."
A bugs appreciate man's hearing in life.
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
Does it light for yourself?
And to become what is meant, essentially, that I didn't come from education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I have no doubt that education is fundamental.
Why do people, less privileged, with good crimes, excluded to our society?
They can insert themselves in a dignity way in our society.
And when I ask for volunteer work, I think it's the donation work.
Be the acid time?
Be the air, your knowledge.
What if we help an object?
Just with your volunteer work.
Because I've always my choice, my decision.
I have to do the best way possible.
And try to commit myself.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different from the same as works and remains of our time.
The translation of complex activities that demand not only to know.
My foreign woman, the fights source, but mainly.
Our language.
And somehow, we play this time.
behind a well-known translation.
There's always.
A part of the knowledge of the beginning.
It changes research.
Many jobs, a lot of dedication.
And for us, a fluent translation, to be ours, to be kiss?
There's always a degree of the worst distress.
And frustrated with what?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved in almost between definitions.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
But, nevertheless, we believe in the quality of our translations.
Not only about the speaker, but about those who will watch, OK?
And to guarantee this humanity, all the translations and transcessions?
They went through a revision, made by the volunteers themselves.
It seemed, finally.
They are used by a language called "ordinector," or the coordinator of a barge.
Or as we call "Por un LC".
In Brazil's case of Brazilian Portuguese, Juncia O Portuguese in Portugal, which is very different.
We have 1016 of which I'd like to be here named.
I read stories.
Are we there in Miamã?
We have Maricene.
Claudia.
What am I doing?
We have our boys.
And just because I was in my left?
Gustavo.
The toy or luck.
And Rafael?
(Audience) A good world.
This obsession I have with education?
Actually?
I have to hear it.
Not only with Brazil.
What do I live there?
A profound, political crisis, is that education is employed.
Audience: Good afternoon.
But without my finger, with my exchange, this is personal.
(Applause)
My father, who would have been two years now, if he was said, didn't estimate primary school.
Despite this, he knew the term "bem" and did the four characteristics very well.
And their dream was to always be able to study language because I'm studied.
and make their children study.
That's why he who lived our neighbor called "Tairobeias."
He decided to change for his four kids at the time, I stop very strange, the biggest city than girls.
In some places, my father had come from his start, his logic, Uberas, has his place.
Knowing that, as a businessman, he learned that the role had a presence store, there was a year-old restaurant.
In the instant.
In 1964, there was a great version for Brazil.
Because of this exception, and other reasons, my father went to the lack and lost.
"Oh, it's just us."
Audience: Yes.
He stayed, literally, without any years, like nothing, we have nine books.
(Applause)
One felt very humble with his economic failure, and my father decided.
After paying these damages.
If you change bedrooms, like a front or behind you, you can eat really enjoyed loving.
In Belo Horizonte?
My mother, who's now 30 years old, is in the area?
Besides being an expectation for Paráito Games, I still have a church.
It was not to know about cooking.
She needed training and wrote, and she decided to do "consects" to sell.
So, for so many years, at home ...
The queijo pan was literally caio-pal, say it's passing on the best pains of riding pedalizers.
(Applause)
So although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't give up.
We are explorers to study.
And how about that?
It was done.
A big question, without a doubt, because I already agreed with data from the prison of national research by Men's friendship.
In the 48-year-old crossing, in Brazil's 60s?
Only 32% of people with greater solidarity than me, yes, fundamental.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education?
Transparency?
In the smaller days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself.
standing up.
During seven years of age, at that time, we generated the alphabetization at seven.
A caderno body prevents, where the chaffinyprodozone came out, a prize, the premise that appeared at home.
You can imagine ... Then I'm getting in, shaking in words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest spantorized to parochia.
But for my father, they would check their babies.
Without knowing?
And he was practicing a little for this talk here.
I left.
My five siblings and I managed to give up, but we got more than that today we managed to give to our own.
When the dreams are better, what did we have?
And here I say, to me, the greatest passion in my program's life, are my two children: Danieel, the young Henrique.
My parents never put it on my chair to have a newspaper for me.
But why did I question all the nights?
To have stories before sleep.
It's always a pleasure for me.
And for my children.
Coincident, isn't it coincidence?
Four of us, my brothers, we became teachers.
Education is, without a doubt, a seren.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is a reeducator, "Wow, for me it's fantastic, creative!"
In revolutionary ideas, that it applies in students' education to their own school.
So ...
The only message I can leave here today?
It's what we need to do.
It's education, an obsession, we have to be homicide by education.
Despite the living conditions, despite developing our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TED?
It has to do exactly.
I'm convinced that the TEDx, just like my father in his simple way.
He inspired us.
Just like today, it was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
Die.
Don't be inspired.
It's to spread ideas.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that had in our first contact with her army.
A alphabet where you can feel the things you're written.
During the vacation, we spent one afternoon with her, where they explain how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols.
And it has to teach us, but it didn't work very well because it's super conquered.
Easy, I'll forget this for a while.
But, when the classes came back, I started to be a bit asked in some classrooms and I decided to go back to college.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up saying alphabet, and I did many times.
And I stopped buying a rule.
It's a tiny that allows you to describe in braille.
On the street, you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
I wrote to her that I was learning, and it still gave me tips.
With this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, there wouldn't be thousands of processes like this, we'd get one on the Internet, and we'd be ready to connect with engines, and we'd have a clock.
But as he didn't have the Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines.
Respinos.
And they would show the hours and the minutes.
In Braille, so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaked and nothing happened, but we did it write everything, disconnected and reconnected everything and started to work.
And, about a month ago, we ended the clock.
And we showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us.
And they encourage us a lot to continue this project, to try to make a menor clock or a translator in Braille.
It was very exciting.
Every process we went through knows a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family.
It showed us how important it is to develop their own interests.
and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
I could help with sad inclusion and potentially many other people.
This showed us how much you don't need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my best you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video, our aunt, beyond the time in the clock, feeling the sounds.
And leave the message that many things seem very simple.
They weren't yet created, and if even we, two students in high school, still haven't ended up?
In middle school, we are second year old and we are teenagers.
We managed to create something innovative.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) (Music)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask you a question.
What do you think?
adult people.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Things can put your hands on the air.
OK, we're all in the corner.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is an expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relations that dance commercial relations.
It's a volunteer exchange.
In other words, there's a part that has a sexual relationship with the objective of having profit.
And another part with a goal.
They have to enjoy it.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women.
that manage their business autonomously, they publish their ads.
We received their clients.
In apartments, in hotels, or in street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm talking about.
And in good talk about cases, who involves it?
Children?
Or adults who are cooled.
Obviously, it involves me 16 or adults who didn't give sense to their consent are cases of crime.
There are cases that must be chosen, criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults that is forced, which is consistent, I also think it's a criminal case, and, always, stilherent by volunteer and processed frustration.
It doesn't come to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
The tendency is to confuse that, in this case, against sexual exploitation.
But to take all the people who do this situation with traffic victims for sexual action is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were the whole.
Research has shown that Portugal fell.
The traffic phenomenon for sexual expulsion is not very expressive. They are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but can be crossed.
To give you an idea of what I just said, which field of phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the data of the observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism.
The field Portugal gathered information about the issues related to human traffic and that, regarding the year 2016 - the latest available data - showed that in Portugal 108 traffic victims were confirmed.
Humanity.
Almost all of us for job exploration.
Vitimes for sexual harassment.
Only three.
Of course, I was hearing a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
There's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
As victims.
Defense.
Sured.
They are something that expects someone to save well.
But does this also not answer to reality, or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
Therefore, the world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economic inequalities.
socio-cultural disqualiers.
We know there's a diversity of buildings.
And influence the decision we make.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the researcher interviews, I talk, I'm with the people who work sexually.
What they say is that this was an option.
It's a hidden option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity which is profitable, but highly witnesses a dese, and it's not recognized.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think which image comes immediately to you?
(Laughter) The mind.
Do you think of a person who prostitutes?
Think about it.
OK, and I bet the majority of you thought of two situations, or of any other one.
Or a poor-speaking woman.
And from mining, who's in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
And it's very likely to be frightening and that, of course, there's someone exploring.
But this is only two stereotypes.
These are simplified images.
That they don't reflect with rigor.
The reality.
There's a huge diversity.
Of people who are in sex work.
There's a diversity of people.
Through practices.
In these experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
They are not just women.
They're not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work and there are transgender women, not only women who manage, there are also many transgents of sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Does anyone on the street?
I say that the studies that are the distance of being done.
The accidental cities.
Try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, telling us that...
Complete or place.
Because it will only represent people around 10 to 20%.
The total of people prostitate.
And when do we think about women?
We're forgetting men who do sex work.
Are they less?
They're minorities, but they're not negligible.
Let's give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greater sex worker, a study led by dreaming teacher.
I'm in the need of Lisboa.
And that interviewed 140 sex workers, both in the street context, as in the context of the inner, men, women, trans people.
That, all over the country, there would be 10 victims 2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of transcos women.
And there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
So, when the speech does.
On the victim of a man or opressor, you forget that it's a percentage.
Men, matter.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'll tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, detachment.
"What? What?"
Although it may appear.
It's an idea, apparently humanist, when we analyze negative deeply for people who do sex work.
And it's the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
From 1999.
That it's not.
Right.
Gender sex.
But it's Chinese.
The idea that's at the base.
This law.
It's that the people in the presentation are victims without exception.
So, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the person, the client, and, therefore, we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other patents after Sweden and Sweden government has spoken a quote about the great success this law and how it diminished prostitution.
But there has been very strong evidence.
In a nutshell, the non-profit organizations that work every day.
With people talking about sexual abuse, which indicates that this law puts a greater risk.
Speeders themselves put rich people for sex taste and increases gravitational health.
Violence.
The stigma.
And there is a disease.
Audience: Yes.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
They are victims ... Hum ...
Audience: Yes.
It's an idea, with no big restriction in ants, good happened.
The resources of people and this is the idea that the client is a criminal.
For an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research is administrated.
What are the voices between us?
workers of their clients and clients.
And these are complex relationships.
And that, mostly, we are abused relations.
"But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is?"
This idea that we join clients is harmful.
They are people.
They are disabled covers.
People with functional diversity or other type of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who recruit sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
They have a right.
There's your sexuality.
And it's your pleasure, and many of them, the person can do it.
A great sex professional.
There are even countries.
They have the fungal figure, the sexual assistant, who is someone who receives practice.
to know how to have sexual donations.
They are people who are the covers of people.
It's science.
I think this example.
It's quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
about the relevance of sexual work.
And now that I destroyed any argument.
What is favour?
Where is the clients' criminalization?
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to make it easy.
To your own.
What are the economic needs?
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be yours.
And she found itself on the work connections.
I don't know if this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why do we continue?
Why do I like to strongly give people who work sexually because stigmas are so intense and strong about people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
It's the cause of morality.
And specifically, moral?
Sexual?
which exhibited sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, there was a sexuality considered legitimate.
It's normal.
And natural?
And, in Portugal, we have a deaf slide considered ilogitimate.
It's normal.
Anti-natural and that's where the commerce is located from the sky.
And the fact that more than sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural is at the base.
stigmatization.
One of the essential network.
from decreidibilization, health, and disvalorization of people who do this activity.
The stigma.
It's a mark with a deep skill.
The stigma that rejects sex workers is strong, it has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence that ...
And that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers.
For example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area.
Even justice and social security and are treated with prejudice.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little fear that I don't know if someone used this word, not TEDxBas, the stigma of puta.
It's the worst that I can fall on women.
The worst offense we can drive a woman is to call her puta.
The stigma of women's life in two types: honor and honor, seriously and non- seriously, those who behave well and this one behaves bad.
And in this sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of sword from MOOCs that is above any of us, any woman knows that, if you forget, the norms that are socially prescribed, there's a risk of requering the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to step at risk.
You're called puta.
"But you don't.
What do I think we can do any of us, can we do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex gamers?
And I think that the path is the human rights of all and all including people who do sex work.
It's the way to build policies based on scientific evidence, and this was already discussed here in the morning, in scientific and empirical evidence, and not policies built from ideal assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge stigma.
But I'm here to do it right now.
And to give voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempts of silencing over time.
Do we consider sexism considerers?
So, all over the world, organized and used 70, but, precisely because of stigma, their voice has no credibility.
They didn't want to say, "We don't want compassion or tolerance crimes, we want rights."
And that's what I think the path we have to be.
After that.
And to finish.
I think it makes sense?
And it's natural.
Because we know how to continue to disrespect.
Stigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause) I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's also the good news.
But that's not true.
Art is to cure art.
It was cured, being a doctor.
And the idea could give a sustainable loss.
I do a doctor to be.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship.
Where I have to get involved individually, in such a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have father, empathy.
But, at the same time, I have to get such a distancing.
Who would allow me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment that, so I can propose.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the human relationships of our time.
They are all more superficial and more reasons that I'm seeing if balance is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgery.
In these trips I followed, many doctors also went there.
Divers times.
Where did we get there?
In our arrogance ...
From "Brazilian hell," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear India.
It's a mythispeute index.
From there, I found myself in a feeling that I didn't have since childhood.
to relate to someone who needed my knowledge to do and to be able to offer to that person?
That involvement, that love?
This kind of service.
He's polite.
Bruji.
And this convention, the Indian and schedule request.
Honorai.
All the doctors who go with us and go back.
Eroquys.
We bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
It's not like that.
It's simple, it's there.
It can be replicated here too.
She's the grandmother because she needs to go to a middle of the Amazon to discover this.
So, I traveled to myself and why did I find out?
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical university before.
Have you made a list of topics of all student's goals?
The first objective is:
I went to see.
It's even good.
These same students at the end of the Medical Court.
With the same research?
But signs are success and knowledge.
Sorry.
Some when we did it wrong.
If we got someone who had a poetic scope?
We handed a technical person who knows a lot about medicine, but he doesn't know anything about us.
The worry about the previous medical relationship with medicine refers to the past.
Nadresce.
Pietro, in medicine, where the father is in medicine, which is "póx."
It doesn't mean that medicine was not done before.
When Dão played with the apple, Eva desengascheoi, and that was to make a leg trip, that's what we do until today, it didn't touch the same thing.
So why is Greece considered, instead of medicine and little your father in medicine because for the first time?
We must have a method there.
It can transform the art of healing something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And in such a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion too, it was developed and it was created an increase of psychocrates.
And even today it's used in medicine formatures.
In the world, a 7th Cristo had been done.
It's good, of course.
If you stopped three words, that is, there are slightly complex words.
In all houses I entered, I just said to see the exercise of the patients.
Exiting all the volunteer and corruption damage, especially the sedution of women, men, children and surroundings.
What you saw to hear respectfully the lives of the patients in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that it doesn't convince you to be published, to keep silencing as a religious secret.
It's respecting this law and not violating it, it would be the dignity of equality and reputation between men in all times.
And if I bring the violin revolves, what happens the opposite?
Why, at that time, was you worried about this, and you still do a dinner?
We do judgement of things we thrive because we have to be thrilled, because the patient's medical relationship is essential for a good cure.
So, isn't it?
Today, few things are taken with honor judgment.
And, in this case, I was honored to participate in a position that is registered to a judgment of waves.
Medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produced science so that the neighbour could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable?
and absorb all knowledge.
So, today, a patient has a doctor's team because he takes care of him.
One actor and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we'll specialize a lot, incurate this and lose the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in class in college, in class with small groups, like teachers.
And ...
I stayed with Spanish processes, patients with aography, resonance, in two piecologies, and the other action.
I'll look for their belly, I'm taking their awareness at home.
"Oh, I'm not less composing either."
She called me a bit, called my class and said, "Let's see the patient's belly."
He looked and had to hit the patient's finger, telling what was smoking and saying he didn't smoke anymore.
The five hole showed that he had emagreced.
As these in the skin are bright, you can have fun.
And he's able to take care of his own clothes, a dirty blessing, he can say a lot, "The time when you're mexing in a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he has, he can remember something that doesn't teach us, and he said, "If all this doesn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing patients.
He's here exposing to sewing the vulnerable area, he's testing you to move in it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to speak not verbally to him, to be careful with him, to be mixed up in black people, to be good, he who you're asking for permission, stop taking care of you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, libraries, Christmas, who are stuck on their lap, are appeared, improved faster and have a more precocently evil.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases in our environment, the same employees, a house that we don't know why it appears.
There is no surgery operation, there are no amistantic changes, no rays, diseases that are symptoms.
As I said, what happens is that our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised your hand and say,
It's interesting to talk about the patient's relationship.
But to be a drug dealer, I'm patient, and to be patient is to be passive.
Why are you talking about this to me?
What you're going to say to a group of minds, because, after all, the act of the relationship are not doctors.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two habits.
Here in the same sick counts.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive, and we have to hold our hands, which was our cure process.
And it's not only going to look for healthy life, but also to engage in the process of healing, in decisions for the healing process.
To do this?
The first point, the most important, is information.
Where are we talking about Dr. Google, who is fashionable, is not fashionable, when I was a child, had many copies of the size in my house, medicine and health?
I had a book, a health book.
I only existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to convince someone, publish something, because it's a editor - you had to have content to talk.
Nowadays, with Google, you have a lesson of information, many of them are very good and very important, but many, very bad.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the ability to filter.
So, there are some things we need to think about, to see the information first.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1.3% of people join my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge call.
Because people get there, listen to what I have to say, they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they must have for nothing, and that said to me, "Man, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, or they live "medio" or other things like this.
And then?
It's a sign.
Second very important thing: don't believe in good things, make violators.
Look, medicine has changed, now their problems have over.
Usually this nursery.
Differently a lab with a scientist will have a disturbing and immediate discovery without society identifying itself.
It's not killing this for a long time.
The information runs, no one is on its own, so there's nothing I discovered today, tomorrow it's on the Internet and my doctor, when I don't know, silly.
Third.
If we have a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know that.
It's silly in which the information dominates.
It's hardly some other interest and exclusion behind, so these things from my paranoid were the president of my hand.
For a long time.
The idea is information: discuss to your doctor, he's there for that.
Inform in the midst of knowledge, information and information is knowledge.
Take the information, participate in their cure, but spread the doctor's cost.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura.
Yes.
Ask, demand, know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves.
There's a right to know what risk in that surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, in a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to attend me, I work 20 years in October."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of...
To exist, not to get there fighting with everyone, not a little teacher, not that.
Really, knowing.
To exist: composting with good we go with.
To make atendments different.
The methods want that.
They want the right loss.
They don't want to have this attempt, or their names at the time, they want to take care of the car.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in the window, near Venezuela, pre-munhosa, the area was mom.
And we had a patient there, he had sneakers cancer.
It's a lobo.
Thank you very much.
And there was no orthopologist with us from Crocele to São Paulo, which is being treated here in the future of cancer.
Oops.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to follow his consultation.
It was an Indian who didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't speak well in humans.
He had a translator, his neighbor's son who spoke very good, Portuguese, how bad he was.
He was obviously furniture.
And I made a consultation.
And for me, I'd give you a movie scene.
The index looked at the doctor.
Isn't it?
Fear was.
Why?
Very well.
Audience: Good afternoon.
When I'm trying to tell you why, at that moment, magic happened.
Have you been debated?
Without stretching the language without having a completely different culture than the other.
He enters his soul, that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of him.
This magic?
It's the art of a short manner.
There's no need to tell a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At this moment we talk, I'm proud to think that there are doctors working in few products, in ambulants, in office, here.
It's the anonymous he wants.
Doing what?
Taking a good fight.
Excuse me, paying attention.
So.
We, doctors.
I have to try to find it.
Another unity is our treatment.
It's a concern.
All patients.
The active pleasure in your cure process.
And this makes me have a connection.
You'll see the world more and better, and you'll be more invented because of this.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Sigh)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'd have 5,000 ... Good morning, guys ... (Laughter) I wanted to talk to Mulherv.
What does physics happen isn't it?
AC: This number is the number of decisions that human beings make every day.
And it takes about a decision for two seconds.
There are people in us.
The autistic pain is the same time in the decision.
For those who pay attention and talk, talking about decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing the world of decisions, changed my grandmother to make decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this recurrence magazine.
The journals were three emotions in this nature.
A digital city with 59 dollars.
A printed magazine structure, the Servinho Ciculares, which is a structure that is the most printed digital way to be also winners.
The result of this medicine is that the majority of people chose how you are 25 dollars.
I like these experiments a lot.
The values are the designers and the others.
For the second group, it was only a life of two options.
Digital movement, 59 hours.
And Sam do Combo with the R 25 Dores too.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option.
When they told me about this experiment, I wanted to think that this option of the means of living beings at USD is a printed notion.
Who didn't choose?
What did this choice change, most people chose the other?
And that left me very uncomfortable.
Why did I have more to launch and I wouldn't make that decision?
I started to study about it.
You must know a lot about it and discover that this person has inside the man.
It relates to the eye.
She said, "You don't want to return, it's not equation."
To influence the restaurant one decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economy and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive School and neuroscience applied the decision-making.
I won a formula like this, interesting, you got there.
Imagine, you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the terrible option.
You can already see something past.
This is your middle, makes your hamber, it seems to be better, so that what I'd always pay and feel of them.
Our company, if I can have two to the same.
This is impressive because I started questioning myself through social networks and everything.
And a TED Talk that made me understand everything.
Her name is to make a comparison.
And these behaviors were they before today.
Skeletons of water seems a big disaster.
The symbol Azuldo Alzquedo seems a little bigger than I use in the right year.
Can't you?
How do I have around me?
To have dinner, I like to do the train.
The truth is that October 29th died.
But we see it in a different way because I have around the cycle.
And there's another optical accomplishment that I was fascinated by going.
This is the kind of construction site on top.
And they are equal to chess pieces and low.
It was then that you'll do your problem before changing all of this.
But I'm going to show you what it is to see.
Without today's faces and only by meditating the bottom, we see that they're really good.
When I see this presentation, it's better that I understood it makes some sense to say it's around us.
In the same way that what is around us and influence the way we see things, what is around us also affects most of all the decisions.
I work in technology.
I didn't know where to avoid working in a project to create an application through insurance.
She said to me, "It's very obsession, and Marcelo's life exploded.
You can choose these two options, from three or these two.
They didn't have that, tell each other.
We were working and they said that in exasts and 11 possibilities of choice.
And the team I was working, ended up being the way to make this choice happen to people.
This way, she was said goodbye to another profession, if the person was a whole work, she would say these three options.
People said, "Of course, I want to see these three donations."
It was then fighting for them to be the concept of the Forbes magazine.
I have just realized that there are people.
that make the drawing of architecture of decisions where I'm walking in decisions.
And that caught my attention.
In the world of technology, there's even the name of this profession, it's called YO Ex.
And the Researchers or the experience of the eyes brings people exactly.
They are the architects of the decisions, working with the decision-making architecture, shocking all the format and environments that are living in all the decisions.
GDP is that, for this man and mine, if it's logical to find one day with this building, his face is him, he's the person who was a burden in this subject of behavioral economy.
He sent me this door and said, "Look, I found it isn't cold."
I told him about these theories you have to bring the knowledge of the behavioral economy to the digital world, and he started superconfused, who wants to start with you, and I judge Gilherme and see a flag to him.
What really changed my renovation of seeing is behavior.
I think we have a lot of research to know that we use our cell phones a lot.
And everybody is Barcelona, our pocket, the egg is from our pocket, look at it.
Men will go because students have a great job.
Isn't it something like the people with their smartphones?
He picked smartphones for 22 hours, nearby.
Let yourself lose and think about it, it has an enormous work.
And these 35,000 decisions happen that we make.
How many use are digital decisions?
The students established the Russian editors of one or even with the digital.
Or that the digital medicine often isn't these neurons.
I started to ask myself about this.
Did I bone Google and researched and eat a person?
Literally, she is drawing what I am.
Will everybody change?
And we said, "Of course, that's not it."
The country chooses the path we'll say, "Does the bathroom know the region or we won't describe the book?"
How many decisions are we talking about, screaming power?
Now, the world is digitally taken by us.
Is Wes?
(Applause)
(Laughter) And they are the only ones.
Talking about programs, I should talk to you about another at IADSE.
It's a wall that gives Austria, it's 91%, and in the area called Equada with the center.
You may ask how I thought this was and say, "It's the number that will be free."
(Laughter) It's not well, it's not strange. In these cases, it's the name of donors and robots.
You must know this number asking me, "Why does the other have 99% of surveillance pain?"
In Austria, you're already from Diobo.
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a magic word called "defol."
This word is what you're already.
without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call "disions of capital of birth," "You need to ask to leave."
Someone is already far from the drawing that you have to go there and come out.
I was putting credit on my phone these days.
There are two options: one survived the contents.
And another allows us to be well.
The offer: the recipes were dismantled, the offers were killed.
Someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want in himself, so I went there and asked to leave.
I picked up to get out of the offer and marked on the recipe.
Uber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was already there marked to take the audience.
This is not asking me to leave if I was really in the people and up to now.
I had a good time to meet someone else, but I talk a lot with the UPR mountain, I don't know if you get to Uber those years, they started.
And then, a truck from Uber once tells me a story.
And a lady?
I put a "p".
When he got to the car, there was another person in the car.
The year looked at this strange and said, "Hey, there's another façades in the car?"
The problem is she chose culto.
(Laughter) She chose him without even knowing, (Laughter) and she chose what was already chosen by her.
Isn't it?
This is very complicated, it's very interesting for us to imagine who are these decisions.
If we go to Google today, do we need a person's comedy?
In 177,000 results.
What are we clicking?
91 percent of people explain the results of the first Google page.
Who's chosen a place where we're going to eat from someone was me even Google?
After that, what I do: I go there and click on the website seven.
I love the page seven, and I see there what has the page not: "I'm on the web page."
So, I want to ask for that.
(Laughter)
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us little emphas.
These young men, in English, have a name in the behavioral economy, also have a name, they are called "innants."
In German, which is exactly a little push in English, I'd like to ask you to put a little push and started both by your side.
You don't need a picture to see ... (Laughter) It's an ecology.
(Laughter) He's an excellent.
Is there a theory?
It was an autocony called "Britatera," he has a book called "Donantes."
And ...
The concept of "digitalizing" is what I gave.
It was a simple way of understanding these pushments in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, at the end of the talk came to me and said,
Now I understood.
Think about what is the fight.
(Laughter) But it's not true.
(Laughter) In this talk, it was my photo, my object cord, (Laughter) and "Wow."
You're thinking that only one who's falling on this is European, Austria and Detina Marca.
Everyone here has received an email.
TEDx confirmation.
In the middle, I had a text.
Secondly, when you apply in a person's TEDx, you're automatically receiving the power of all your decisions.
And you'll eat in your life.
The winspics: me.
(Laughter) Thank you.
If you don't want to be easy to stay on this limit?
And I asked you to leave this.
How many people criticized the book?
More than 400 inscribed people.
(Laughter) So, this means that I build all the decisions of the life of 13 people who stayed in the relationship.
No, that was just an experiment.
According to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave.
And I show you the results.
Generally, what do people ask me?
To have this knowledge of these little pushers?
There are many of them there.
What did he do?
You can do it because we manipulate someone.
And my answer is yes.
The enemy and said yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
