I want to start with Nelson Mandela, in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our life for them, and, however, our children come from maltratted to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
What if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, who are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence, and if they rebel.
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't go well either: we make don't crimes more sincere, I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll take it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Starting with her pregnancy, it's about having to understand.
These teachers: Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
She then starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces C-section culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is harmful, dangerous, painful, that generates a red statistic, 93% are made by C-section.
According to 15 to 20% in the engaged countries, this generates enormous benefits for children. This makes us lose this moment of love and replace a surgical act of a woman, a woman is hurt, imobilized, of course, she can be humanized and can be done well, but certainly won't have the same benefits that in a normal part, remembering that, of course, there are necessary cesaries for each one of these sines we'll be.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, it's going to be true, here, you can take that a mammal is a tiny milk formula, in the case of her need, she's hungry, she goes home safer, and she reaches her grandma's house, and she loses the wonders that her breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise.
For the consumer, but it adds the advertisement in itself by the names it gives to the forms, they premiere.
Have you experienced it?
Swiss!
The maternal milk is money, it's entered, it's breastfeeding.
But he, precisely, comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industries make the advertisement directly to the doctor, making a doctor their partner, convinced of their nutritional and congressive qualities, and sponsoring the medical societies integrally, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatric, that end up consciously being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil.
And this way we're losing.
Social privileges are not an immigration.
By trying, through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
My Gabriela grows, her mother will end a license, she will have to go to the crew because she can't take care of vovement.
And she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, but to get home, her parents are tired of tired, in a long time of work, in bottles, and they'll live with her daughter, there's still work to do at home, in the weekends.
And they'll take BAP in post-terrabá, because, after all, no one is iron, and what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood, so for our children.
We regret ourselves so much with the childhood dream of this, and the child loses his contact with the most important people in their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of this terrible peculiar of childhood's personalization.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food in fat, saturated fat, what the media tells us to give frozen food, industrialized food.
Unnormous accesss of salt and sugar, crocking abroad, all the weapons that the industry, through food engineering, highly developed, makes children completely addicted to healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
And ...
This brings serious problems with diabetic obesity that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, that it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we're world consumption champions of agrotoxes, this is the inxication of childhood that also leads serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a creation called "chequeerma," which has hair for four months, and somebody knows that, highly negative, the involved of a child, she has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
However, our urban lives don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they get home, to stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, they can't, they enlighten me, and don't want if everyone is involved, so these children spend eight to ten hours connected to their devices today.
Again, connecting with the white wall, it's great, but not eight hours later, the kids don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this one time it's getting worse, I remember when I used to travel the car with my children, we played, it was an incredible moment, and the family of laughing humour, of things that fall in the memory of us can't give something in the car.
Even in moments, this exists, people, even in moments when the child most needs - this exists, it's from there, but it doesn't spread, "Ipórnico," "Ipóte," and there's still a layer to cover the tablet so I don't look at the laptop, right?
Even in the moments she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this makes us confined our children, and preventing them to have moments of awareness, with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
It's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it passes at maximum four hours, and it spend more time on American TV, and in our work, sometimes, because we have less time at school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to Park, and she doesn't go to Park. The family does the classical show of the Brazilian family today in week, "O".
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, for consumer values, and this advertising is a wild obesity.
The mobility that explodes its capacity to distinguish, to fantasy reality fantasy, that explore her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, inclusion of this love, and that instills values like an obsessive consumption.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
In obesity, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drink, not even people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, it's obviously the one who most needs friendship are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by child consumerism.
Cabrela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of commitments.
To relax this stress, they add another class, which is a meditation class, but it could meditate in the little square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: those who didn't meditate in the balance looks at the sky, look at the ground.
Look at being, there is no better meditation than that.
Hongoladeiro, with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: merudization.
That uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, meradization, which is based on sexism, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the Association of Sexuality.
Love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we have eight, ten years old, this sin of adopting the ending of childhood and of precocious erotization.
There's peace that's afraid of her, because it doesn't live with her, so instead of giving our children the experience, we're losing this ability, instead of this, we're doing what the Americans call "hélicopterprinting," we interrupt between children's experience and the world.
They don't have a life experience, so they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, that surely the world will give them a childhood.
Well, faced with so many problems, of course, childhood will give symptoms: the child will be rebelled, bright, split, and then eat too much, they'll be obese, they'll be bad at school, they're not paying attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way that we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What's the year?
The solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give medicines, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in fact.
What Factory is producing is exactly the medicine, and that's what we're doing with our children, not only with the alien children, the adults also in a very agony way.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for one of the depressives, that we'll arrive at this point, and Ritalina, such as medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and activity, sold in 1999, 70 thousand boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes, and we're rooting, "normatizing," and preventing children from being themselves.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths, and problems are very complex, I don't see, without end of sines and factors that feed each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as a philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simply, easy and invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I want us to reflect on this, a well-known TEDx solution, I'm surely going through it, but it's OK, I'm a little, a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And in relation to time, what we can do, when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, and penitence today means "attack off," in almost all churches, the décimo is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, our children, which is our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Our capital.
More importantly, it's time.
The time?
We have 17 hours of surveillance.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This gives an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, just priorize, close your eyes in 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow, because they have health, quality of life, not a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
Give me if you fit in this statement.
Isn't it?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows the importance of nature, in nature, is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human health, deeply associated with human soul; we know what makes us healthy; it's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, these factors. We know this, what we don't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
Everything that causes health does the environment well, and vice versa: riding a bike, does the body well, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transport for a long time, reduces the three, the pollution, with nature, probably said with an open space, which he says, "Look how wonderful!
He will cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness especially for children, who will know each other and learn how to deal with them, to develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physical, being psychic, mental, and it will reduce all childhood problems, we're not talking about skipping the wall.
For the city, embracing the cities and playing in the parks, occupying public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, with guest.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and also not only the initiative of physical users, that facilitate contact with public space and nature, that promote ciclovies, free events of these places, baking bathrooms, gardens in the city, public transport, to take us these places, safety, civil policy, reinviting public policies.
The governance of these cities is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as happened in São Paulo, where you can see here, in a photo of the Billings Represa, a source of water from São Paulo for 30 or 40 years, and today it means that, to have public spaces with joy, and, mainly, participate in the governance of the cities.
through mago-vernance and cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand public agendas based on public interest, sustainability, and equity.
With transparency and accounts, there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this: to finish the same scientists who announce a terrible crisis, reducing the inequality from the social point of view, and from the environmental point of view, of course, doing everything we already know.
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking kids outside, families, already outside, let's make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold footprint, not seeing YouTube, and we learn more about this box, and we'll defend in the future, because we only defend what we're doing, so, in short, this is our proposal.
Well, I don't know if you want to know what I've learned over ten years with disabled people, I've learned to see the possibilities that, in another school, coexisting with people who don't hear, who, in another school, are able to do well, that in another school, coexisting with people who are very marked by parents, with disabilities, and with what they have what I'm the best friend of them, and with their parents, for example, they have what they can't arrive, to have friends, to have friends, and to be very thankful to them.
(Laughter) Good night, I always liked eating, but I never went to cook.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
cooking, working in the kitchen, she who took account of Christmas seeds, new year, Paáscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking: in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my world view, changed my diet, because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young people, and then I decided to study a little about Iurveda and macrobiology, which is care and respect for nature.
(Laughter) So I decided we could.
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life.
Trossé is a little of life.
It's natural to the city, we can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way we can connect with nature.
I said, "Oh, that's it.
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood we could use it.
Food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
Yes, to do it.
Following the food system, changing the food dynamics, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on industrial scale, it's quantity and speed.
The biggest is the cost for the environment and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle.
It's there.
It begins to grow and produce in a way that their bodies arrive an hour that doesn't hold, and it begins to lose, decrease drastically their quality of life, their health and their time of life.
And then?
I believe that we ...
This is very complex because, as it may cost so little, you can create an animal and you must change this food system. I was passing the other day in a supermarket and I realized that Franco's quilo was cheaper than tomato's quilo, I said, "Look how you can, and this is very complex.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process on the industrial scale is also a long year.
Let's say this harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, nowadays, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agro toxic farms in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
I wanted to understand why, but the answer is because our current society.
There are inverted values, there's an alertical investment, because it doesn't know that the procedure doesn't know which chemistry there is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal.
Right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, a pack of organic leface, you're paying, not only you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go, instead of one on social media, many times they don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of, with all love and affection, and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
(Applause)
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think...
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
And in terms of consumption?
Also...
It's the way we consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in São Paulo.
And if I take her in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure she's going to be very scared, seeing those executives or those depressed people walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swimming a pizza piece, for example, because it's also very important, so she'd finally go.
To have almost a fivethpaste, but because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing yourself, of feeding yourself.
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the streets, which is really cool.
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little bricks, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of waste of sugar, which are the three, industrialized products, overcome, is very harmful, and they end up creating a physical dependence, but also mental dependency, a physiological dependency, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorn in the place of microwonds, look?
This question - (Laughter) This might seem these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange bread's popcorn for the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health because you're half.
It's consuming chemicals that you wouldn't wear, I'm sure of absolute certainty, in your panick, and you're also polluting with the packaging of microwonds, of a packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think consumption.
It's excessive of industrialized products, it's really pre-gudicial.
So, let's talk ...
To summarize this question of the food production process, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not easy, it's not working, and we have to change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
(Applause)
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health, cooking brings safety, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
And I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you ...
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Lazanha, frozen, frozen battle, hamburger, blind dog...
What about a pizza?
(Applause)
And there's the discipizza, because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, so I believe we...
Oh, no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean, where is the beijão rhythm of each day that filled our belly and our soul?
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, who think that making food is very worky, it's very anti-pathetic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean from night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a fresh street in 20, 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
Spering or delivering of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
Menine, girl.
Children, adult and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, by changing education, we teach children, taking their children to fair, to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner, putting children in order to get married, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can...
It's to build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic vision of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think they come from the supermarket shelves, so the kids go.
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutical industry, because they'll be much less sick, growing with fear of a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change.
Addynamics.
In food, we have to change our wi.
The value for our value.
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention.
So?
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose foods?
These are choices we can make to change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
Life is not the one we've lived, but it's the one we wake up and wake up to tell.
Being here has gone deep to talk about the power of transforming stories is to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world, he got married with my father, and after having had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father.
We are our story before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early, I always liked writing, reading, storytelling, this book helped me live the mourning and, at school, I even wrote a book called "decondly" that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously somebody ...
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood at 45 years that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had already been very small to me, will come and sit on the lap of this story and feel welcomed.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so uncomfortable for us, because that's what he's always suffered and he wanted to share the story with others, except that I hold you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always complaining about who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can accept themselves, that they can take who they are, as we said here, without fear.
And he, who was understanding this, was changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
I really like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also to have seen that the roots they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat, and they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story.
A lot of people.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story and hadn't taken this to people in a way that didn't have any shame.
So, tell stories to me ...
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
So many, not only in them, but in my too, from everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear, we transform ourselves in this place, show their children's picture, but, for me, there's no formula, there's a big rule.
About this, I told the story of the egg, the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, he researches listening, and there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before everything.
From his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "That's all here, it's all here, and shows me your head, how much the truth has to get out of here."
It has to be my heart, and it has changed everything.
And there came the day, he gave an incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how it was the fact that he had been heard, when he needed it, when he thought about it, and he was suicide when he had cancer, that made him ...
I went to study about this, and it was him who taught me that we are always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, there are so many courses of equission, oratory, writing, but who is worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves, we're afraid to change, although the most dictated word here is that we'll change.
There's always this fear, and, like this fear, we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And to the others, and to listen?
You see, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have one minute to look at each other, to come hug and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) But after hearing his talk, another TEDx returned.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most diverse things I heard, out of all the others.
(Laughter) That empathy too, I learned from school when she taught me that...
We need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have yes.
We have at least a smile and it doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do art, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you really like to do this?"
Liberating your story, that, despite your lives, and for everyone, came from a poem I wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know, to give them faith in life, faith, in some humans, I'd like to free many people I know, the right to change the right to change, the right to love the straight of bittering, of not bittering, of not bittering, among the important beings, it's not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Thank you.
(Sigh) The truth is, on Earth, being told to me, that I don't belong to many spaces, and stars don't have labels or classifications, they are only belonging to their plurial spaces, there isn't this fat or dark, ugly, rich and poor, but they're only legacted to the existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed about my life.
I don't look for acceptance, but, in respect, from the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
So, why are we so small, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, that is acceptance, empathy, to definitely understand that the different one agrees?
Audience: Yes.
It would be a very bad experience, if we lived in a society where we were all equal, so that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different, the different one is beauty, and this wants rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God, why I was different, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball.
Well, the bathroom turned into a better friend, he was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I wanted her to put the towel in my head and dance rebels, because I only received rebeldes, but the question is, "What was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and if it was denied to me?"
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad, or better, why I needed to be in the bathroom to have this freedom, and why, for lack of information, it's that I'm different.
And, when it comes to the trans universe, this path is harder, I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me, I didn't even know what trans people were, the theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my real adolescence and I started to get rid of, for example, when you lack a lot of empathy in this world, in case of us, get trans, for example, difficult, when you're in middle, to a mixture of transformations, and you still have to learn to deal with the not acceptance of others, it's as if you were in a cash, stay a time there and leave a beautiful eraser.
So they ask, "But come here, do you look after yourself, our new thing, there's no traffic faces, no, you're fased, people, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?"
Is there any gourm here who wants to see this extinct?
As a white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
AC: For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that today women in Brazil have 14 times the chance of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 people who were killed here in Brazil, 2016, performances with 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
And being trans isn't an option, but, in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's no one - I take a little button and a little force, resistance, expectancy of 35 years, there's no one who was still like this, that we could measure this panel better, but it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, for each one of us, the protagonist of your own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
This depends on us, for example, I'm the living proof of it, after I finally found myself who I was, after I finally discovered my essence.
My art, as a form of deconstruction of ideas, to be established about me, I was invited to live a trans character, I was wearing a model, magazine layer, J, and "performing" and Thuber, and in "APs has the career," in an immensor where this novel exposed to more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(End of music) It's a responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
It's as much as in all the subjects that came up on me on the internet, they said, "And as much as, in all the subjects that came out on me on the internet, they talked about, that were cared for comments as a man who is capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, which has no price."
There's no price to receive message from mothers from other girls who thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
I'm a small part of what I am, I'm much beyond that, I'm much beyond trans, but to understand this, I'm a post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky?
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was me, an alarm person.
Inmensity, freedom without limits, me and sky.
Your and me.
Not looking anymore, I don't need to stop, I've already gotten away from my courant, from the past, only what left their scars, that mark my soul.
Well, the future.
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I've never been able to explain to children what cancer was, what is in treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian section, that doctors called "teratoma," one of them said, "Geee, we open our heads, open our belly to take down tumors, it won't take a seventure." Well, it had been called with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do a surgery there.
(Laughter) I got down, it was full of tubes and connections, the belly covered, I called nurse, and asked, "Can, she said it?"
I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "There's no visitor's time," and I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
I cut only after the bedroom, I was with cancer, metáses, and committed gangs, I said to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, not when you're lucky, so ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital websites, and the only thing that happened to me ...
That was the safe information at that moment, that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive humour and with a few chances of healing, and then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
And how are you going to engage someone, if many times you can't even say the word "cluster," which sometimes didn't help, that wouldn't engage.
And I was stubborn.
And ...
The piruque bothered me, forgot, harassed, but my friends were donating my hair to help me, and then, at that moment, I realized.
This information from society, for them to have hair, in fact, it wasn't for me.
They opened what it was for them.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with this I went to see many other information I thought wasn't the most suitable.
(Laughter) When I got to the hospital, a doll, the children said, "Wow, you launched your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer, I've got it for you.
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I went to put the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, the first one had a job, I got a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, a sabonete came, a toothpaste and a toothpaste of teeth, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
I had no hair, (Laughter) And that for my information, and I started photographing all the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent kids to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
Things we were playing, but we think that children don't understand that they don't know, they know the name of chemotherapy, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try to not talk to protect them, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, what they'll find.
But the patient approached the end, it's focused on the patient, it's in the middle, but at the end of the process, and when we explained all this with the support of health professionals, advertising professionals, but you say that the information is focused on the patient, and with what we couldn't understand that doctors would talk fast, as well as the tumor cells doubly with the heart, you have ventric drawings.
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is distributed to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year, if we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and what is required in Northwest, because children and parents are often alphabets, that children will do.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit, then what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when it's events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
AC: When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wired, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at BABA website, that this doesn't have, and what happens with it, and when you're the patient.
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, weak, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship, and you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and I say, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
(Laughter) OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there was a child with an adult who, in the case, was me, that people would look to spend the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need self-esteem, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
(Laughter) We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important: I went to the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
AC: In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the pair, I just don't stop what I don't want."
And, fortunately, this isn't easy, because the dependency here gives me disease in a brain disease and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we've been thinking of various things: unfortunately drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have a almost free passage free from the emcefalical barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by cells, anticorposs, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
So, maybe we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, a few years ago, we couldn't gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours, it's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barrier in killing meals to help these patients, and me and my team ...
And then, that problem that the emerticephalic barrier had to let drugs go freely, stop giving up, because when the user consumes drugs, a few years ago, we've been searching for a message of hope. In other words, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain a new freedom of her and control her.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these people with chemical dependency, when these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, we believe that, with time, with the vaccine, they will be able to have time to decide, which is, in fact, to bring this much bigger solution in blood than the rats that don't receive cocaine.
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much.
I've been a psychotherapist for more than 40 years.
I want to tell you that beyond generosis, there is a disease of psychosis, beyond terrible psychosis.
It's a nefasta disease, in fact.
That's already in Filenu, Pervai, and I call it "normose," the normality pathology.
And I have to say that the great meeting of this TEDx, our porra, and maybe these units in singing, is that girlfriend is being broken from the beginning.
They are habits, attitudes than norma, which is a nice example, for example, in some sense: war, filled with social consensus, a set of more mortiffer behaviors, maybe the normmacy.
Up to where I can comprehend, there are two fundamentals the most important of the norm, and it's the location: the other is evolution.
The system, the location, in which we live in a context, will not always exist:amorphosis is a typical disease that hasn't always existed nor always.
Dishumanity where violence predominates, lack of listening, lack of care, lack of responsibility, in its words, egocentrism.
So, being normal is adapting to a sick system and keeping Unipás, which does the absence of conflicts. I've been in an operator for more than 30,000 years from the International University of Paz.
"It's a good fight!"
But, as the place of peace, such as the queue, Chinese wisdom, is angnancy, but, with other areas, how many wars, Perei, who will be a little paid, to bury for peace.
So, in the same way, health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes, healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even a fair indignation, a conscious despair, lucid.
This reminds me of a family couple Isabela, who has a 8-year-old boy, and the mother asked me, "What is the princess you like most, the baker sheet dies and answered, "I like all the May kilos, and today she's 34.
People who looked for me too, who captured the panic disease, for example, all the people who looked for me is a fear of animals, pain, contradictions, because it has the sensibility to feel in my own skin, I respect a lot of people who calm down.
And I respect a lot.
People considered crazy, and, as I've said, is why in Africa, many people are considered as psychoactics and neotics, and sometimes don't fail.
The problem is that the saint knows, maybe, in those people, at least, have a disability to have consensus pain, an insomy, the difference between a seed in a mad person, and it doesn't talk, that we call psychiatric, be santos failed.
It's a dehumanity.
He's target of bullying, a psychotherapist, and said to me, "Doctor, I have a problem at home, and he's not Singa, he's good, he raises up to a older person sitting down to what I want to say, you understand when I was Porto Alegre."
So, I must say that all people who respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, as ...
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
(Applause) That nothing against certainty?
So, in this moment, we have to suffer from unpleasantness.
None, another specialization, a person who knows almost everything inexorable, a person with exclusions, in an inexorable globalization, a person who is extremely specialist, is incompetent.
But it's not about making the appology of the generalist, but it's not the functions of computers.
We don't see here a possibility of solution I have called vocation, maybe, in this education that has also been pointing here, is what we're honoring a promise we've done.
And only you can tell it, if you didn't count, it will lose.
So, a foundation of norms has also been said, it's an evolutionary today, and there's another very important.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves: What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us from a bird, a snake, a monkey?
One day, talking to his father, he told us that it's absolutely naive, I like to remember the Relentur, Mr. Freud Max, xileno, Crador da Deudança, a great brother, the Audence, a science that needs to study, it differentiates, for example, the empty, intelligence, it's not culture, no. His father says that he became the first studio, it won't be stupid, it won't be stupid, it won't be stupid, it won't be stupid, it won't be stupid.
And do it as a person who is talking about developing, with graphs, sophisticated tobels, like a person sitting on the branch of a tree.
"Nice," he also said.
And he agreed: Einstein, two infinite things, there was only the universe in this human tupidity, that for him, I still have my doubts.
But I need to say that I agree, I'd rather think of a confuse: we are born to be, to flourish, we make ourselves humans, that what differentiates our species, yes, of the standard of other species, is the inacabase, that, at 26,00 years, said, to us, so, respecting us, it's not from nature, Max Nepy, away.
Emotional Intelligence, that, since the 17th century, has developed emotional intelligence, school for tartarugas, or for education, is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, without listening to the talk about cultivating the dimensions of the psychiatrist's soul.
I knew what the precets of the sky were, at 30, I suggested my feet, filmented on the floor, because what I wanted, not that day anymore, the borders of the sky, at 50 years old, but we also need to develop awareness, to develop a literacy, in that sense, its long existence.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: Is it the 21st century for the human being? These are people who haven't invested in the most properly human potential? That's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being?
Nothing less than this finds this game of new ones, the future of generations.
So, the norm is terrible because it's insidious for silencing, people don't realize it.
It's not easy, because you become a human being, David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution of human beings, but the human being, where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to or to serve.
Someone asked for the IP, Paline de God, and the IT flowed.
Maybe there's only one way to talk about the mystery in the big life, it's flowing.
that we are potentially.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire, "You think that with these ridicules you'll turn off, so I'm doing a little square forest, thatimads, and all the bugs would escape, and I'd return with patience, no, from aflated.
And if we don't do this in this little corner of the world that the great world confies to each one of us, we're all very tired, we're all very tired, we can do our part: in fact, it doesn't have flags, it's not occupying anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, I don't have a book, the conspiration, the conspiration, the coriana of Marlido and Féx.
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle and everyone, at some point, will be here, in what you are on this stage, but on the stage, telling your story, instead of just complaining about darkness.
It's also time to not think, so I want to conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our transbord race, it's time of renewing, my love poets.
I believe that we read love with bread and poetry will still save the world.
Multiplique your eyes to see more, always the other, always far, renounce yourself to forget about the collection, but always of all, I destroyed the eyes they had seen you, always far away, renewed you, for other visions, but always of everything, thank you very much.
AV: Let's go to a good school.
Decória.
I take notes, choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child.
(Video) I choose a resignation university, public preference, every time a lawyer, an advertising, or a marker, since a mother has a income.
Do interactive meetings of eyees that won't take the child from anywhere, be trained, receive a greet, work in 12 hours per diphic, lighten up to the limit of their forces, shows that you're important for the structure, more than working, it's important to appear and it's always producing.
(Laughter) A marked hour, smooths, exchange for employment, firm car, or manager, finds someone, nurturing, nurturing, wedding, who checks the freak at an hour, viewing the shirt, viewing the shirt.
Luke, if the first apartment has a son, after two years, his second son is to listen to himself.
(Laughter) Try the car, yes, year, no ... (Laughter) Disney, two years later, everything and seven days per Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami, bought an apartment in Sweden and 180 convictions, completely unqualified people, being promoted before you, who start and fall asleep as their desires.
(Laughter) A continuous feeling of mutation, the void that passes in the mall at the weekends, can't be applause, drink socially every day, the shock on an antenna of pleasure that goes so soon the marriage lake is broken, slipped.
(Laughter) The middle-truth crisis, the meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years going fast, is short life.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society, the first place.
The cholesterol is a little high, his body flattered, like an astronaut who spent years fighting zero gravity, the vice-president who, despite all the efforts, never arrived, will probably never arrive, gluten-fi, lactose of beejada, we'll sell the beach's apartment, the children grew up and don't want to look more at the shirt, the continuous fear of losing the job, today doesn't value the experience anymore.
The fear of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
The complete disconnection with your children decorated from the 12 hours of work field for decades: empty retirement, surrounded by useless and unjust things; you're a winner, this unique consolo.
Thank you, your life as an executive executive, shirt-shirt, wood, for the real time.
