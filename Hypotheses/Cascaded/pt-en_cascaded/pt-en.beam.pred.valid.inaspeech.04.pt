I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our lives for them, and we don't understand.
Our children are getting very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
What if they rebel?
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
And we'll get it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Starting with her pregnancy to have understood.
These seas.
The mother of Gabriela.
Do you want it?
He has a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
She then starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces blinding culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is harmful, dangerous, painful.
It generates a shameful statistic in our country.
Ninety and 3 percent of births in the private network, for example, in Rio de Janeiro, 93 percent.
They are made by C-section.
It includes 15 to 20% of developed parents.
This generates huge benefits for children, that makes us lose this moment of love.
He host a medical surgeon, with an adopted woman.
Inmobilized, of course, it can be humanized, and it can be done, but certainly it won't have the same benefits as normal birth, remembering that, of course, there are necessary meetings for each of these sines that we'll list.
We are criticizing is exaggeration, unnecessary, what is lying.
The same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I left maternity.
One of the many pediatrists that can be there.
Working, it's going to tell reality: you can take only a bottle, a small milk formula in milk in the case of her, precise, and even hunger.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother goes home and says, "You've grown up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, strong?"
The child is crying, so he's weak, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise.
For the consumer, but it adds the advertisement in itself by the names it gives to the forms, they premiere.
Have you experienced it?
It's close.
In maternal milk, flight is breastfeeding.
But he came with a lot of love.
He's, unfortunately, superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, they do their marriage doctor.
Knowing about their nutritional qualities, making baby's development.
And that sponsoring with a bunch of prizes and dinneries and congresses and sponsoring integrally the medical societies conquering the pediatric sympaty that end up being one of the biggest causes of basic básico.
And this way we're losing.
Social privileges are not an immigration.
By teaching, through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth of the breastfeeding.
Thanks to health problems in children, mothers, and that even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
My Gabriela grows, her mother will end a license, she will have to go to a crew because she can't take care of vovement.
And it will spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution.
But arriving home, these parents are tired of tirednesses, of long-to-day journeys, of helplessness, and they will live little with their daughter.
There's still work to do at home, right?
At the weekend, they're going to pass.
And they'll take babies, imposed, erase babies, because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood, obviously.
Our children.
We regret ourselves so much, we get my adolescence from this.
And the child loses his contact with the most important people in his life.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone.
To be at home with this person.
These are our precious children, and we are losing this because of external and sincere, of the third-thirization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, don't have time, don't have money to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give frozen food, industrialized food, what supermarkets expose to brilliant shelves.
They end up exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy.
Because of a rich food.
In fat, saturated fat.
Namous excess of salt and sugar.
Black people out there, lines inside, all the weapons that the industry, through highly developed food engineering.
Do it.
so that children can be completely addicted to industrialized food and in this way unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
"And ...?"
This brings serious problems with diabetic obesity that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, that it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we're worldwide consumption champions.
The intoxication of childhood also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has cables for four months, and somebody knows that highly negative and engaging with a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
However, our urban life doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they enlighten me, and don't want everyone to go back.
These children spend eight.
Guys, this is statistic.
Eight to 10 hours connected to your devices today.
Again, connecting with the play device is great, but not eight hours later.
Children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're constantly distracted, and this is getting worse, I remember that when I traveled the car, my children, we played, it was an incredible moment.
From the car, a child, it's a wonderful thing: we played "Dedanha," who played "Dedanha," here, the country chose letter B, right?
We used to play team games, moments of family relief, laughing, and things that stay in our memory of us in childhood.
We looked at the window, we saw a landscape passing, in the form of meditation, but today it's two duties and two states for each one, if it can't do anything in the car.
Even in moments, that exists, guys.
Even in moments when the child most needs that exists, this comes from there, but you can say, "Ipórico," "Ipote."
(Laughter) That's the name, go for it.
It still comes with a layer to cover the tablet associated with a chicken look, right?
Even in the moments she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this makes us confin our children, and prevent them from having moments of awareness, of void.
TEDx?
TEDx is fundamental in childhood because TED and void are berce of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination.
And we're breastfeeding this from our children.
With this sin, confinement and permanent distraction.
Bela watched four hours on TV per day.
It's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it spend at maximum four hours, and it spend more time on American TV, and in our work, sometimes, because we have less time at school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the stool, the family does the classical show of the Brazilian family, where it comes week, which is the ...
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, for consumer values, and this advertising is a wild obesity.
The mobility that explodes its capacity, to distinguish and fantasy reality, that explore her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, inclusion of this love.
And that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
utility in worse things.
And what will it be like?
In obesity, even in glass consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, not people, advertisement is totally liberated and always confused from friendship behind.
Obviously, the ones who need friendship most are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by beer's commercial, and welcoming, adolescence, is growing scary, this peculiar of the mercantivization of childhood and child consumptionism.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, the wonderful thing: Who has never meditated in balance?
Look at the sky.
Look at the floor.
Look at the being.
There's no better meditation than that!
"Let's spend money with another class," and then it won't be exposed to that.
The type of erotization is that our society proposes, "Merodization."
And he uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products.
An organization that is based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worst, in the dissociation of sexuality.
Love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erodization, and this affects children directly deforming their mind when we have eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and early erotization.
Gabriela.
There's peace that fears her, because they don't live with her.
So, instead of limiting them, they put them in a tribe.
It becomes the family queen and not a member of the family, it starts to decide the programs, the cardboard, if it's going bad at school, the school's fault, we have to go talk to a teacher.
She'd gain many gifts, when she needed, it would be presence.
She realizes that she is more and more that her parents have no authority, a child.
Sometimes, when I was two or three years old, they realize that parents don't have the authority, it gets a little crazy.
She feels insecure, she needs people who lead her life.
This generates anxiety and generates symptoms.
We know that the importance of limits aren't fundamental forms of love, we need to give to our children, and we're losing this capacity, instead of that, we're doing what the Americans call "Antarctic Expy," we interrupt between the experience of children and the world.
By doing that they don't have life experience, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to wake up with frustration, with pain, with difficulty, and the world will certainly give them later, this is the sin.
from the intronization and the superpower of childhood.
Faced with so many problems, of course, childhood will give symptoms: the child will be rebelled, quarrels, sneakers, and will get sick, eat too much, become obese, goes bad at school, don't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about it.
It's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
"What is the soul?"
The solution we're not going to give to evilted children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late the black person to behave well, it's called "medicalization and it's the worst of the fish."
Well, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in fact.
What the factory is producing exactly the medicine.
This is what we are doing for our children, not only with alienate children, adults also in a shameful way, medicalization of the most deleted phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are so much assembly they appreciate with this individualistic society.
The three employees are the market that grows the most for depressants.
We're arriving at this point.
And Ritalina, such as medicine, which is for the disorder of attention and hyperactivity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't a disease epidemic, this is a massacre against childhood, we're rooting, "normatizing," and I'm sure some of these genius, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, we'd have lost that wonderfully the trouxé grains.
So we can see that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but better: to change the paths.
And problems are very complex, I don't see at the end of sines and factors that self-realiment each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity.
As the philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simple, easy.
And invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I think we think we think about this: a good solution, a TEDx style, I'm surely spending my time, but it's OK, I'm a little bit, a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time.
And space, but nothing.
In relation to time?
What can we do?
When we talk about sins, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today.
It means "attachment dismo," in almost all churches.
The décima is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, which are our sacred ones.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Our capital.
The most important thing is the theme.
The time?
We have 17 hours of age.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing.
And if it doesn't happen every week, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children in relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds.
Let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds.
I imagine a healthy place.
A healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, is a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life.
It was a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
Look at your eyes.
Give me if you fit in this statement.
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows little importance of nature in nature is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with human soul.
We know what makes us healthy, not a doctor, hospital, medicine, all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and it had an interesting experience, I started here with the pattern that back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!
I talked about convergence and health of sustainability: I didn't know that everything I do good to me.
It's being good for nature to the environment.
All health does well the environment and vice versa good.
To ride bike, to use a body, with my cities, reduce bottles, pollution, collective transport for a long time to convince, reduce stress, reduce pollution.
My organicist who was a body event, does good for the rivers, does good for the earth, sees the animals.
Things always go into slow in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce consumption of excessive material, he'll promote the game book, which, at the same time, will generate intelligence, humour, imagination, creativity, and he'll generate different children who will meet.
And learning to deal with them, we'll develop empathy, we'll promote contact with air, only and green that produces physical well-being, mental well-being, and it will reduce all childhood problems, it's the studies that show that it reduces obesity, aggressiveness, inclusion Law, improves immunity, improves socialization and schooling, in a wonderful way.
And when I talk about bringing children into nature, we're not talking.
spaces when we dominate with steps shrink, and now we'll have a bad space, no, we're talking about domination.
We're talking about jumping the wall.
And for the city, to embrace the cities.
and play in the squares, occupy public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, with guest.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and also not only the initiative to use civil physics, re-indicating why they facilitate us with public space with nature, that promote bikes.
free inventions of these spaces, neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Unforgettable and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocupaque," practically used for citizen resistance today, it means to occupy public spaces with joy.
And ...
Mainly participate in the city governance, the city governance is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as happened in São Paulo.
But you can see here a photo of the Billings Represa, a source of water from São Paulo, 30 to 40 years ago, and today.
By the mago-vernance?
And cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation.
Are they returned and people demand?
Imagine the public policies voted to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
With transparency to complain, there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre.
It's cool for us to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, which is coming here, will come very early, our children will get me in, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, that there are two ways to mitigate this crisis.
Reducing inequality from the social point of view, it puts environmental view, of course, doing everything we already know, right?
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking children outside, bringing children to the square, now.
Let's bring children to nature, let's make them love nature, because only by experimenting.
The cold Kachoeira doesn't sell YouTube, it's that we learn to love that little spark and defend in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children already outside, families already outside.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces, with play, with entertainment, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing the gallery side phase that left us ...
Unfortunately, that year, he said that utopia is on the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so what does utopia serve?
Exactly to not make us walk.
It makes us walk abroad, thank you.
In 2007.
I came across a great group of young people and adults with disabilities.
Explusted from regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
It was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project called "Café terapêutico."
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a truly inclusive society?
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion within school.
With their parents, with their children and partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities -
Sometimes they're left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
To be loved, to interact with people.
They tell the case of the student Igor, for example, that in the other school he studied.
For four years he didn't get into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
People didn't have the strength for this either, so, for four years, he stayed in the court.
Participating in all physical education lessons.
As he loved running, he ran all the time.
AC: When I got to the Seja Campulimpo, I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school.
And what together could we do?
So that he could ...
They achieved better learning.
The school?
A paradise was a place of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
Today, he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
And I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And they can teach students to enjoy their own learning process.
The schools think.
That they are not able to assist these students and that they are prepared to receive us.
(Laughter) But schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use and believe that they are capable and that these opportunities are inside the school.
Let's do good for them, and do good for other students, for the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
Why did I look like this?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know and what we can learn together.
AC: Do you want to know what I learned over ten years working with disabled people?
(Laughter) I learned to appreciate my look.
They survive with people so they can see it.
I learned to use my hearing.
surviving with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
(Laughter) I learned to value my ideas, with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
The most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students: to create connections and bonds of friendship, and the most important thing for society?
It's learning the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
AC: Good evening.
I always liked eating.
But I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
To cook, right?
Cozinhar, working in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Páscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world.
It changed my diet and, with it, I started to realize that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
Food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a medicine month.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiology."
These philosophy has rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system through food.
And ...
I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization.
It's the detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's people.
It was too expensive.
It's a little ...
From life.
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can.
It's to connect with nature.
And ...
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside.
And there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
It's food, food.
As a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health.
But also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's to do it.
Restrutural the food system.
Changing the dynamics.
It gives food.
The production process.
Distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example.
of meat production process, for example.
There are two principles that lead.
The meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more ...
Do you produce it?
The cheaper.
It's produced.
Worst is quality.
And ...
Memor is the cost of the environment and our health in terms of speed.
The animal's cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, is artificially accelerated.
ELI.
He lost, he started to grow and produce in a way that his bodies...
I arrive an hour that is not delayed.
And he begins to lose, decrease drastically.
Your quality of life.
Your health and your life time.
So?
I believe that we ...
It can and must change this system.
Of course...
This food system was passing the other day in the supermarket.
He noticed it.
That Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can it be, this is very complex because how can it cost so little?"
You can create an animal from birth to abate.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables.
The production process on the industrial scale is also very...
We say it so harmful for our lives, for our health, and for the environment, why?
Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but even so.
They keep polarizing.
This abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer ...
Is it because our current society?
There are inverted values, there is an investment of values, why does a person worry?
If you don't buy a failed perfume, because you think you'll go.
There's an allergic reaction because it doesn't know the procedure, it doesn't know which type of chemistry is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal.
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, the more you buy, for example, a pill of leface.
It's a bit of organic interface, you're paying not only you're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go: investing on social media, many times, they don't know that behind that leface, someone took care of all the love and affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution?
It's also not efficient.
I think...
You must know that we produce lots of food.
One third of the food we produce -
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason.
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption.
Also.
It's the way we...
Today's consuming food is scary, my grandmother is Pulista, she lives in São Paulo.
If I took her, put it on.
In the middle of Paulista Avenue.
I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Seeing those executives, or those depressed people walking down the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because it's something that people, many people think it's a waste of time, but actually.
It's very important, so she'd go to the end.
It's almost a simple one.
But because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the streets, which is very...
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of "outdoreaçúcar" which are the three altrugicious, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, and they end up creating a dependence not only physically, but also a mental dependence, a psychological dependency.
a physiological dependency.
That is, industrialized products in excess are very harmful.
I don't even call them food, for me they are food-up comeds, because you can even consume, satisfy, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
Audience: Yes.
And who here still makes panick?
That little panel in the place of microwaves:
Half half... (Laughter) Who here is still a cake instead of buying that little bag with a little package?
Hi, too, half a half ... (Laughter) This is the question.
It may seem a bit harmless, not to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the panick from the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you're going ...
It's consuming.
Chemics that you wouldn't put, I'm absolute certainty.
She was born with panel popcorn.
And you're also polluting with the packaging from microwaves, from a packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think consumption changes.
It's excessive of industrialized products, it's very pre-gudicial.
One month.
So, it's ...
for us to speak.
"Yes ...
To summarize this question of the process ...
I think it's food production.
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not a wise idea.
Very good.
If it's not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Play brings independence, brings high.
self-knowledge brings autonomy.
Bring safety, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you?
That's it.
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Wasanha, frozen?
Bats, hamburgers, dry dog.
What about a pizza?
And it gives them the disquipizza, because even pizza, we know how to do more, so I believe we ...
"Ah! I don't know
"Oh no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean of each day?
That filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think that doing very work, very anti-personatic food, is waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean, from night to day, wake up in the morning.
And I said, "Yes ...
In 20 minutes, you have a bean ready on the pressure panel.
You can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a small fresh street that you do in 28 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have ready meal.
This might be at the same time.
What would you take to wait for pictures to arrive?
Waiting or delivorous.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen.
As we see the act of cooking.
Everybody can.
They have to cook.
Men, women.
A boy, a girl.
Children, adult and elderly.
There's no ...
There's no sex, no sex, no gender.
Everybody can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education.
We teach children, taking their fair to the children, to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner, putting the children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can.
It's to build a better future, these children will grow.
A holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Many people think it's from the supermarket shelter.
So, the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the industry.
Fharmaceutical because they'll stay.
Very less sick.
Knowing, eating cash food, healthy food.
I believe we have to ...
Change.
Addynamics.
We have to change food.
Our ...
Oh, that's it!
Our value.
Fast.
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Education.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, yes.
It's education.
It's education and prevention.
"So? What do you mean?
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose the food well?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
(Video) Life is not here that we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I'd come back as a child.
Fairy goes by, my cousins, my brothers, and also for family parties.
My torment, Mario Güeyce, was the first blind planter.
You're a mechanized company in Brazil."
Here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my old grandmother and had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five siblings.
I arrived in this world.
Transually, it was yesterday, we, at 50 years ago, are the stories we realize that make us be who we are, and by containing them, we transform ourselves.
And who listens?
It also transforms itself.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
We are our story.
Before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Even my passion for stories started very early, I always liked to write.
Let's read and tell?
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to live Luz.
And I know that he helped a lot of people too.
So have I told this and told this story?
For me, it brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
That is the power that people can feel welcomed in each other's story, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously I'm someone.
"Yeah!"
I saw and will sit on the color of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds about products.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
And I went there.
Help people to tell their stories, because the publicity world had been very small for me.
So I started to do this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx.
Overview ...
Interpretentism with purpose, something so uncomfortable nowadays.
But he brought me another challenge.
which was to talk about harassment.
Because that's what he's always suffered.
And he wanted it.
And I left because I had to do with others, share the story with time.
Except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints.
A right about all that had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and, otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can accept who they are, as we've already said here, without fear?
And he understood that, he was changing the tone.
And on the day, Tiago ...
He grew up on stage.
And he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay.
Absolutely.
And he spoke with a lot of property, about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
I like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also to have seen that the roots they imagined that Tiago had nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better and he welcomed himself.
And just as he welcomed, I'll tell his story.
A lot of people.
If he welcomes me in his story, the last week, he sent me.
A big saying.
That many boys have been looking for it even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story.
who wanted to share the problems they had on their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way.
That I had no shame at all.
So, tell stories to me?
That's it, they cause micro-revolutions in our fair.
I'm?
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
Giving a lot of people to be here, right?
In this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Is there something funny?
It shows your children's pictures, but not really.
I think this is not the most important thing.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not by the roof that courage has color of heart.
What about that?
I told the story of the bird: the audio, the teacher of the Economic university of boys besides, he researches listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDx d'Oçador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before everything.
His talk.
I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what has generated with this every time you talk to me?"
You tell me, "This is all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk.
About listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was heard, when he needed the most, when he thought about it, this is a place when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many addiction courses, oratory, and writing.
But who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we'll change.
So we talk about change, but...
There's always this fear.
We were an excitement, we always arrive and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And for others.
And listening.
You see, also, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
But what about us?
There's no one minute.
To look at others, to come hug and say.
Some things.
We don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
"So? What do you mean?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
After hearing his talk, another TEDx returned, but...
MA: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the variousest stories I heard, out of all the others.
When she taught me that empathy too, I learned high school.
Why?
We need to look yes to the problem of homeless people, for example.
Many say we don't have anything to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have 100.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and tell, that make us be who we are.
And by listening, the other really.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do art, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you really like to do this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me?
For everyone, I came from a poem I wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to liberate many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
From the 4th of the flaws, the salts of the ...
From the values of the kitchen of uncertainty, I wanted to free many of the people I know.
I'm going to make them faith in life.
Faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, of being that they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know.
They had at least one minute of restrooms, so they could look at their side and then smile, count and hear again.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Thank you very much.
The truth is that in the earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, it's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and step.
Where there are no judgments, where there are all sorts of stars and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they're only belonging to their plurial spaces, there's no fathold or thin, beautiful.
Remember the poor.
It's only legacy to their existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed about my life.
A phase that was denied to me.
The right to be just one.
From the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her when she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
That's exactly why I wanted this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and Stargian of the sky.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't reproduce something so simple, which is acceptance?
Empathy.
And to definitely understand that the different one agrees.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals, so that's why we have privilege.
And it's the opportunity to be different.
Different to Belo.
It's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this wants rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a dedicated ball.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied to me?
Or better, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different.
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it comes to the trans universe, this path is even more difficult.
I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me.
I didn't even know what transsexual people were, and, during my 21 years old, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitating, and that desire to grow up inside me, I said, "Guys, I want to turn transsexual too."
Yes.
Everyone coming, so she thought and started in the wrong way.
I wanted to mirror myself to the other.
So, during my graduation in Artescenees, I had the opportunity to meet myself, from inside.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my real teenage years, and I started to get rid of it.
It's as if you enter a cock, stay a while there, that's a beautiful bubble.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everyone is there to deal with it.
It's hard when you're in the middle of the mixture of transformations.
And you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others.
There's a lot of empathy in this world, and if you're a woman, black, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily.
In the case of us, weird, for example, people think I'm a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, is it that you're harmful, our new thing? You don't have transsexual faces?"
No, that's it, it's going to happen.
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is it a fight here who wants to live so fast?
While the man exists, he has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
"So? What do you mean?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And, secondly, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016, with 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
Being a transsexual is not an option.
But in a living condition.
There's no magical formula, there's no strength, no strength, resistance, expectation of 35 years, there's no one who mistakes like this, that we can better measure this panel better, but it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, for each one of us, the protagonist of your own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
I'm depending on ourselves, for example, I'm the living proof of it.
After I finally found who I was, after I finally found my essence, I started to use my own ...
Mine ...
My art as a way of deconstructing ideas, preestablished about me.
I wanted to enter YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people, I was wearing a model, magazine layer, J, and "performing" and "outuber," and at the apex of my career, I was invited to live a trans character, in an immensor where this novel exposed to more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's a responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences for so many people.
Representing a flag and being ugly to all that I represent alongside it.
But, I did, abused, I went to my name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And as much as in all the subjects that would talk about me on the internet, they were filled with comments as capable maleman.
Look, you'll never be a dead woman.
What's no price?
What has no price is to receive message from mothers from other trans girls, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
Because you see me there, and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
To understand the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
It's ... but today I also understand that I don't want to be only three transats.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond trans, but to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky?
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was I?
It won't be there.
A lot of blue.
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky.
Your me.
Not looking anymore.
I don't need to stop.
I've already got away from my corridors.
The past is only what left their scars, that mark my soul.
Well, the future.
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being beside me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried, very brilliant.
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I've never been able to explain to children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian score, that doctors called "teratoma."
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly, dark tumors, you won't take a sixth grade," well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been established, at some point.
Nothing.
And it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later at the ICU.
In the same village I stayed with children with cancer.
Then I looked down, full of tubes and connections.
And ...
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's no visiting time."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
Even for me to sleep.
I cried only later in the room, I needed cancer, measures and committed gangs.
I'd say to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all,
It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky, right?
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital websites.
It's the only thing that ...
That was the safe information at that moment is that I would die.
Because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
That sometimes I didn't help, that I wouldn't engage.
And how is this going to engage someone if many times you can't even say a word?
That's it.
And I was stubborn.
And ...
Opening what bothered me, forgotten, cold, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
(Laughter) Then I realized.
This information from society for them to donate hair.
In fact, it wasn't for me.
Open that it was for them.
I wasn't able to see myself as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital,
The children said, "Wow, you've sewed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
I told you what she said, "We don't take it, it's, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I did ...
It's to put the cateter, because I did my therapy before, the first one made a pork, I received a kit from the hospital.
Who doesn't cry?
I see a flavor.
A toothpaste and a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
This for my information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me back their procedures.
So, they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, passing through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do, they taught me.
We went on, we were joking, but that's how we think the child doesn't understand, right?
And I think the child doesn't know, she knows the name of chemotherapy protocol.
The procedures, all this, sometimes parents try not to talk to protect them.
But then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls."
From there to those who don't know what pharmacy is.
The pharmaceutic speaking is a strong medicine, what will it think?
That will fall your hair.
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused a lot of hair because it killed cells that doubled rapidly.
But that not only the tumor cells double quickly.
As well as hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to put catheter, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have both legs." "Ah, but then the profit comes running," and there I, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising.
I called health professionals and my creative friends, and we decided to open an NGO.
We opened BABA, called BABA, because it's the BAB of cancer.
What we normally did, those who do health information, are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But at the end, the patient approached the patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, so we put the kids to work.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love you with the heart, you see ventric drawings.
(Laughter) I think it's good, so we started to do this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If you have a sponsor in the audience ... Audience: Action!
For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there are Portuguese, they were, but we have a translator, and what is very asked in northeast, because children and parents are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do.
With that, we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
No kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That you need to have information about everything.
For example, I don't know if you know more, when they do events, black children earn much more present and pay attention than children.
But sometimes the doll child has already done the treatment, he has no cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at BABA website, that this doesn't have.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, dark, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?
Then you think, I receive calls from parents and mothers with healthy children, who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but have you ever thought that in this room there's a child with an adult who, in the case, was me, would people look at me to move to the window?
To see, your father has a good life, and when we need help, when we need empowerment, when we need self-esteem.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important that we give a little bit of attention to this too, not only to patients for society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others.
(Applause) In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, that's not easy.
The dependency here gives me disease and brain disease, and a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, really, the answer has?
Inside us.
To treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right.
It's in the search of what we thought about several things, and one of these things is in our own organism.
This organism that has to be its own defense mechanisms, that can protect itself from great threats, one of these defense is in our brain, it's called "encophalic damage."
The matocefálic barrier, although it seems a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and that make it...
The bacteria, viruses and harmful substances, don't enter the brain and don't do it bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the packaged packaging barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrofogo cites it and neutralize it.
Today.
Is that it?
We couldn't join these two things.
to help our patients?
Two mechanisms of defense, which are inactive, which are ours.
(Applause)
Some years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities.
They produced anticpios.
Contracts drugs itself.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
Let's go!
It's enough!
There's no need for more drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Applause)
What about me and my team?
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-comphophs are big molecules, and then that problem that the barrier init of being false had to let the drug go freely, stop existing, because when the user...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is linked to a big and "pum."
It's no longer the barrier in the plate of doing it.
(Applause)
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is.
OK?
Here, on your right, we have a while that hasn't received a vaccine: these white dots you see?
It's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
(Laughter) When these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it pass freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Here you see on your left side.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, they're arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they get stuck inside the box or more inhibited what doesn't happen with the rats they receive with Caindo.
So, what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market and to help people gain freedom, we believe that this treatment will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependence.
What knows, in a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time.
A time?
To decide.
A time to gain freedom again, and ...
Discuting with themselves, if they want.
Using or not using drugs, thank you very much.
I'm being.
A psychotherapist.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to read and say that -
Besides.
It's so horrible.
Besides?
In psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
At the end of everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
Whether it's hurting, loses, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Patology of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
"Of course.
Great meeting, TEDx.
It's right.
It's here.
No, music is being.
It was stunned from the beginning.
What is the norm?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Maybe that.
The most deadly.
What is it?
Your lady.
How far can I understand?
There are two fundamentals.
The most important part of the norm is the context.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
I'd respect the fact that not always.
The norm didn't exist.
Not always.
It existed there.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times?
What?
We live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dehumanity?
In your word?
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This is adapting to a sick system?
And keep it?
I've been.
A worker?
There's more than 30 in one year.
from the International University of Paz.
Aipasse.
And people think that peace is to be a good one.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's good to share!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes ...
A little bit of relatives.
The soldier for peace.
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must go to that person ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A desperation, conscious, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of it.
from a family shell.
When is my daughter?
Isabela.
She was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked me.
What princess do you like most?
The ballet sheet, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought.
"You see?", he replied.
I like all the May's writing.
I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who break.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling in your own skin.
A pain ...
The contradictions.
That the Northetics don't feel.
People who looked for me.
The panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured had open doors of perception.
In fear, isn't it just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's a myth.
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests.
Being deertified, these people would dismay.
I respect a lot.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why in Africa ...
Are the people considered crazy?
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a blink that captures.
The cultural contradictions.
Sistenic.
And sometimes I fail.
And how did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And not to talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent.
That we call.
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is in Armodes, we don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I think.
In an occasion, I came to give a seminary here.
from curta to sales.
"Uh."
The taxi driver?
Or knowing that I was ...
A psychotherapist told me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good!
She's kind.
He raises himself to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's silly.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand?
What do I want for you?
For lunch.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
(Applause) What's nothing against correctness?
At that moment, "Hi!
who suffered a distress!
So ...
Have you spoken?
It's from norms, machismo.
Does racism?
So, homophopia?
Of various?
Exclusions.
"Moramose!"
We could talk about the norm, it's environmental.
The nestmosis?
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything.
And that this auditorium catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, it takes me and doesn't realize, its existence doesn't make sense.
We like the taxes.
An inexorable globalization, a person who is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
To make the appology of the generalist.
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It's a concept.
In this education, which has also been here.
Are you ready?
How being?
A possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
of the wish it brought us.
Imprisonation.
It's what brings us a stage like this.
It's because we're honoring.
A promise we made.
We live here.
Just to a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would get lost.
So ...
In the foundation of norms?
"Yes ...
The context.
There's another one.
Very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said.
Today.
It's the question: What do we need to do to us?
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Money.
A bird.
From a bag, from a snake?
I think of a friend, "Wow!
They give him a step.
A Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
From a developing country, mother was Max, Niffin.
Chinen?
When I met my adoption, he told us that, since he was a child, he wanted to know that the human being was different.
And the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to his father?
That very respectful one.
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
He looked at a little light, and said he became the first estupidologist, (Laughter) a stupidology, a science that we need to study, it differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who?
What is absolutely...
And at Denoa, I like to remember Rulenturo.
The creator of biodiction, a great brother?
He'd say to us, "What do we need?
It's yours.
Ideópotalamic, being a good animal from the vacation to the chest which is cerebral.
The question.
It's stupidity because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's high.
Right.
To have diplomas and universities.
Coolified.
Doing like a person talking about development?
with graphs, branches.
Sufisticable?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, shaking it.
"Of course."
"Nice," he also said.
What for him?
I had only one.
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
In this human stubbornness.
And he agreed: Einstein.
In relation to the universe.
I still have my doubts.
But I need to say that I agree.
Diainist and DJ.
Machinevine, although she doesn't respect each other.
And considering what?
They are pointing out not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the norm.
Human beings?
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
to serve.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inacabase, it's unpleasant.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen and go to the sea.
We don't.
We are born unpleasant.
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
Have you heard of this?
School for tartarugas or...
(Laughter) You're helping.
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain.
Since the 17th century, it seems that it's only about developing a rational land, no.
It's said.
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
Emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
It's essential!
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
His own.
Confucious.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided.
My heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Do you quote?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted wasn't that day anymore, the borders.
Until justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, "Do you change clothes?"
And five minutes, I lead to be a whole existence.
It was exchange.
of Corrics.
This is the task.
In that sense?
A nurmose?
It refers to an evolutionary estagnation.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust.
which is the greatest discovery of the 21st century.
Is it the human being?
Now, on the contrary, the question is: how to adhere?
21st century.
Human beings?
Nothing less than that finds this paradox.
In the future.
The new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious, it's in dimensions.
People don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being.
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know themselves how to be, to smile, when to come.
Did someone ask?
I enjoyed it.
Say God.
And IT.
He said, "Fured."
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially!
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking.
It doesn't happen from a story we tell.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned with us.
This story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was incendiated.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flood.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
I would go back in the middle of the bus and go back.
With patience.
Ladies.
That's it.
What ladies?
I was playing in the middle and I am, "Intactufo, João, seeing that," said more, or "Go a flower?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
"Are you going to turn off this fire?"
Living down, isn't it?
And I've already said, "I know I don't."
Let's go to Tatu.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with two intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because 100 years are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little.
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions.
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
I do it with others, with others.
Comundo and comestive.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
We studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a Gante River.
The beija-floua!
He doesn't have any ideology, he doesn't have any flags, he's not blaming anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of him.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
And all of us who are necessary?
All of us.
At some point you'll be here, you don't need to be on this stage.
But on stage...
It's your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Maybe just complain.
from darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
And we straighten up?
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving one.
I want to conclude with the poem.
It's accessible.
Welcome.
Renevant.
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen, created others.
For other visions.
They built arms that had this meadow.
To be forgotten.
Sorry.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
More simple.
Always far.
And inside.
Thank you very much.
I entered a good school.
Decória.
I got good grades.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
And I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising or an accountant.
Since my mother has reality.
I chose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I said, "I've spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort."
I receive a duck.
I was a multinational company that didn't recognize me by their relatives.
Whether it's "treming," I work 12 hours per kidney, up to the limit of their strength.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
AC: Do interactive meetings, video games that wouldn't take somewhere.
show that you're important for the structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
I have a six likes point.
(Laughter) Tell someone.
Namoro, relief, wedding.
He's mini opponent.
Scale the corporate pyramid.
He sees the shirt, lambotas.
The job exchange.
P: Be a manager.
Carre of the firm.
(Laughter) "They wants the freel in happy hour marked."
AC: We have bad cuts and sapatenis.
I said, "Dad the shirt."
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son.
It's listening.
(Laughter) Take the car, yes, no year.
(Laughter) I bought an apartment in 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter) Disney, two years later, all seven days per Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami... (Laughter) more meetings that don't take somewhere.
People who are completely unqualified, being promoted before you, projects that start and dismoronate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
Take a shirt.
Creating socially every day, the first apartment on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle-time crisis.
The meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years, went fast, is, life is short.
Children in school, my God, how to grow fast, is short life.
That's it.
We'll have very cut in halluces from the center: you're a director, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we're going to sell the beach's apartment, children grew up and don't even want to see the shirt anymore.
The cholesterol is a little high, its body is flattered, like an astronaut that spent years floating in zero gravity, no face, and because of the healthy habit of passing toothpaste bread, I placed all the infections.
Audience: Yes.
Lut it out, cold lactose, green juice, semestal plan of the academia that you used for two months today is fourth, days of beet, liver hamburgues, after staying late, in the sign, to close a project, because life is too short to eat leface.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing a job, today, doesn't value the experience anymore.
The fear of everything, the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
The continuous fear that prevents you from living.
Fear of death, a brief sense of suffocation: Where's the air, otherwise I'm focused.
The complete disconnection with its decorative children from the 12 hours of work field for decades.
The retirement is empty.
Third of useless and unbalanced things.
You're a winner, this is your only consensus.
His life as an executive executive.
Take a shirt.
From wood, for the real time, thank you.
