I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What this said, that the true character of a society is revealed by the way I portray their children.
But in Brazil, we're living a paradox: our children are what we have of most precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our lives for them, and, however, our children are poorly treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, which is what I hope to do a little with you today.
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we offer them prison.
Gabriela's mother wants to have natural birth, in that moment of relationship, of affection with her daughter to receive, along with her husband, this baby that will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal birth, and rapidly the hospital industry, but it's very convincent, that produces culture of blindness, hunger, and replaces her, and replaces her that she can take a mammal, a way, because of her pregnancy, that we're strong, that we're strong, that we're strong, and we're strong, and we're strong, we're strong, and we're strong, in two months, that we'll have hunger, in two months, that we'll have hunger in our society, in two months, that we'll have hunger, in two months, in our society, in two months, that we'll have hunger, that, in two months, in our society, in two months, that we'll have hunger,
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: premise, experpt!
The maternal milk, Tadinho, Entrô, is breastfeeding, but industries spread directly to the doctor, making a doctor his marriage, convinced of his nutritional qualities, in congressions, and sponsoring entirely the medical society, being one of the biggest causes of damage in Brazil, and Bela grows, because vovão can't take care of it.
Convide is what gives us the intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children and we're losing this, and the child loses little with the most important people in their lives.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar, crocantes abroad, all the weapons that the media tells us to give frozen food, what the supermarket expands the brilliant Brazilians.
And this brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploiting in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy because it comes in a number of agrotoxes, and we are world consumption champions of agrotoxes, this sink of the intoxication of childhood also leads serious problems.
Audience: Yes.
We looked at the window, and saw the landscape passing, in the form of meditation. However, today, two babies and two tablets for each one, if we can't give something in the car, it has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run, play, go out, and, however, we used to play teams, in the moment of relief, family of a laughing person, of things that stay in the memory of a child, but it's not great, it's not great, it's not great, it doesn't exist, people.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child needs the most - this exists, it comes from there, but you can say, "Iphoric, the hypothesis."
This is the name "IPOR," which I opened her watching four hours on television a day, she spend more time on television, the Americans were in recording and in our work, and they're bounds of what is most important to us, creativity and imagination, and we're breastfeeding this from our children, with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction because we have less time at school.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, doesn't go to the park, the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family comes to us week, which is "o," very well, but it will be masacrated by advertising, by consumer values, and this advertising is co-bod obesity, it's an obesity that explodes in her capacity, distinguish, distinguish, distinguish, fantasy, reality, that she fell in love, with values, like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
Audience: Yes.
The utility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, will disagree, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of the friendship behind them, and, obviously, those who need friendship are teenagers, and they are more a meditation class.
But she could meditate on the little square, people on the balance, the wonderful language: "Who has no meditation in the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." There is no better meditation than that!
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: "Merodization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, merosization, which is based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
This is our way of disseminating erodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we have eight, ten years of love and affection, this peculiar of autization of the end to childhood and eroticization for which?
Gabriela has peace, because she doesn't live with her. Instead of leading her life, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms, we're doing what the Americans call "hélicopterprinting," we interrupt between the experience of their children and what, when she needed, if he realizes that, sometimes, more, that parents don't have authority, a child, and, therefore, they don't develop secting mechanisms, they don't have authority, they don't need to read it.
What's the solution we're not going to give to evilted children, not reviewing all these problems, not thinking about this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, it's called "medicalization and the worst iny."
The quino de Mafalda says this: "Franced in a wonderful way, telling the story of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people going badly by our children, not only with the alliate children, the adults also, in a way, have water in the lawn.
Medicalization of the direct phenomena of today, as a philosopher already said, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution, but for all the complex problem of humanity, which is to disorder of attention and impatience, the three colors are the market that increases the most for depressives, in 2010 more than 2 million boxes, we need solutions, more than people, more than a solution, more than a solution, more than 15% of children today are very wrong.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we reflect on this, a very widespread TEDx solution, I'm already going through, and I'm going to pass in my time, but that's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today means "attack off," in almost all churches, "dizing" is to give a part of what we have the most precious for our childhood, which is our sacred, what we have the most precious today.
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes. This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's only to priorize, and if it doesn't happen during the weekends, we start with the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children, in relation to space, I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fourteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not good the cat to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
Yes, right?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This brings the importance of nature, between us; nature is deeply associated with health; it does well for rivers, it does well for the earth, it did the animals; things always behave there in a positive way, creating simple habits; and the interaction with nature probably with an open space, what it does well.
And when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about public spaces with nature, that promote bike lanes, free events of these spaces, baking urbanization, the gardens in the city, public transport, to take us with gold, and the green that produces good to be physical, being psychological, mental, and also, reivindicating because of public spaces, that facilitate us the contact with public space, with public spaces, with games.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "copaque" used earlier for resistance and citizens, and mainly it means to take public space with joy, because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas based on public interest, sustainability, and equity.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children, already outside, go to the city, take the public steps with a game, with play, who's coming here, will come very early, our children will get me up, and they also say, in 97% of social awareness, that there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's cool for us to participate in this.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so that the utopia works, exactly to not make us walk, that it makes us walk outside.
(Applause)
In 2007, I came across a large group of young and adults with disabilities, excluded from regular education, and since then, my biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
In order to discuss inclusion within school, with parents, children and partners, disabled people are very affected by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they introduce this to parents, to the community, and to society in general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think they are not able to have friendship.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education, and since he loved to run, and people didn't have the strength for this too, he was running all the time.
When I got to the clean field, I sought to know Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school, and what together we could do for him to do?
They improved the best learning.
The school?
To me, it was a place of despair.
(Laughter) Well, it doesn't mean it's a bomb, today he's very happy, he has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
He said I'm his best friend and, for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that the school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading, the school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And they can teach students to enjoy their own learning process.
The schools think that they are not able to assist these students and that they are not prepared to receive, but schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use and believe that they are capable and that these leaves inside the school.
To do well for them, it's going to do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning other people because school is like that.
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
AC: Do you want to know what I learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see it.
I learned deprived.
My hearing is living with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs with those who can't walk.
(Laughter) I learned to value my ideas, with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students: to create connections and lakes of friendship.
And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise.
With empathy, thank you very much.
Good evening.
Audience: Yes.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you, when I was a kid, I loved seeing my grandmother cooking in mine.
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Páscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that, until today, she asked me, "How, and why did I go to the kitchen, and that's the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking?"
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study philosophy, they rescued in me something that I think that modernization took away from many young people, and respect for nature.
So, I decided that we could change the way we are...
(Applause)
And it builds the food system through food, and I believe...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Trossé is a little from the rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way that we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
It's able to reestructure the food system, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
Today, Brazil is the world's biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers, and this is very complex, it's quantity and speed, and I believe we produce as cheaper, it's also the animal's life cycle, it starts to grow and produce in a way that its bodies don't end, and each Brazilian consumes on average five kilos of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse, in use and consumption.
I wanted to understand why, but the answer is because our current society.
So, I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, not only you're investing, there are the values that have inside it, and we take this interface to you, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food in terms of distribution is also not efficient, in cooking and nutrition.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are we watching those executives or those depressed people walking down the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because too, but arriving is something that people, many people think that we lose the notion of society, or as a form of rejection, as a form of synergy of feeding ourselves, and we have to revert this.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little jewels, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, they degenerated our nervous system, a mental dependency, a psychological dependency, that is, industrialized products, in excess is very harmful, and they end up creating a dependency that doesn't suffer physics, but it won't feed you.
And some of you still have a cake, instead of buying that little package right in the middle of the package... Look, half... (Laughter) Who here still makes a pick of bread, who takes little bread in the place of microwonds, look ... half a half ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) This question may seem like these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange panick for the microwaves' popcorn, it's an excessive packaging that could be a trash in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrialized products is very pre-gredicious.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think this food dynamic is a lot, this food system isn't healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
cooking brings independence, bringing autonomy, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, it simply process food, so if you let the industry feed you?
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, chicken dog.
What about a pizza?
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, should think that cooking a lot of meal, but, for example, if you leave the meal of mold, from night to day, the meal of the morning, gathering with a fresh street that you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the edge, in half an hour you have the meal, ready.
(Laughter) This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppet to arrive.
Speral of the book of Pizza: "I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: men, women.
So, by changing education, we teach children, we take the fair to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner: there's no child, child, adult, sex, there's no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook, so the children will go ...
I believe we have to change the dynamic of food, food, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutical industry of eating.
And cooking, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to license, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
(Laughter) I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education and prevention.
The future of food will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better, thank you.
Life is not here for us to live.
AC: But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Being here at the bottom, to talk about the power of transforming stories, is to go through my own story, because a large part of my mother's family is to be here, I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Butiá's land.
For me, and then, he got married with my autilha grandmother, and, after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world, happened yesterday, it was yesterday, we are our story, before looking at this future, we need to see who came back and honored stories all.
And then, I, who was working with advertising, who wrote stories and ads in 15, 30 seconds about products, this book helped me to live mourning, to have contected and to have told this story, to me, brings one of the most beautiful things about it, because the world of advertising had already been very small to me.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx, about everything they had done with him, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying, because that's what he'd always suffered and he wanted to share the story with others without fear.
And he, who was understanding this, was changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about acceptance and family.
It was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know him, I've also seen that the roof they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat, and they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed, I'll tell his story, many people.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
So, telling stories to me, but if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years, there are many people to be here training many people in a way that didn't have any shame, and, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule in this place.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage, and it's not the roof that courage has a heart colour, about it.
(Laughter) I told the story of Ave, ávio, the teacher of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we spent months preparing his speech at the Açador's TEDx.
And he changed everything, and there was always something that bothered him and me, it has to be by heart, every time you talk to me, you say to me, "This is all here, everything is here, about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he had been heard when he most needed, when he thought about Swicíde, when he had cancer."
What made him feel afraid to change, we are afraid to change, even though the most spoken word here, is that we will change, we transform ourselves, and we saw this today, that when we hear truths, but who is worried about learning how to talk, how to count, and we always get there and say.
I won't even listen to ourselves and to others.
And listening, we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to come embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time for people, because we're worried about our lives, we always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
And this, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
(Laughter) And empathy has another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various things I heard, abroad.
(Laughter) When she taught me that empathy too, I learned collectivity, when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give, when they ask for something, we have yes, we have at least a smile, and it doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and we realize that they make us who we are, and when we listen to others in truth, we transform ourselves, and, in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip ... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be doing this.
Libertating fear I wanted many people I know, at least one minute of rest, so they could look back and smile again, say that they have the right to change faith in some humans, of a poem I wrote myself, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to release many of the people I know, to return to them faith in life, faith, isn't determining, and to all, and to listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that in the earth, being told to me, that I don't belong to many spaces, or you may say there are judgments, where there are all sorts of stars, they are only belonging to their plurial spaces, there isn't this fat or thin, beautiful, rich, rich, and they're only related to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, from a moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born, yet, to resist and to exist, was always a life condition for me, and the right for life.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and understanding definitely that what is different, the universe is infinite, and, along with it, there are millions and millions of stars, but none is less important than the Greek?
And this wants to laugh with this exchange, before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was, and in this process, the bathroom, the bathroom, for me, was a layer of layer, where I laughed, where I looked at my body, where I questioned God, the reason to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into a better friend, he was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to put the towel in my head and dance rebels, because I've only rebelled until today.
Audience: Yes.
But the question is: what was in the bathroom, that wasn't in the other places, and it was denied for me, it's as if you enter a castle, spend some time there and leave a thread of fat, this path is harder, it's in the the theater that I've learned to deal with difference, lack of information, and you still have to learn to deal with the not acceptance of others.
They get bothered by their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come here, do you go after yourself, our new thing, there's no crossing faces, no, you're staying, you're going to pass?"
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's something crazy here who wants to see this extinct?
As a white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
And I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
I started to use my art as a way of deconstruction of pre-established ideas about me, and second, if we compare with the United States, for example, my strength, my life story, explaining to you how my essence, I was invited to live a trans-established character, I'm experiencing a model, I take a calder and a strength, for other people, not only trans, not only for a life condition, I didn't have an option, and I could requer that I could exhibit this novel, this condition for me, a life condition, that I could have a life condition, and for many people, there could be a life, and for me, a life of life, and for me, there can be a million people, and life,
ME: It's a responsibility, bro!
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
That's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
Even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they'd say, "They've been filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, and there's no price."
What has no price is to receive message from mothers from other trans, thank me, for teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me for seeing me there and seeing me, this has no price.
So, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm much beyond that, I'm much beyond trans, but to understand this, I'm an unknown post, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky is the refuge of allies human beings, but the future, no longer looks, me and the sky, that mark my soul, that's what I want, one being next to me, now I'm going to fly, I cried, very bright.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
I spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I couldn't often explain to the children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures, and I decided to do surgery there.
So, I took the courage, I had never been hospitalized, and at some point, I used to tell children, "Don't give Google, my belly full of pressure, I called nurse, and asked cancer, she said, "Yes, and it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and the committed gangs, until I sleep, and I asked to call my parents, and she said, "There is a visite time."
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website, and the only thing that information was safe at that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumour and with a few chances of healing.
And, in that time, I was realizing so much information that sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage with someone, if many times you can't even say the word "canscer."
I was loaded, opened what bothered me, forgot, threatened, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, the crazy was for them, that I wasn't able to see me as a doll, and, with that, I saw many other information that I thought wasn't the most suitable.
When I entered the hospital, a doll, I asked you, "No, now I've got you all the same, I've got cancer, the children said, "Wow, you cut your hair off to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
But the games were overwhelmed, and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a toothpaste, a toothpaste brush, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a slope, and I didn't have hair.
So, we showed me, they'd send videos, work with chemotherapy, passing through the radio, various procedures, until I couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, and, until one day, doctors started to call me, if we think the child doesn't understand, that the child doesn't do, that they're going to be hair, how we don't know, how we do it, how we do it, how we do it, how the teacher of health, how we could improve the patient, and we've done it, and we don't do it, and we't do it, and we've started to improve the patient, and we don't do it, and we't do it.
I think it's good, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide, this guide is to distribute for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year if there's a sponsor in the audience.
When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising child, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more than 40 hospitals in Brazil, sometimes the information is a pent, and we've started to dismistify and engage the patient, and what happened sometimes isn't only for children, and what we talk about, and we prepare, for example, doctors, sometimes we don't have one thing, we have one thing, we don't have one thing in the northernorth because there's one in northeast kit.
(Laughter) And what happens with this, and when you're the patient, how many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, weak, weaked, I received these materials and I thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of trouble at home, I want to take her to the hospital to see what's a difficult thing."
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need help, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We use all this information to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others. Thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because dependency here gives me a disease, and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Laughter) What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought about various things, and one of these things is in our own organism: one of these defense is in our brain, it's called packaging packaging barrier, despite being a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and brain veins and that make bacteria that viruses and non-violent substances don't enter the brain, don't let us down.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the pack of serphaly, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by cells, anticorposs, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
So, could we not gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities, realized that these people who used more drugs against their own drugs were almost as if the immune system told them this.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barrière to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
And then, that problem that the emitcephalic barrier had to let go straight away the drugs stop giving up, because when the user consumes drugs, a few years ago, we're researching, makes our immune system produce anticorposes against drugs, and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control them, and it's no longer on the barrier in Mars.
Look at this image here how this beautiful process is, OK?
Here, on the right of you, we have a rat that hasn't received a vaccine, and you can see, on the left side of you, there's a significant diminution of white dots you can see, it's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation, it pass freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, you're arrested in the blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependence, so what our group is working now is, in fact, to help people win freedom, or more inhibited, which doesn't happen with the rats receive cocaine, thank you very much.
Invisible, the air in the wind.
Invisible, the air we live in.
Uoooooool!
I'm being."
A psychotherapist.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to read and say that, besides.
Danorous, yes.
Narrator: Malen?
Psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who has already infelelelelled, lost, and me.
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I have to say that maybe, these are one of the charming.
Big meetings from this TEDx?
GG: Thank you very much.
It's here.
Our music is being.
Perfect.
Toting from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors filled with social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The legal war, for example, is an example, maybe the most mortal than the norm.
Up to where I can comprehend, there are two fundamentals of the most important of the norm, and it's the state of the system.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
Namornosis is a typical disease, and it won't always exist.
What do we live in a context?
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
Dishumanity, lack of listening, lack of care, lack of responsibility, where it predominates corruption, in its words, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
Is it a worker?
More than 30,000 years ago.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thegnancy: "How many wars, Perei, who comes, for a little payment."
What military for peace?
But with other weapons, weapons of responsibility awareness.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes, healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucious, an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
From a family house of Isabelo, she was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What is the princess you like most?"
The flywheel bark, sleeps it, the fallen asleep?
She thought and answered.
And I like all the maid's writing.
I also said, "I too."
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling in your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
All the people who looked for me were sensitive people who captured the panic disease, for example, that theoretmotics don't feel, to avoid being sensitive, who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is the fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests.
And being deertified, these people would dismay.
I respect a lot.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy are also considered sacred.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
Sistendic, and sometimes I fail.
And how did I say it?
What's crazy?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that the saints know, maybe, these people, at least in a great extent that we call "sikatic," are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here in Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
For loving it.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
It's this fabulous team that organized this meeting.
That nothing against certainty?
NJ: Yes.
At that moment, "Hi!
That you suffer a desire too.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo, racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
Namorphosis!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The girlfriend of another specialization, a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
And each of us is looking at the minimum of our memory, and we don't realize, our existence in the sense, we are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
To make the appology of the generalist, but it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe there's a concept.
In this education that has also been pointing out.
A possibility of solution that I have called calling, as being the deepest voice.
The wish that brought us the incarnation.
It's what brings us on a common stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
And we live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can tell if you didn't tell her to lose.
"So? What do you mean?
A foundation of norms?
It's the context.
There's another very important one: it's an evolution, it's also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves: What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us?
From now on.
A bird from a snake, from a face?
I ask a friend of Unippace.
An alternative Nobel Prize and a country commissioned by Mr Freeth Max, Chilean.
When I met my dose, he told us that since he was a child, he wanted to know that the human being was interested, "Linguage isn't culture, it's not..." It's humor, no!
One day, talking to his father, that very respectful, his father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
He heard a little light, and he said that he became the first studio.
Supidology is a science we need to study, it differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is absolutely...
One day, I like to remember Rolentor, a creator of biodiction, a great brother, and he told us that it should be a hipotalic idiot, be a good animal, from holidays to the chest that will be Bral.
The question is stupid because it reversed with rationality, a person can be highly stupid and highly rational.
To have qualified diplomas and universities.
And to do it as a person who is talking about sophisticated development, with graphs, like a person sitting on the branch of a tree laughing.
"So? What do you mean?
Ninist, also said.
that for him only had two infinite things.
The universe in this human tank.
And he agreed, "Yes, autism, in relation to a universe I still have my doubts."
But I need to say that I agree with Einstein and Max Nefing, although they are pointing not to the characteristics of the species, yes, of the norm, they are pointing and considering that humans ...
We are born to be, to flourish, it's not your nature, stupidity, on the contrary, to serve, then.
I intend to think about comfort.
That 2600 years ago said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's completely, we are not born human, we are humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen and go to the sea,
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
Have you ever heard of school for turtles or Tana Juras?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, about developing emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, of learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
[A.DE.]
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50 I knew what the precets of the sky were.
At 60, I heard sweet invitation.
In the 70s, I could follow my own heart instructions, because what I wanted wasn't anymore the borders of justice, the same as Alexandria' therapists.
They told us, 2,000 years ago, you exchange clothes in 5,000 million, it takes to be an entire existence to exchange roots.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The norm refers to an evolutionary establishment.
These are people who didn't invest in the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: will there be the 21st century for human beings?
And no less than this sees this swarm.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being, where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile at the time, to serve.
Someone asked for the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially?
I am.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we hear doesn't happen to you.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once, "I."
A forest.
Not to give up.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flow!
who would take a source, a water drop, and return, resiliently, another gota, lawyer in the middle of fire, and return with patience.
The bottle lines are already ...
Do you think that with these ridicules, or beija-flor, you'd play in the middle, "A Tartufo João, seeing that," said, "Well, silly, you'll turn this infernal fire?"
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
Now, I'm doing my friend Tatu, my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes, with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way, because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
Why?
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little of peace, a little of order, a little of love.
In this small part of the world, where the big world trusted each one of us, and if we don't do that, where can we be the ease of transformation?
That's why revolutions.
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
which is breathing consently, with the world and mystery, I can with others, I recommend a book to Corean de Marilyn Fex.
These spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a ground sloth radio.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stand up and we can do our part.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came, each of us talking about their water had water.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, there's your life story, telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle instead of just complaining the darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time for renewation.
I love it.
"You are."
I believed.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry will still save the world.
I want to conclude with the poem of Ceciliia Meréndez.
Renova.
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen, created others for other visions.
Both arms that had this remote.
To forgotten the harvest.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
But always: lower.
Always far.
And inside of everything.
That's it.
I entered a good school.
(English) choose.
I got good grades.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a billboard, since my first one has a income.
I chose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
Some multinational multinational that didn't recognize me by their relatives, be "treming".
She works 12 hours per kidney, high up to her strength's limit.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
Do interactive meetings, video games that won't take to anywhere, show that you're important for structure, more than working, it's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
The car, one point, sixlex.
(Laughter) I found someone named, girlfriend, wedding.
He, the Minioponents, stays the corporative pyramid, seen on shirt, lambotas, employment exchange.
In other words, the manager, the firm's car.

It's a continuous feeling of changing the tea, the void that the passes in the mall on weekends can no longer applaud.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken, seen the shirt.
The baby is socially up every day.
The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle school crisis, the meeting with my college colleagues, my God, as the years went fast, is, life is short.
My son in school, my God, as they grown fast, is the hidden life.
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
(Laughter) The first place: weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we'll sell the beach apartment, the children grew up and don't want to go further, seen the shirt.
The cholesterol is a little high, its body is flattered, like an astronaut here spent years fighting in zero gravity.

He saw the wood shirt for the real time.
Thank you very much.
