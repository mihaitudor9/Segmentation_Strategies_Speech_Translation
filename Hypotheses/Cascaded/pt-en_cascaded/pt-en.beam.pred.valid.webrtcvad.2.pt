(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of more precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our lives for them, and, however, our children come from very maltratized to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
(Laughter) If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which are most of them according to Mandela's criticism, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
What if they rebel?
We offer her prison, but even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters who are here.
Things don't go well either: we may not commit more sincere crimes, I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
And we'll get it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Gabriela's mother wants a natural birth, here is the moment of affection link with her daughter, to receive with her husband, this baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal medicine, and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessable.
Remember that, of course, there are necessary cemarries for each one of these peculiares that we're going to be, replaces a surgical accident, a woman is hurt, normal, evil, dangerous, painful, that generates a red light statistics in our country, against 15 to 23% are made by C-sectionian.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, you'll tell reality here, you can take a mammal here, a formula like this, besides a grandma, in the case of her, that is needed, she's even hungry.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother goes home and says, "You've grown up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, strong?"
The child is crying, every month is cold, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms, they awake.
He quickly experimented, and his nappy milk entered him, he's a lover, but he just comes with a lot of love, and he, infinitely superior to any of these forms.
(Laughter) But industry advertising directly to the doctor, making a doctor their marriage, convinced of their nutritional qualities, knowing that they develop the baby's development.
And, in this way, we lose and sponsoring, with a lot of prizes and dinner and congresses, and sponsoring entirely the medical societies conquering the sympaty of the pediatric, that end up unconsciously being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil.
The privileges of my breastfeeding and searching through the first sin, which is the privation of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the permit, she will have to go to the grocery store, because grandmother cannot take care of it.
I have work to do at home, in the weekends, and it will pass on sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, it will arrive home, the parents are tired of tired of a long journey of work, of sponsorships, and they will coexist little with their daughter.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone.
We're at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of exterrible and sinister of childhood personalization, and they're just exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderful healthy, because of a rich food.
In fat, saturated fat, enormous amount of salt and sugar access, crocantes outside, molds inside, for weapons that the industry, through food engineering, highly developed.
Do it.
so that children can be completely addicted to industrialized food and in this way, unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
Because they are scavengers, the sin inxication of childhood that also brings serious problems, and, for four months, someone knows that, highly negative from the involved of a child, they have an absolutely explosive energy, they need to run around, go out.
However, in our urban lives, they don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, to stay home, we used to play personal games, it was an incredible moment, so today, two babies and two states for each one, if you can't do anything in the car.
(Laughter) Even in the moments she needs the most about awareness, that's what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this does, Gabriel watches four hours on television a day, she's massacrated by advertising, she's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because we have less school time.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, not to the store, the family does the classical show of the Brazilian family in the weekend, which is...
Very well, where it will be more massacrated by advertising, by consumerism values, and this advertising is a widely speed.
The mobility that explodes in her ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, that explodes her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, according to love, and that instills in the value of appearance.
The utility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, will disagree, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil isn't alcohol beer, it's not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of the friendship behind it, obviously, is the one who needs the most friendship are teenagers and they are deeply affected by child consumption.
Gabriela fica with the agenda full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises, to relax this stress, they add a classroom than meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, a wonderful language: Who has never meditated balance?
Look at the sky, look at the floor, look at the floor, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, "Merudization, look at the floor."
That uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, meradization, which is based on sexism, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put in a tribe, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she's going bad at school, the school's guilt has to talk to her teacher, when she's eight or ten years old.
She gathers a lot, if what she needed would be presence.
She realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, with two or three years old, that realizes that parents don't have authority, we need people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms, we know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, we need to give to our children and we are losing this capacity instead of that.
They don't have life experience, so they don't develop mechanisms to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, and certainly the world will give them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the superpower in childhood: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, birty, and will get sick, will eat too much, it'll be obese, it'll be ill in school, it won't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What was the solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late for them to behave well, it's called "medicalization" and it's the worst of the pecates.
Going to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact.
The medicalization of today's most direct phenomena, you can see that in the United States, 15% of children are now getting pregnant with this individualistic society, what the factory that is producing is exactly medicine.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, as well as medicine, which is for the disorder of attention and interactivity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't an epidemic of disease, this is a massacre against childhood, we're rotating, normalizing and preventing some of these geniuses, if some of these genius, in humanity, we'd have lost that wonderful thing as the trouxen grains.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths, and problems are very complex, I don't see, without end of sines and factors that feed each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simply, easy and invariably wrong.
Obviously, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And, regarding time, what can we do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today, means a discomfort payment, almost all the churches?
The décima is to give a part of what we have the most precious of our childhood, of our children, which are our sacred.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Time, our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40, a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing, and if it doesn't happen in the weekends, we start with one at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children, in relation to space, I'd like to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health and courage of life, not a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
(Applause)
(End of video) How would he be?
You can open your eyes, tell me if you fit in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure that most of you, yes, this shows little the importance of nature, it's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, it's all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience. I started that, with Patricia, back then, when I was giving my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!"
I talked about the convergence to auditability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
All health does well the body does well, it does well for rivers, it does well for the earth, it sees animals, it's riding a bicycle, it's half the body, my cities, bottles, pollution, and collective transportation does well for the time to live together, reduces pollution.
Things always go into slow in a positive way, creating always viciosous, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it is, it will cut us off the fabrics, it will give us moments of consciousness especially to children, who will know each other and learn how to deal with them, we will develop empathy, and promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physic, well being psychic, mental, and it will reduce all the problems of childhood, we're not talking about penetrating the wall.
And for the city, hug the cities and play in the squares, occupy public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, and with relief, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and also not only the initiative of physical users that facilitate us with public space with nature, that promote cycle, free events of these places, the baia aborization, public transport gardens, to take us these places, safety.
Unforgettable and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocuparketically used for resistance and citizens today, it means to occupy public spaces with joy.
And ...
Mainly participate in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catastrophes, as happened in São Paulo.
You can see here a photo of the company "Birens," a source of water from São Paulo for 30 to 40 years, and today.
Imagine the public policies voted to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
With transparency and accounts, there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, which is coming here, and will come very early: our children will get me in, reducing the inequality from the social point of view, and from the environmental point of view, which makes everything we already know, right?
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to convince, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature, we'll make them love nature, and defended in the future, because we only defend what we love.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces with the game, with play, with entertainment, with participation.
The more I get closer, the more he moves away, if I take a thousand steps, he pushes a thousand steps away, so for the purpose of utopia.
Just to not make us walk, to make us walk abroad. (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2007,
I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disability.
Listening to regular education.
And since then?
What's my biggest challenge?
It was to look at the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project called "Café terapêutico."
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a truly inclusive society?
to discuss inclusion within school.
With his parents, with his son.
And with my partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities -
Sometimes they're left aside.
Have friends.
They can't think they are not capable.
to have friendships.
to feel like acting with people.
I put the case of the student Igor, for example.
What was the other school he studied?
For four years, he didn't go into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
People didn't have the strength either.
So, for four years, he stayed in the court.
Participating in all physical education lessons.
As he loved running.
He was running all the time.
GG: T arriving isn't a clean field?
I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school.
And what together could we do?
So that he could ...
They achieved better learning.
The school?
Forgor, it was a place.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a pump?
Today, he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
And I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
A healing.
The learning process itself.
The schools think.
That they are not able to assist these students and that they are prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
He has to use it.
And believe it.
That they are capable.
And what do these small ones inside the school?
To do well for them, it'll do good for other students, for the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
Why is school like this?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
AC: Do you want to know what I learned at the age of ten years working with disabled people?
And I learned to appreciate my view.
They survive with people so they can see it.
I learned to use my hearing.
surviving with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
Or those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
With those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart.
And the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendships.
And what's most important for society?
What about learning?
It's an exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
NJ: Yes.
I always liked eating.
But I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
To cook in the city.
Cozinhar, working in the kitchen, she who took account of Christmas seeds last year, Paáscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, studied food philosophies that could allow food to have powers, let's say.
Food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine itself.
So I decided to study a little about "yurveda" and macrobiology, because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
To build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
It's a bit trouble.
From life.
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can connect with nature.
(Sigh) Ia!
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
Food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health.
But also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's to do it.
To restore the food system?
Changing the food dynamic.
The production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the process of meat production, for example, there are two principles that lead.
The meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more ...
If you produce, the cheapest you produce.
Worst is quality and...
Memor is the cost of the environment and our health in terms of speed.
The animal's cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle, is artificially accelerated.
He ...
It begins to grow and to produce in a way that their bodies lose.
There's a time that doesn't hold, and it starts to lose, decrease drastically.
Your quality of life.
Your health and your life time.
So ...
I believe that we ...
This is very complex because, as it may cost so little, you can create an animal, you can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's quilo was cheaper than tomato's quilo.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables.
The production process on the industrial scale is also very...
Let's say it's harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment.
Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but even so.
They keep polluting and keep polluting.
This abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer ...
It's because our current society ...
There are inverted values because a person concerns for a change of values.
If you don't buy a failed perfume, because you think it's gone ...
There's an allergic reaction because it doesn't know the procedure doesn't know which type of chemistry is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover this change of values, and we need to teach people.
to appreciate organic products because when you buy, for example, a pack of lettuces.
It's a bit of organic interface, you're paying, not only you're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go: investing on social media, many times, they don't know that behind that leface, someone took care of all the love and affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think - right?
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why we are going hungry, and the reason...
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption?
Also...
It's the way we...
They consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in São Paulo.
Why if I took it, put it on?
In the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Looking at those executives or those overwhelmed people walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because catting is something that people, many people think it's a waste of time, but actually.
It's very important, so she'd go.
It's almost a fifth, but because it doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding itself.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening the street space, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of Salvador and sugar which are the three, is trufficious, right?
And these, mainly the taste reuses end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, but also a mental dependency, a psychological dependency, a physiological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products are too harmful, I don't even call them food. For me, they are made up of food, because you can even consume, if the website does, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
(Applause)
And who here still makes panel popcorn, with a few panels in the place of microwaves, look...
Half half... (Laughter) Who here is still a cake, instead of buying a little bag with a little package ... Yeah, half of the half, the film...
(Laughter) This question may seem, these two questions may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you change the panick, the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health.
It's consuming.
Chemistry that you wouldn't put, I'm absolute certainty in your panick.
And you're also polluting with the packaging from microwaves, from a packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think consumption.
It's excessive of industrialized products, it's really very harmful.
So, let's talk ...
To summarize this question of the food production process, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not sweet, it's not...
It's not working, and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook...
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Cozinharing brings independence, it brings high.
self-knowledge brings autonomy, brings safety, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you ...
That's it.
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, or fallen dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza, because we don't even know how to do more, right?
Ah, no, man.
Where is the rice the bean, where is the beijion rice from each day?
Who had our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think that doing very work, very anti-personatic food, is waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean, from night to day, wake up in the morning.
And ...
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
Spering or delivering of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
Menine, girl.
Children, adult, elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender.
Everybody can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children taking their fair to choose the vegetables they'll have for dinner.
It's by putting practical children: a battle bed, a lava lousa.
Simple things from everyday life?
We can...
These children will grow, build a better future.
A holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
There are many people, I think it's from the supermarket shelter, so the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the industry.
It's pharmaceutical because they'll be much less sick.
growing up eating cash food, healthy food.
I believe we have to ...
Change.
Addynamics.
In food, we have to change our own - I.A.
The value ... ours ...
Too ...
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Education ...
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose foods?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Life is not here that we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My torment, Mario Güeyce, was the first blind planter.
Tlavora mechanized in Brazil, here in the land of Butiá.
For me and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, he got married with my father, and after having had seven children inside my mother.
I arrived in this world, marriedly, it was yesterday, we, at 50 years ago, are the stories we tell, that make us who we are and when we count, we transform ourselves and listen.
And it also transforms.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
But are we our history before looking at this future?
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored, all stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early, I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to live the mourning, and I know it helped a lot of people too.
So having used this and contacting this story brings one of the most beautiful things about it.
That is the power that people can, when they feel welcomed in the story of others, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously somebody ...
Come on, you'll sit on your lap of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
And I went by ...
to help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had been very small for me.
So, I started to do: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk ...
Two years ago, she's bringing TEDx.
About entrepreneurship with purpose, something so uncomfortable today.
But he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying.
Because that's what he's always suffered.
And he wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with them.
Except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints.
A right about all that had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, to be to keep complaining about who did that with us?
And if not, to inspire people that they can be welcomed and that they can take responsibility who they are, as we've already said here.
Without fear.
And he, who understood this, was changing his tunnel, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful!
"And ...?"
I really like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
Also, having seen that the root they imagined, that Tiago had...
It was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell him his story.
A lot of people!
If he welcomes me in his story, the last week, he sent me a big saying ...
That many boys have been looking for it even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that he wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way.
That I had no shame at all.
So, tell stories to me ...
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm bringing a lot of people to be here.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Tell something funny shows your children's pictures, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it.
I told the story of "Ave," the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, and he researchs listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks earlier, I'm.
From his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what you've generated with this, every time you talk to me, you tell me, everything's here, everything's here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk about listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was listened to, when he needed the most, when people suicide when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many addiction courses, oratory, writing courses, but who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we're going to change, let's change.
There's always this fear, and, like this fear, we always get there and say.
I won't even listen."
What about us?
And for others.
And the listening ...
You see, also, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
But we...
There's no one minute.
To look at others, to come hug and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
CR: For people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) This, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
(Laughter) And empathy has another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most various things I heard, abroad.
When she taught me that empathy too, I learned high school.
Why?
We need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and we tell, that make us be who we are, and when we listen, with the other in truth.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation that was this process here for me.
I was outside my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like doing this so much?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me ...
And for everyone, I came from a poem I myself wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
From the 4th of the flaws, the salts of the ...
of the values of the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
To show them faith in life.
Faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change the right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds of non-profit, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Liberation of fear.
I wanted many people I know -
They had at least one minute of rest.
Then they could look at their side and then smile again, count and listen.
That you, what stories you're going to tell about your lives, what stories you want to tell about you.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Music)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, where there are all types of stars and stars, they don't have labels, they're belonging to their plurial spaces, there's no fat storm or thin, beautiful, rich and poor.
It's just a legacy of existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed over my life, a phase in which I was denied the right of just being.
However, I don't look for acceptance, from the moment I recognized myself, but, respecting, therefore, resisting and existing has always been a life condition for me, and the right for life.
So, why are we so small, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy?
And to definitely understand that the different one agrees.
Audience: Yes.
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals, so that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
The different thing is beauty, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this is rich, this exchange.
So, I want to ask you a request, I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
While starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and, in this process, the bathroom, the bathroom, for me, was a golden ball.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, or where I questioned God the reason I was different.
Well, the bathroom turned into my best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
(Laughter) But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and that was denied for me?
The best, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different from that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, for lack of information?
And when it comes to the trans universe, this path is even more difficult.
I researched on the Internet, but let's see people like me, I didn't even know what trans people were, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of girls transitating, and that desire to grow up inside me, blind, I want to turn into trunks too, like this, everyone will come, so she thought at the beginning of the wrong way.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started looking for my real teenage years, and I started to get rid of it.
It's difficult when you enter a couple, spend some time there, this is a beautiful ballole, because of this process, it has painful phases, and you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others.
In the case of us, weird, for example, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, is it that you're hostile, our new thing, there's no cross-function faces?"
No, that's it, it's going to happen.
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is there any crazy person here who wants to live such an extinct?
While the existing man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 people who were killed here in Brazil, in 2016, some 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
Being a trans isn't an option, but, in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's no one... I take a calder and a little force, resistance, 35-year expectation, there's no one who was still like that, that we could better measure this panel, but it's not.
I could be here the whole afternoon, tomorrow whole afternoon, explaining to you how I transded my life story, but each one of us is the protagonist of their own story, understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
I'm depending on ourselves, for example, I'm the living proof of it, after I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use mine.
My art as a way of deconstructing ideas, preestablished about me.
I created in Cana no YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to the other day, magazine layer, J, and YouTube, and the apex of my career, I was invited to live a trans character, in an immensority that exhibited this novel for more than one million people in 130 countries.
(Cheers) (Applause) It's a great responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be ugly to all that I represent with it.
But as I did, abused, I went there and gave my name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
It's as much as in all the subjects that went out on me on the internet, they said, "It's a frame of comment like a man who's capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What's no price?
Audience: Yes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
What doesn't have a price is this baby message from other trans mothers, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
Because you see me there, and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
Understanding the difference is something that can definitely change the world, but today I also understand that I don't want to be just three trans.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm far beyond trans, but to understand this, I have an unknown posture, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference add, I'm much beyond that.
The sky ...
It's the refuge of allies.
Who was me, a loved one?
And don't even realize blue?
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
I don't look at myself anymore, I can't stop, I've already gotten away from my courant.
From the past?
Except that they remain their scars that mark my soul.
But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I cried, thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I couldn't often explain to children what cancer was, treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarium sixth, that doctors called "teratoma," one of them once said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, you won't take a sixth grade."
(Laughter) Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors and nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there.
I took courage, I had never been established, at some point.
It was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later, and in the same yesterday I stayed with children with cancer, and I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
And ...
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
Then I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's been a visitor's pain."
And then, I asked her to give me her hand.
Even for me to sleep.
I was only running after the room, using cancer, measures and committed gangs.
Audience: Yes.
I'd say to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, not when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website, and the only thing that happened to me ...
That was the safe information at that moment that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumour and with a few chances of healing.
And, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
which sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "c cancer"?
And I was a doll ...
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
(Laughter) So, at that moment, I realized.
This information from society, for them to have hair, in fact, it wasn't for me.
Peru that was for them.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with this I went to see many other information I thought wasn't the most suitable.
(Laughter) When I got into the hospital, a doll, the children said, "Wow, you laughed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
I came to you, "No, that one, we don't take it, it's it, you can stay close to me, not catching it."
But the games overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I did ...
Putting the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, I did the first porvey, I received a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, a sabonete came, a toothpaste and a toothpaste of teeth, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
I had no hair, (Laughter) And that for my information, and I started photographing all the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent kids to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We started playing, but we think that children don't understand, they think they don't know, they know the name of chemotherapy, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try to not talk to protect them, but then the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy.
The pharmaceutic speaking is a strong medicine, what will it think?
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it kills cells that double their hair quickly, which will fall off.
But not only the tumor cells double quickly, but also the hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who will place catéter, you can come here and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs." "Ah, but then I enjoy it coming here," and there I, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising, I called doctors, health professionals, and my creative friends, if we decided to open an NGO.
We opened BABA, called BABA, because it's cancer BAB.
What we normally did, those who do health information, are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
(Laughter) But the patient approached the end, the patient's entrance is in the middle, but, at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, so the children could work. So we spent a long time listing what we couldn't understand that doctors talk about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something similar, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
Ten ventricyric drawings.
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator," and the guide required in North, Northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate.
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do, with that we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit ... So, what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it, when they do events, dark children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children.
But, sometimes, the doll child has already done the treatment, there's no cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, but you can look at Biabake's website, that yesterday.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship?"
And since I think, I receive calls from parents and mothers with healthy children, who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that in this room there was a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see and father with a good life, and when we need help.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
Audience: Yes.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, because we think it's very important: I entered the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers)
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because dependency here gives me a disease and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of those defense that can protect itself from great threats, this organism that has its own defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats.
The myatocephal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain.
And that make these bacteria viruses and harmful substances not enter the brain and don't do it bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the packaged packaging barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
AC: Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus, and toxic substances as well, in this video, you can see the macrophogo, and neutralize it.
What do I like?
So, is it?
We couldn't join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours.
(Applause)
Some years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drug quantities.
To produce an anticope.
Contracts drugs itself.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barrière to help these patients?
(Applause)
And me and my team?
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-comphophs are big molecules, and then that problem that the barrier in Maths had to let go freely the drugs stop existing, because when the user ...
It's consuming drugs, this tiny molecule is linked to a large molecule and, "pum," it's no longer in the kitchen barrier, you're validated.
Audience: Yes.
Look at this image here how this process is beautiful.
What's going on?
Here, on your right, we have a while that hasn't received a vaccine: these white dots you're seeing -
It's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation, once we were able to imunize them, when these un immunized rats receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Here you see on your left side.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was stopped, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater radiation concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocking the passing, you're arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they get stuck inside the box or more inhibited what doesn't happen with the rats they receive with cocaine.
So, what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people win freedom, we believe that this treatment is the therapeutic vaccine or the antidrogas vaccine.
It can be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency.
What knows, in a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time.
A time to decide.
A time to gain freedom again and ...
Discuting with themselves, if they want to use not to use drugs, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
Interapute?
More than 40 years ago.
I want to tell you that...
Besides.
Danorose.
Besides?
In psychosis.
There's a tennis disease.
Thank you very much.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infileno, he loses, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
An atrogen of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
To have this great encounter TEDx?
Thank you very much.
It's here.
"Oh no, music is being."
Toting from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some meditation.
The war?
Cool, for example.
It's an example.
Maybe I'm just that.
The most deadly.
What?
Valor Music.
How far can I understand?
There are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
Danormose in is the location.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
I'd respect the fact that not always.
The norm didn't exist.
Not always.
It's shot.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times...
What do we live in a context?
Where it predominates -
Violence ...
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dishumanity in its word.
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapt to a sick system?
What do I do?
I've been.
A worker?
There's more than 30 in one year.
from the International University of Paz.
Or Unipas.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars?
"I said, what comes to be."
A bit of payments.
What military for peace?
But with other guns.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person should, that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of...
From an appeal to the family.
When is my daughter Isabela?
She was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked me, "What?"
What princess do you like most?"
The ballet sheet, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought...
And he answered, "What?
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
I left.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
(Laughter)
Sometimes...
Because it has to be the safety of feeling in your own skin.
I love the contradictions.
That the Northetics don't feel.
People who looked for me?
With panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured!
It had open doors for awareness.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests...
And these people have experienced being desertified.
I respect a lot.
Dominated people.
Psychiatrics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why in Africa ...
People considered crazy.
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a "paragus" that captures.
The contradictions...
Culturate.
Sistenic.
And sometimes I fail.
And how did I say that?
Singue?
The difference between the ...
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
He doesn't want to talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call ...
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I think of my wedding, that I came to give a semester here.
It's short, come to me.
And I said, "What am I doing?"
The taxist, knowing I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
He's stupid.
It's the target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
"What am I trying to do this?"
"I'm in the armosis."
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, as ...
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
And that's when I said,
who suffered a distress!
So ...
Have you talked about norms, machismo?
Does racism?
From homophopia?
Of various?
Exclusions.
A song!"
We could talk about the norm, is it environmental?
The girlfriend does.
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything.
(Audience) Good afternoon.
And that this auditorium catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mimo, memory, and doesn't realize its existence in the sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about...
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe...
It's a concept.
In this education, which has also been ...
Very good.
How do I feel?
A possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
of the wish it brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage like this.
It's because we're honoring.
A promise I made.
We live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would panded.
So ...
In the foundation of norms?
"Yes ...
The context.
It's another one.
This is very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said.
Today.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves.
What differentiates?
But a human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
From now on.
A bird.
From a snake, from a monkey?
I think of a friend, "Wow!
It gives us a space.
An alternative Nobel Prize, economy?
From the developing country, Mãe Fred Max Life.
Children?
When I met my illness.
He told us that, since he was a child, he wanted to know that human beings had a difference.
Of the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
One day, talking to his father -
That very respectful one ...
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
Audience: Oh!
(Laughter) It differentiates, for example, of the unbelievable, who sends a little light, and says that it's become the first estupidologist, stupidology, a science that we need to study.
That's absolutely...
In Denoa, I like to remember Rolentur.
The creator of biodiction, a great brother?
He'd say to us, "What do we need?
It's yours ... in ...
The hipotalic stupid, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest Bral?
The question ...
It's stupidity because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly clear.
Rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Olympics.
And to do like a person talking about development?
Fabrics with graphs.
Suphisticated?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, closing.
So ...
"Nice," he also said.
What for him?
I had ...
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
It's human stupidity.
And he agreed, "Aimist."
In relation to the universe.
I still have my doubts ... Aaaaaaah!
But I need to say that I agree.
From Einstein and Maxleyphing, although we are respecting us.
And considering that...
They are pointing out not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the norm.
Human beings ...
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
"What does it serve?"
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's in complicity.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A tartaru wasn't born and has never gone, have you seen and go to the sea?
We don't.
Are we born unpleasant?
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or...
I said, "You have laws.
It seems that it's only about developing a rational testimony, no, it's perfect, we're imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, that since the 17th century.
It's said.
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
They said how to see emotional intelligence, unirical intelligence of dreams, how to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
At 15...
I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
At 60?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted wasn't that day anymore, the borders.
For justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you change clothes.
It has been an entire existence in five minutes.
It was to exchange.
How do you think?
And this is the task.
In that sense?
A nursery ...
It refers to an evolutionary estagnation.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust.
That the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: how to adhere?
21st century.
Is it human beings?
Nothing less than that finds the unfold.
In the future.
From new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Give didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being.
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, when it's coming.
Someone prohibited the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
To talk about the mystery of the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
Potentially.
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking.
It doesn't happen from a story we tell.
Betinho has learned us for more than 30 years.
This story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was incendiated.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flow.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
I was playing in the middle of the fire, and I got back with patience.
The worms...
"Yeah."
Little things...
I'd play in the middle of the man, "One man fleeing, seeing that," she said more, or "Go a flower?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
Little things?
Are you going to turn off this infernal fire?
I leave the flower and say, "I know I don't."
Let's talk about everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little ...
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions...
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
Can I do it with others?
Comundo and resistant.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
who studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a vulgant rat.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he is part of him.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
All of us who are necessary?
All of us.
At some point you'll be here, what you're on this stage.
But on stage...
You have your life story.
Telling your story.
and taking them back ...
Your drop had water, because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Once again, it's complaining.
from darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
Time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Love is compassive and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with the poem.
It's accessible.
Dear.
Renevant.
I went to Renato in Tedesco.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed my eyes, they had seen you.
They created others.
For other visions.
Both arms that had this remote.
To be forgotten.
It's cold.
It's always the same.
Always.
No.
But simple.
Alone.
Always.
Longe.
And inside.
That's it.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I entered a good school.
Decória.
I got good grades.
Choice is a job that will define you for the rest of your life while it's still a child.
And I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a maker.
Since my mother has reality.
I choose a university of resignation, of public preference.
(Laughter) I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
I was a multinational company that didn't recognize me by their family.
Whether "trainee," she works 12 hours per diapers, up to the limit of her strength.
Sharing the obvious, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
Do interactive meetings, video games that wouldn't take to any place.
show that you are important for the structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
(Laughter) I found someone, car with six reflexes.
Namoro, relief, wedding.
He's mini opponent.
Scale the corporate pyramid.
He sees on his shirt, samba-boats.
A lot of job.
Be a manager.
The firm's car.
"They want the freel at an hour marked." (Laughter)
We'll have bad cuts and sapatenis.
Take the shirt.
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son is to hear each other.
(Laughter) Trop your car year, no year.
She bought an apartment and holds 180 contractions.
That first case, this conjugation, with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter) I say, right?
Two years later, all of seven days per Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami... (Laughter) more meetings that don't take somewhere.
People completely unqualified being promoted before you.
Projects that start and devastate like their desires.
The continuous feeling of change the teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken.
He sees the shirt.
(Laughter) The first apartment on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle school crisis, the meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years, went fast, is, life is short.
Audience: Yes.
Children in school, my God, how to grow fast, is short life.
(Applause)
We'll have very cut in halluces, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we are going to sell the beach apartment, children grew up and don't even want to go further, to see the shirt.
The external thing is a little high, its fluid body, like an astronaut here has spent years fighting in zero gravity.
No face and because of the healthy habit of going through the entrance film, I place all the infections.
Lut it out, cold lactose, jucovered, semestal plan of the academy you used for two months, today is fourth, days of beanchada, liver hamburgers, after staying late at the firm, to close a project, because life is too short to eat easy.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing jobs, today, don't appreciate any more experience.
The fear of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
The continuous fear that prevents you from living.
The complete disconnection with its decorative children from the 12 hours of work for decades.
The empty retirement, surrounded by useless and unhappy things.
You're a winner, this is your only consensus.
His life as an executive executive.
(Applause) Thank you for a shirt, wood, for the real time.
(Applause) (Music)
