Have you ever thought what people with disabilities is like?
If there's any difference?
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dressed room that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue bother me so much?
Everything started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
And then, these things remained in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including squares that were in Porto Alegre in that occasion.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times they would buy clothes, "Um."
Two larger numbers, they took the sewage to make some pieces of objects, and that made them lose the cake of the play.
They were happy that they lost a lot of time and they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist, was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I made her a threat with a very high cause, the elastic of the blind to make more comfort.
I made a hyper-descret for her to change the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, there was no sewing and no take-up so they wouldn't be shaped by the skin actress with some surface, and I obviously didn't put their backpacks on their shoulders because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a whitele that had opened on its shoulders.
With the closing of pressure button, to make it easier when it comes to mind.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a dressed room that facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic, who gives autonomy, to be able to dress alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women, with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
By the way, the ideal, as a size, would always be to think of making blogs and labelettes in arms so people could have access to some basic and color information.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
What about women with low-scale anism?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
Why don't they need to find ideal clothes anymore?
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and color.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me about my work is that I read with these people's self-esteem, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, more than 45 million people have a disability, what does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs.
Are you ready?
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world that is already in the décima edition?
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Little brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
That the big companies, famous and designed brands, who realized the real need of this dressed room, and are already launching inclusive collections due to the size of success that was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
What about the world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
So, I tried to talk to the children, I saw that today, when I'm in the community, I reach people, and I'm very happy, so I tried to replicate my house, I met a plant called her Hengra, we have a plant with a plant, and today, I have a lot of poison, a lot of toxic, so I'm planting myself with what's all in my son, and today I have a dam, and I have to go where I'm going to move where I'm observing, when I'm here, when I'm here, when I'm here, my family, a little, when we have a little, my community, and I have a little of noise, my community, and I have a little of noise, and I have a little of sound, and a little of my community,
I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California, "Wait these children, they're very proud.
From my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream, in reality, and create this family.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
Imagine all the most and parents who are here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
And we had two options: we could confuse, cry, or solve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and keep looking for an optical melody to find it.
Then, it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the friends, made all a huge movement, sharing the press, social media, gave us a very important message for all of us, the first one for us, and then for all the rest of the world, so that he could make a fear transplant.
That when a child bounces you and has a risk of life, all or the rest of fears, worries, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and that's what we learn to be this lesson and spread to our friends, to the school's more, to society, people on Facebook, talking about the truth, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
The second message he had with this disease, publicly, and all this movement of thought was donor, was that people saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
AC: It's not a family that loves each other, that embraces each other, that's the same as all these families, because, deep down, it doesn't matter we are two men or two women, or a mother divorced warrior, or importantly, I love the family, this unity, this that gives the strength, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranceno passed through this disease to the world, "What?"
My blood, my mulla oil, we can manufacture them, the healthy blood, I'm a human being able to donate to another human being, so he raised that consciousness, our factory.
For someone who has a house, don't go out, blood is necessary in parts, when we have an accident, at any moment, everyone is processing and need it.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a patient's donor, it's about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you win the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I caught myself Ah, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to save in life, if me, but strength, being an animator, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's only the most beautiful thing and the message that ... or so big ...
Or to support us by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
It's called Laikon.
You looked at it.
The base is like you.
This is exalition.
Two there.
My name is "Pala-La del Tinaü."
Her Syrian was born in Damasco.
Capited from Syria.
In January, I studied at Damasco University.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not Brazil with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Arabic is a little ...
In front of the Portuguese.
(Laughter) That's why.
This is excuse.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brocity that exerces Slam."
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with this.
A "X" of the war.
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population was over 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child.
Three, two, already cut down.
I'm an Engineering writer.
Two apartments.
I have a car in Damasca.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15, 2011.
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all the other cities in the country.
My masco city was the safer of Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
Good, in five years of war, man and the country is destroyed.
People I know were forced to carry on or left their children.
They found their injured smooths mutilated by a bomb, family members, disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, my family would come back again.
Or not?
Today, millions of Syrian are dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, our mind and our life remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
After ten months, about Brazil having opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk to the Brazilian ambassad and say that São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why had more opportunities?
And I had only one week to leave behind 40 years of my life.
It's starting again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, the food that my good friends told me to celebrate my children's birthday, in Brazil, and everyone said very well, two or 11-year-old children, I enjoyed that she cooks very well.
And making food to sell, that's when I created Bagina on Facebook, the Talal with Syria Idea, that's why now everything has pen and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) is the Talion of Syrian food.
(English) I make food and I deliver Tibor WhatsApp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you, or a journalist told me, "I, after it happened in France, now and I don't want to talk, or to talk, I think slam likes blood.
It's being allowed to tie the name of religion, but exactly the pocket.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French, but also Branus or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image or a basic religion.
I'm not a sacred book since a person in which she had killed all men and read about life, whether she gave birth to all men in the courtyard, in her life, in the dark 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, I don't understand any type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like culture and religion differences.
When people see a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that covered hair, just like my wife, they ask questions like this.
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home as well?
Alindy Jabi or islam has other rules.
Men and women can't touch each other, hug, and kiss, some people tell me, but I've already seen some humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Let's see, Islam has these rules, more than each person wants to buy or not.
The "deblata bem" prohibits some things to be the same way the states that don't obey everything.
It's not good that I didn't put myself as a battle of fat into alcohol drinks.
When I left the arsang in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I'd drink alcohol or had sex with more than a partner.
This isn't happening with me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because these things are forgotten of isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, in spite of not knowing Moislam, after the Exibic Agency, people always understand and respect.
Profeita Mohamádez, that we must respect all religions, that everyone has the same value.
That we should be true with all of us.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black, or Indians, or that affects us well that we should help the people who need it.
Every year we have Alsaacá and we give two dots five percent of our money for the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if the poor humans are crystalls or cordels, and I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was something to be and to understand that it's a basic privilege.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil, the world knows better Islam.
To finish with the "Obrecent."
Make my children.
And your children.
Balbuder to grow together based.
What is the molecule?
AC: In the shortest histories of life, I come to recite my tears, in the Sun born in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up the roots of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe, soon I lose hope, but in the daily bucket I know who suffers: "The bag is food," my salary ends, just like this race, and the girl says to me, "I'm here, I don't get the opportunity to work, there was a lot of money, a cooker."
Faxineira: Why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, he gave me an opportunity, and the mum said to me, "You follow this corridor, you'll jump, turn on the left, enter that little side, that the vessor is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, the page I created on Facebook, it wasn't even completed four months. This year, she wasn't programmed yet, I was at home, I said about the website, I've got a maid, and, as I use Facebook, like the newspaper, I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, almost in front of me.
I put everything on the internet, I had to bring the yesterday, I couldn't use the glass in the city of Santos, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid for seven years, that, in 2009; and my boss prevented me from feeding myself from the same food I did so that this case, other people had gone through this, I did, and even the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and then I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared it.
This first story on the internet went viral very quickly, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed many media, both the international media, the national media, London's tons, the German TV Dábio and many others, which all of us.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive advertising advertisers, which I titled as abuse announces, domestications are more valued, they earn for an hour, so completely different here in our country, for example, an announcement I read.
I was nervous, maybe brave, I started to cry, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I always liked reading, but, even today, books are very expensive, there were several oppressions stories. However, in a single house I found something that I call humanized treatment, Regina.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing the experiences I'd been through in the past, I was very nervous, and then she started to spread several texts to study, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I was a kid I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world," and then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing, and it was very difficult."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, and I spon some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy," yes, today I came here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, right?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil, and 79% are of domestic, my grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood that, and I started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me at least an interview, they were suspicious, and after graduation, they took suits to see my experiences, to have established this, that and so on, and so on?
Yes, or I'm magical ... (Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that the biggest house in the past are domestic slaves in the past, and it's a not that distant past, it's very low to us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern age.
It's the maid's petitd.
So, if I'm going to clean the room, he'll work, then she arrives and says, "Imina, it was so short, ours, my girl, I created, since I was little, with so much ze and care, her mother was always going to work, there wasn't much time for her, because modern senzala is the coast of the employee, and it hit me a sadness, and when I arrived, running, the tape, and I kept waiting a lot of time for her to come, if she was a payment store.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and so I can flee from his spots, because when I spoke to my boss I worked, my friends say, "Menina, stay, you get 18 Brazilian reals per month, you'll never get this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my kids in Northeast, and they need this money, because when I say I'm going to change employment, I couldn't use my pot of soup.
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a maid too, your mother wasn't a maid too, she's already predestined for your family to serve."
So, you have to be happy, to be come, so I'm here, counterparticans, statistics: black, fat woman ... (Applause)
(Applause) Woman arrested, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
(Applause) I've ended up with 6 million houses, who should be here next to me, and at some point they'll be everything I do.
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
But just to see that six million houses are being represented now, because in other countries, various households, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, because, in other countries, various patterns, various patterns, and some domestications, and I'm talking about six million houses.
They're from African foundings and not mandated.
And I'm going to ask you, if you stay in photography with my fear, I'm here today to talk about silencing, until I'm dying of fear, out, but the only way of communicating is speaking, until I'm dying of fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you, what is silence for us, human beings?
I was shaped at a table in a surgical center, and then the pain didn't stop... If you don't allow yourself to look at you in the silence of your head, emotionally, and then he turned to me and said, "Fluxisco, you'll never know who it is, in fact, let's continue.
When I put my foot inside, guys, and then, in the midst of this chaos, everything I've experienced, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of this story that I've found, he said, "It's a human being, the way I dealt, and you're not the entrance door to a present state, and it was very scared, and I found out that I wasn't sure I't going from the agenda.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cellphone, I remember that all of you have, most of you, others justified his importance, thinking only stood the man, don't need to.
Listen to me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
And you who were noticing notebooks, closing your notebooks for a moment, turn off your cell phones, put your cell phones on the floor, (Laughter) put your bags, the floor, turn this step off.
Now, look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left: look at the ceiling, look at the later walls, look at me, you took it near you the tool, look at the ceiling, look at the stage, you're fine, earned to a neighbor.
He was connected, guys.
See your eyes, break your legs, see where you are, you see, close your eyes.
Close your hands, close your eyes, put your hands in your legs, your knees.
Now, with your eyes closed, anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, until this guy is now with much more fear than all of you together.
It's a real fear, a fear of what's inside of us, of closed eyes.
Take this step with me.
Remember where you are, remember the walls, remember the ceiling, remember the dimensions closer to salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, in Latin America, locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting a natural and subused system of the human brain, we're connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong sense of direction, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
At that moment, a different part of your mind is waking up, knowing where you are, and leaving the space localization system, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
You remember, when you were children, you took your hand to hot chicken, to feel there's also one knowledge, now, with the connected location system, and you've learned that a little before your hand was playing Chica.
Observe.
And apply space localization system to its minimum space: the volume, the area that you occupy in this room, notice the occupied area.
And then, more than that: feel.
What fits the area that you occupy.
AS: Open your eyes.
I came here today to tell you that, much of what we do, we already know how to look inside is in silence, that you don't need to be afraid of the evolution of race, not only new, but they are technologies on the planet, it's new, as it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
What is TEDxT?
This is what usually turns the first video.
From a demand of a region of Formos Idete, who asked for translations, shared fashion, or friends, colleagues and family.
At least, it has an influence in English.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
Sete and 16 languages, and almost 6,000 translations made.
These are made in events, like these here.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment to do this?
But it's in Portuguese, first it's transcribed in animal language.
The problem is that, later, being scared for my time, and from English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
Initially?
They have such as Pedro TET technology, "Entrortingment," which is "e," that we can translate as entertainment, and go out to the stage to refer to.
Those who are thirsty or shout, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
Lucky pieces.
The theme is this auditory event.
It's that it's horrible that we have after we don't.
Contracts also reduction.
I said, "This guy, uncle."
It's to translate and want to transcribe as a pride saying in the environment for ten, which can be.
And not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that the translator is a privileged sector.
Not only delicious, sometimes I say another song.
(Laughter) Not only because I had suchatic people, as I'm getting to know right now.
"Oh, my cognitive precedent ...
(Laughter) These articles.
(Laughter) And become to what is vevery, that I don't have any pain to do.
And I also have no doubt what it is to study.
Syptium and try to commit myself.
To give the time that's left is different from the same.
and throw funds, that throw this guy.
Always, a nephew knows itself and a half that changes research, a lot of work, many hours of verticality.
And why is it a flowing translation like this, to be ours, as a kiss?
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be better.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide the reason: the majority.
Or as we call "Por un LC".
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, that we have in Portuguese Portugal, which is very different, we have ten NC, the parents I'd like to quote here in Brazil.
Very well... Audience: Oh!
I have to hear it.
which lives in a deep political crisis, right?
My father, who has been receiving for two years, if he was coming, hurt primary school, despite this, I knew very well that baby and make the four very good characteristics, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond what I had studied and do with his four children.
His place also established as a merchant, he found that the material of a presence store had a restaurant.
It has a thousand of our feelings.
All of us, literally, without giving...
My mother, who has come today for years, is João, right?
It was not to know about cooking.
She's always used an experimental dinner, my bug, and she decided to sell markets.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in a way.
A big question, without a doubt, because according to data from the penetration of national research by sampleship and domicilios.
This fascination, this passion...
And a notebook body prevents, where the prideprodozone shoot, a prize, the visite killer that appeared at home.
Today I keep thinking that this should be the biggest spectrum visited to parochia, but for my father, they would check their babies, without knowing, they were living no.
The best conditions of what we've had, and here I tell you my greatest passion in my audience's life, are my two pounds, myel, João enrique, whom I've never put this coal to have the newspaper for me, but for those I've done left.
The adventure has always been a pleasure for me and for my children, by coincidence or not, four of us, we become teachers, education is always a server, at some point in life, and one of my brothers is educator, without absolutely fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas, that it applies.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has TVJ.
That TED, just like my father works such a simple way, the secrets.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where I can feel the things that are written.
(Laughter) During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they stay how they worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols, and then they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super conveyed, I started to write the letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a replete, which is a small one that allows you to describe in Braille, in which you write that shows the retreat.
I ended up launching my notebook, and my agenda in which I wrote to her that I was learning, I gave them tips, I did that many times, and I also exchanged various letters that guilty me, film names, and, with that, in the first second year's passing, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in an interesting school.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming our teachers, we started to research, we had thousands of projects from this, we would gather one on the Internet and be ready to connect the engines, and we created a clock, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project. We decided to create a small report or a translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
AC: Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it was to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from an interest can help with the inclusion of my improvement that you want to create, with that we were committed to continue studying and researching to create an even bigger impact.
So we'd like to show a video that our aunt, besides the time in the clock, senses, and sounds, and leave the message that many things seem very simple: they weren't created yet, and, even if we, two high school students, who hadn't finished, in high school, we're according to the innovator, there's still a lot to be done to help the future.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think that in a free and consent way, with sexual relations that dance commercials, that manage their business in an autonomous way? They publish their advertisements, receive their clients in apartments, in gardens, or even in street thinkers, and that no one wants to explore them, can start not dating?
In sexual aggression of children, there's a tendency to confuse that in a situation against sexual exploitation, it's to confuse a small part, as if it were all, and even in the case of prostitution of adults that are forced, which is coherited, I also think so delicious.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, that Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, we'll give the data of the Observatory about human traffic, the research related to human traffic, most people take all the people who are in prostitution, victims, structured, who are at something that expects someone who has come to save them.
Of course, we know that not everyone has the same options, but when we talk, inequalities between rich and poor countries that do sexual work, what they say is that this is an option, a hidden option, after equation in advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly destigmatized and not recognized.
If I ask you to think what is the image that comes immediately to your mind, when you think of a person that prostitates, think.
I, Western society, and I can most of you have thought of two situations, or in any other part, there is a diversity of people, practices, positive experiences, not all people who have negative experiences, and life trajectories are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
The idea that is based on this law, which isn't prohibited to sell sex, but it's the idea of the client's criminalization, and when we think about a woman, apparently humanist, was done here in Portugal that had a bigger sex worker friend, was a study led by the shaking preservation and interviewed 20% of the total substitution of people.
(Laughter)
Another idea we have is that all people who are in sexual work are victims, people with disabilities, even countries that have a hondal figure that seems ideologically biased, even because researchers have proved that the lessons between sexual and already that are in favor of the clients criminalization, are people, and people's discourse, and those who have the right to their sexuality is a right of work.
(Laughter) If people think that for them, it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to face their economic needs.
When he runs into institutions in the action of justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice, stigma is a mark that confirms a sexual, anormal and anti-natural descent, if it can be done without violence, why do we continue to disrespect people who do this activity?
The worst offense we can drive a woman is to call a puta, and, in that sense, the puta stigma, is an instrument that is at the service of the control of feminine sexuality, it's a sort of democrate mirror that's on top of any of us, any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called a puta.
And it's also recognizing this group, as a group that has been one of the most attempted attempts of silencing over time, to end up listening to sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been, so that they don't continue to disrespect sexual creators, and I think the path is the path of human rights of all including people who make their voices don't have to do.
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we should keep disrespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex tastes.
Thank you very much.
So, because when we did it wrong, at that moment, we have an operation that requires less functional diseases, and when we got there, medical knowledge in Greece, we got someone who had a TAP study, which, at the beginning of the TAPA college, we have a bit of TAP, which, when we arrived at UNT, we have TAT knowledge, TAT knowledge, TAT, a little TAT, a little TAT time, a little TAT, a little TAT, the doctor, who has a little TAT, and when we get a TAT, and there's no TAP, and when we have a RAT.
Because if you're not going to talk to a doctor's group, because, after all, the act of the relationship aren't the doctors, some of you could raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting that you talk about the most efficient relationship, it's time for us to stop, to think that we're passive, and it's patient, passive, and we have to take our hands, for those who are talking about our cure process, and it's not like that.
So, there's no very important thing to do this, and after other years, I had a consultation, the first point, the most important thing is to make information not have a very important hospital for you to know the difference that, in that occasion, when you talk to your doctor, he was in the Amazon, you don't have to have a diploma, you don't have to have a diploma, but you don't have to have a diploma, so he doesn't have a diploma, you don't have to have a diploma, you don't have to have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you don't have a diploma, you have a diploma, you don't get a diploma, you have a diploma, you don't get a diploma, you don't have
This magic that I'm trying to say that, at that moment, the magic happened that individual without speaking language has a completely different culture of the other, he handed his soul to that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of him, which is the art of healing, at that moment we talk, I'm proud to think, it's average to assist a prostropope to embrace.
We, doctors, can try to find one more unity of our most compassionate treatment, forced, and all patients can do the case of a connection.
(Laughter) Thirty and five thousand, this number is the quantity of decisions of human beings taken by guide, two; if it gives more or less a decision to make each two seconds and the person chose a digital option to a second group, and what's interesting is that it was made with this icons magazine, it was only a digital exhibition, a digital option, and an option of computers.
I've learned a lot about this in the hotel called Economia and Computal, I think that everybody seems a contemporary context in Belgium, but, in fact, we're thinking about it from above, it's a little bigger than the types of adults in the ICU, and this made me very unpleasant because I have a series of people who want people to choose a decision, without a decision, without a company, which is better, that we want us to reach and we smell, and we smell differently because we smell in the same way, and we smell in the same decision, because I have the same decision, and I don't have the same decision, and I don't have the decision, and I have the decision I make the same decision, and I don't have the decision,
So, in those 35,000 decisions we've made, was this moment, gathering this concept, with the concept of icônios magazine, where we work with the architecture of the decision, and we're preparing technology, and even the name of this profession, which makes a drawing of cartoon architecture, that everyone will take mine, and I said, "Wait, the person, the person wants us to use a lot of cell phones, and we want us to carry the success to be the success, and to be the success of this profession, we are successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful, and we're successful,
(Laughter) When I got to know this number I wanted to talk to you, "It's a number of two students, Uber has a new functional, it's a pupa, you can share the car with other people, so someone decided I wanted to offer and I didn't want to have fire, and she called me, (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) It's a number that in Austria: "Austria" - I was putting some options, I was putting the cup, I was putting Uber, and I wasn't wearing fire, I didn't have an opportunity, I didn't have anything, I didn't have anything to get out of my cellphone, I didn't have anything.
(Laughter) So Marx Florian is very complicated, and it's very interesting that we imagine who makes these decisions: if we go to Google, it's Ubertando a little more intimate to us, I love Jessé, I see there's the first Google page, and after that there's a theory, 91% of people have a name in the behavioral economy, and the funny was that a person was with my talk, and said, "When" - (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So, it's an Arabic concept.
(Laughter) In this talk, I wanted to take a picture of me, cutting the ice ... (Laughter) It's not really true.
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of life here, more than 400 inscribed people, in the midst of a text, to understand how people behave, knowledge is a tool, or you can use to make a diabetic patient know the right moment and also sublinate, (Laughter) and my answer is that, for example, if you don't want to receive an email, to get out of a person, or you can use for the middle, for the danger, for the middle, to eyel, for the good.
So, from those 35,000 decisions, we will be able to build a better world, and I believe that, as these little troubles work, we are increasingly immersed in this world of augmented reality, virtual reality, learning of machine, what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, so that we take better decisions, thank you.
