Have you ever thought about it?
How is the costume of disabled people?
If there's any difference.
Or if I should have my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a dressed room that embraces everyone.
Common people?
And without a disability?
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue bother me so much?
Everything started in 2009, when I was still searching for a theme for my final course work.
And one day ...
A kid went through a wheelchair for me.
It was there, at that moment, for the first time in my life, that I started to think about the subject.
How does it dress?
Is there any difficulty putting clothes?
Does anyone need help?
Or is it that?
Is there any interest in fashion?
What about it?
These things remained in my mind.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the dressed room for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to various women, including to parapletas that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them were interested in fashion.
However, almost all of them had trouble finding a college entrance exam that supported their needs.
So, many times they would buy clothes, "Um."
Two larger numbers, they took the sewage to make some pieces of objects, and that made them lose the cake of the play.
Now that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they really liked, because they knew that it wouldn't be fine in their bodies.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion that I arrived ...
It's that this college entrance was really necessary.
And my purpose, as a stylist, was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I made was to Juliana.
It was from one, a misfortune with other women with no disabilities.
And I made her a threat with a very high cause, the elastic of the blind to make more comfort.
I made a hyper-descret to make her exchange for the probe, which is very used because she uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the entrance exam from this piece.
And on the back, I didn't have any sewing and no support to form snakes that were wounded caused by the skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put my bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other defile, I invited women with several types of disabilities to undo others with no disabilities.
And I made Carlena a whitele that had opened on its shoulders.
With closing, with a button of pressure, to make it easier when it comes to mind.
By the way?
For people who are quadriplegic, the ideal is to think of a locker who facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic, who gives autonomy to the person to dress themselves alone.
In this last fashion I did, I invited men, women with no disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a skirt.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to make more comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I made a dress that she could wear from many ways, from top to bottom, up to top, reversible, and I wrote his name to remember him.
For her to identify that the play would be that one used on the defile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think of making funds and labelets in brains, so people could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the play.
Kelle's roots are narrow.
What about women with low-scale anism?
The ideal.
It's thinking about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find ideal clothes anymore.
Children's birth of the stores.
Imagine clothes with reasons of princess and corder rosa.
It looks like a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read with the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very rewarding.
In Brazil, there is.
More than 45 million people with disabilities.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to IBGE data, 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs.
Are you ready?
Materials lighter and more technological.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first inclusive fashion competition in the world that is already in the décima edition?
I took part in the third and took a party dress to Juliana.
And I took the second place.
I?
Silvana.
A "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
I stayed in marks.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
That the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who realized the real need of this dressed room.
They are already launching inclusive collections, such as the American woman, who was already in her second inclusive collection due to the size of success which was the first.
Target, also American, recently released an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
Fashion is also changing together.
Today ...
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion, because I need to pay attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we'll all be equal with our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
My family always came from the rock, my life, in the middle of the forest, went to live with the animals, I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
And my biggest focus was to work with the child, and I started bringing people into practice, collecting trash, knowing how to separate one trash from the other, so I tried to talk to the children, and it was making awareness from the parents, and I do with the children I know.
In my community, we have a collection of seeds, when we go to the forest, it's a leguminous plant to work with this affection, we have a plant where we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil quickly.
So, I tried to imitate the forest, because there in a group, I found out that all plants were used in our community, but I tried to imitate as an immense forest, there was a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more plant.
And there in our forest, I saw there was no plague, so I tried to plant them variating, there to have a hoa, cup, a label, a label, a lagar, a hood, a wedding, Guaraná, and everything there is no plague, like an animal.
The child, I compare her and count only to pay, you talk, she's there listening, and then passing to other children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge, we have to be patient, we have to show love, the greatest care for those children, and it was putting everything in the army, my father says, "The first lesson we have to pass by someone has to come from us."
So, I'm a person who always goes where I go, I keep observing, I'm a person who observes my house, I kept observing my house ...
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, it's very funny. So, I saw that all this with my work that was doing with children, had a future, it would work out, and today we have...
(Laughter) With a job inside, with those who are far from the atom.
The atom's statickelon, when I started there, we started with 1,000 children, for those who don't know what's far from the atom, it's the tartaruga of the Amazon.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're giving 25,000 children.
And we are reproducing the river, which before had a hooligan in front of us, above the little of our community, and that hooligan she crossed and ended the river.
And today we have the people who saw it.
Today, in our situation, a very happy situation in which we are able to live with nature, understand nature, and I always liked forests.
So, I went by with people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's ... we breathe a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest, is always talking to people educating children.
And, passing through the other people.
And I have a message to leave you with a phrase that she's very small, that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people arrive and approach us, we're talking, awareness people, and I'm very happy.
(Laughter) I'm like this, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I feel guilty, absorbed and thank you very much for your album.
I'm gay.
And marrying with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
I wish these children, they're very proud.
From my family and very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream, in reality, and create this family.
Two months ago our son Tancrède, or more than 11 years ago, was diagnosed with a melody and a leucemia.
(Laughter) This puts risk life.
Imagine all the most blind people here, as we feel, as fear of losing our child.
And we had two options.
Our foundation, crying, or solving, fighting, believing, faith, strength, and continuing looking for an optical melody, to think.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, and it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all over the place, bringing people, donating medication, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another ancestor, through this disease, transmitted us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message?
It was.
That when a child alucemates you and tries to live, all or rest problems of fears, of worries, don't matter.
Besides that, there is no relevance, it really matters, and that's why we learned this lesson and spread it to our friends, to the school's more, to society, Facebook people, talking about it, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore, or more important is life, the fight for life and for love.
(Laughter) The second message he had with this disease, publicly, and all this movement found a donor.
People saw us as a family.
Heterossexual, parental man.
It's a family that loves, that embraces, that's the same as all these families, because it's not in the background.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a warmer divorce, or important, I love the family, this union, this that gives strength, this that gives life, this that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that Tranceno passed through this disease to the world, "What?"
My blood, my idle medule, was to make them our factory.
The blood only gets sick.
I'm a human being able to donate to another human, so if he raised this awareness, we have this ability to donate blood so he needs, and you know it's not just that?
For someone with cancer, blood, blood, if necessary in the couples, when we have an accident, at any moment, they all ecosystem and need it.
And to donate "setting ugly," if each "strar" as the donor of "mella ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a donor and a patient, it's about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you win the mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I caught myself Ah, it was a very beautiful moment of power, waiting for them to call me to save in life, if me, more strength, without any pain, I am donating a part of me, to be able to save in life, and it's just the thing.
By supporting us, by this union that we are not feeling this unconditioned support, not only to save Tankède's life, but to be aware that we can't all donate blood and donate mulla to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you very much.
It's called Laikon.
You looked at it.
The base is like you.
This is exalition.
That's not it.
My name is "Pala-La del Tinaü."
Her Syrian was born in Damasco.
The capital of Syria.
In January.
I studied at Damaspo's University.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not Brazil with my family.
My mother is Arabic.
Araly is a little ...
In front of the Portuguese.
That's why.
This is excuse.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I'm talking.
Today, I'll talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brocity that exerces Slam."
Because of terrorist groups.
that has nothing to do with this.
A “X of war.”
Syria was beautiful.
Tranquila.
Tarata.
It's easy to live.
The population ...
It was 23 million people.
I had ...
My family.
My friends I knew about this child.
Three, two, already cut down.
I'm an Engineering writer.
Two apartments.
I, a car.
In Damasscoa.
I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started on March 15.
It was in 2011.
Interesting.
Later.
I arrive to all the other cities in the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
There were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Origia.
Good, it's five years of war, man and the country is this one.
Strol.
People: whom I know were forced to charge or left their children.
They found their injured smooths mutilated by a bomb, family members, disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years, in Syria, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it's going back home, when I left to work, my family would come back again.
Or not?
Today.
Millions of Syrian lost everything, they were dead or refugeed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, our mind and our life remained behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country, my father and my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
to protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
After, ten months.
Obviously, Brazil had opened doors for the Syrian.
So I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassad and say that São Paulo was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why?
I had more opportunities.
And the Tevia Pinas, or a week, to leave brains.
Fifty years of my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and I was very much, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months ago.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate, my children's birthday, and they all said very well, the food my good friends talked about, I enjoyed it was the kitchen very well.
It's making food to sell.
Hi, who I created the Facebook page, "Hotalade with Syria Idea," that's why now, everything has paper and paper, but the number ... (Laughter) I was there Syrian committed.
I make food and I deliver.
Even Boro Whatsapp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world is.
It was closed, Branus, Etress, who, because of the war and terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, or a journalist tells me, "I, after this happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk, or talk, or contact with a Muslim person."
A lot!
That Islam loves blood.
It is allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More also white, or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is replacing Islam's image.
A basic religion.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since a person who had killed all men and who read about life, is it like life unleashes all men to the courty, in his life, in the dark, 32?
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, lonely, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When those of her came, a woman using Ri Jabi, that handkerchief that covered my hair, just like my wife, was my wife.
Do you ask questions like?
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home as well?
(English) "Aline de Reijabi."
Today, read other rules.
Men and women cannot touch each other, hug, kiss, sex, only voice, wedding.
Some people told me.
But I've already seen humans who do all this.
That beat is the hug.
Look, Tao Slam has these rules, more than each person wants to buy or not.
The debate well proves some things to be the same way the states that don't obey everything.
It's not good not being killed as a pork can and alcohol drinks.
When I left the arsang in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I had alcohol.
Let's do it.
With more than a partner.
This didn't happen to me.
Why?
Because these things are forgotten of isolation.
Our religion is very important for ours.
But, in spite of not knowing Moislam, after the Exibic Agency, people always understand.
It's respect.
Profeita Mohamádez, that we must respect all religions.
That everyone has the same value.
What should we have?
Beautiful.
With all of us.
It doesn't matter if they're white, black or Indians.
Oislam also says that we should help the people who need.
Every year we have Alsaacá and we give two dots, five percent.
All of our money for the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if the poor are glasses or jodes.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was something to be and to understand that it's a basic privilege.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil, the world knows better Islam.
To finish with the "Obrecent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
It's your children.
Valuing, growing.
Together with base.
What is the molecular shake?
PC: In small stories of life.
I come to recite my tears, in the sun ships in saints, they prepare me to take a shower, always ready to not give up to the roles of those who always expect to reach.
Those who always believe cancer, I don't believe, soon I lose hope, but, in the daily bucket, I know who suffers, "The strength makes food," my salary ends, just like this race, I study the girl, it's what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Fascinira.
Why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand this, if you pay me so much to pay a secretary course, but you don't even enter the office, or for excuse, do an event here, to clean everything and wash the bathroom?
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also leave, and I, here, in the same situation.
Then ME is CTI, be a maid, if it was for option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas: please, I gave myself an opportunity, and the teacher told me, "You follow this corridor, you'll right, you'll be left, enter that little room, that the vassoura is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about Facebook, it wasn't yet programmed, I was at home, access to the website, I used a maid.
I started running from day to day, sometimes there's no time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life, so I took that day in the middle of my running life, and I stayed there in the couch remembering all that I've accomplished, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live on the beach, almost in front of the beach, and how I use Facebook, like the diary?
I put everything that happens, my mother up to me, and Lili, everything can be done on Facebook, tomorrow is my new diary, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid for seven years, so that, in case, other people have gone through this, they compassionate, and so I can keep following that everyone wrote, always talking in the past.
Then, soon afterwards, I put my first story on the Internet, I had to bring the yesterday, I couldn't use her cup in her house, nor the bathroom.
At her house.
I had the bathroom for houses.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And that, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I shared it.
This first story on the internet went viral very quickly, and then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only stories of the past and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories, I interviewed several media, the international media, and the national media.
It must be from London, the German TV Dábio and many others, which I was super surprised when I spoke to these reporters on Skype than everyone.
Everyone!
All of them got very excited when I started talking about the housing situation in Brazil.
And then they were able to break and I started to talk about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the domestications are more valued, they earn for an hour, so completely different from our country.
It was for workers and work in a second, nurture.
This became a daily practice, so what I did when I got home, gathered all the speed, there were domestications, going through these conditions still today, there are domestic practices, but in only one house, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a room where I found something I call humanized treatment, which is Regina, a month, and soon in the room.
I was nervous, maybe brave, and I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and knowing the experiences I'd already experienced in the past, and then she started to meditate several texts to study, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a history teacher, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world." Then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing, I was very hard."
To facilitate the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and to those who think I was the first to talk about these issues about raising the typical of the Brazilian traditional family, and showing that slavery wasn't yet over.
There are women working in analog situations of slavery, I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman named Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some reports, and people say, "Wow, it's really heavy," yes, today I came here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe that only through the adversity that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone, why?
Most domestic workers in Brazil, 79 victims are 6% agreed with the deese of 2013, they are black women.
And this can't be the only condition for black women.
This place is a job like any of us, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil.
And 79% are of a house.
This service can't be egalitarian for black women.
Why do I say it's the hereditary service?
My grandmother.
It was a maid.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that everything she'd spent, while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I'd also spend a lot of time to understand, but she already knew that everything she'd spent, while she worked and had a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without pictures, they called me, at least, an interview, take a suspect, and this after graduation, OK?
"Yes."
Or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that the biggest house in the past are domestic slaves in the past, and it's a not that distant past, it's very low to us, it's the domestic employees today, the modern age.
It's the maid's petitd.
She ran away, hurt, and I was nervous, because I waited a long time for her to get there on Friday, and when I got there, I was already wearing the clothes to leave, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Mina, it was the maid's money.
My girl, I created, since I was little, with so much zen and care, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to marriage.
Because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the neck of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take pictures from all rooms, to hide me, so, if I'm going to clean the room, I'm blank.
If I clean the bathroom, I blank myself, and I can run away from his cassette because when I say I'm going to change employment, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you win bills a month, you'll never get this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I left my children in Northeast, and they need money, because modern senzala.
It's the maid's petitd, I just arrived at the new service, because my sailor's pot is my nickname, and then I was there, in this area of service, tight, I took my savan's pot and did this in number one, and my boss saw it, I was very scared, and said, "Why are you wearing the sovereign gate?"
It's the maid's money, today I'm here, contrary to statistics, to some people, in my place, would be there in the cleaning lady, because, when I told my boss that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Menine, you have to be happy where you are, to pay attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, but the mother wasn't a houseke too, she's already predestined to your family to come."
So, you have to be happy, to be come, so I'm here, counterparticans, statistics: black, fat woman ... (Applause)
(Applause) Woman arrested, fat, teacher, peripherical and rack.
They do here today, behind me, there are 6 million houses who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do?
I'd run away without thinking about money we don't have money.
We'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, but only to see that six million households are being represented now, because in other countries various domestications, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country, so I'm here, it would be in the statistics, I'm not talking about six million houses.
They're from African branches, unforgettable.
I'm here today to talk about silencing.
What's already a bit funny, exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
You turn off your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Even because I'm dying and fear.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll still be more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us human beings.
To have people who say that silence is a door of the entrance for whom we are emotionally.
Because those who we are emotionally are those who we are truly.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your mind, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was dying at a table in a surgical center.
What about it?
I was doing the 8th grade, the conceptual day of my eyes.
In the stage, everything was very inflamed.
When did the acid start?
I was feeling very pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Fluxisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take it.
Let's go?
I was almost 30 years of game, and I meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Look at the agenda.
Open the agenda.
Take your eye.
And it's insecurity, with equipment, marvelous inflammation points.
The first passing through the bisturi.
Wow!
The pain went to the next level and I was sure that I wasn't going to realize.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this situation's chaos?
I remembered an author's quote, he spoke like this.
Silencing is the entrance door to the state of presence.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
From this feeling, from this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not an anxious preciation of what you have in front of you.
human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have a belief, you don't have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my foot inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Very scary.
It was very angry.
And that's in cure.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found various emotions, various emotions, that I didn't know they lived big from me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From all I had experienced.
What about it?
The discovery was gone.
Everything I'd already lived.
It was.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining how I perceived life.
It's determining my choices.
Now, recently, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
He just stood the man.
Several of you.
Did you think?
No, I don't need it.
Others justified the importance of it.
So now, I really want to challenge each one of you to pick up your cell phone, pick up because all of you have.
Listen to me: you all have a cell phone.
Turn it off.
(Laughter) Turn off, come this step.
It's not close to you to turn off.
Turn off your cell phones?
(Laughter) Put your bags, the floor, put your cell phones on the floor.
(Laughter) So, back then, you close your computer.
You, with the laws connected, close them, and you who were noticing notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed, you're not disconnected, you've got close to you: the tool.
It stern of connection: who connects with the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look at the stage.
Then look at the other human being that you have on the right and on the left.
"No, I'll look at her in the man's face."
You're good, you got even a little kiss.
(Laughter) He was connected, guys.
"Yeah, people."
Do you see where you are?
You wait.
(Sigh) You see, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, break your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, knees.
Now, close eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that's born of fear.
No friends.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, because this guy, right now, has much more fear than all of you together.
It's real fear.
A fear of what's inside you.
I look at this emotional map of the life story.
with eyes closed.
Take this step with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember these dimensions closer to the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
A south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At that moment, we are connecting.
A natural and subused system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space localization system.
In the space localization system, even if you think you don't have a strong direct center, there's a knowledge: you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At this moment, a piece of something different from your mind is caring.
Do you know where you are and letting the localization system connect?
Feel where you are, feel your chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, did you take your hand to hot chicken?
And soon you learned that a little before your hand you play Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to Asa da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, it's connected to the localization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
At its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy in this room.
They see the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
"Sintate."
Which brings the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
Novo, it's just new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, as it's new.
Equality: it's new, since it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you who you are.
Look inside, explore silence.
Then you realize.
That much of what we do is given to what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's to have real freedom of choice.
Silencing and a state of presence that decorates from it and can become.
A habit in our lives are self-awareness technologies.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available, they're simple, but they're technology of...
Great generation.
We already know that, in the future, it's evolution of race.
Communication will be the direct unit between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection actually happens when you communicate authenticity to another authentity: silence is a source of freedom.
What is TEDxT?
This is what usually turns the first video.
From a demand of a region of Formos Idete, that asked other societies.
My friends, your colleagues, your family.
At least, it has an influence in English.
Hope for millions of Brazilians.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
Sete and 16 languages, and almost 6,000 translations made.
These are made in events, like these here.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment to do this?
But it's in Portuguese, first it's transcribed in animal language.
To then be verified for me, instead, and in English, it's that it's translated to do more languages.
And, initially?
They have as TED technology: "Entrortinment," which is "e," that we can translate as a fun.
And do you get out?
Those who come back from sectors or shouts, politics, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
Species that come back at times of chance.
The theme is this auditory event.
It's that it's horrible that we have after we don't.
Contracts also reduction.
I said, "This video is about 20 Brazilian reals."
It's to translate and realize how I look.
Think about the TEDx environment.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that the translator is a privileged sector.
Not only delicious, sometimes I say another song.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I know now.
Because I think it's worth using my cognitive accident.
In initiatives like this one.
(Laughter) And become what is vevertially, that I have no doubts about education.
And I also have no doubts about studying.
Because I've always my choice, my decision.
And there are people to engage me.
Doing the time it stays?
It's different from donating.
And it transforms sources with xinga chora.
A part of permission knowledge.
Many research, many jobs, many hours of verticalization.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent, to be ours, of fear.
The best they can do us, it can always do in the best.
Because the text can be 1,000 million.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we're going, the majority of us.
Or as we call "C."
In Brazil's case, in Brazilian Portuguese, where we created Portuguese Portugal, which is very different, we have ten NC, the parents I'd like to quote here in Brazil.
Very well ... (Audience) Aaah!
In fact, she has to hear.
which lives in a deep political crisis, right?
My father, who would have been two years now, if he had been said, didn't take the primary school course.
Nevertheless, I knew this baby very well and did the four mathematics operations, and their dream was always able this.
And to make the children feel that's why he was living in our neighbor called "Tai obedras."
In some places, my father had sold his logic to Uberas and his place had established, too, with the merchant, he had a small material from a presence store that had invested before.
In 1968.
He stayed, literally, without any years when you killed your old furniture.
And he felt very humiliated from his economic practice, and my father decided.
My mother, who has been here for years now, is helping me, right?
It was not to know about cooking.
training centuries, my hand, and she decided to do "consects" to sell.
So, although we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress in something my father didn't open our hand, it was that we had to overcome studying.
And that's how it works.
The big one, without a doubt, because I already run away from the penis of national research by Agassa and domicilios.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion my father had in education, transparently.
And a notebook body prevents, where the printed pitch, the purchase, and then any visibility arrives at home.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest spantalized in parochia, right?
But for my father, they made me laugh babies, without knowing, they were having my hand.
The best conditions of what we've had, and here I tell you my greatest passion in my audience's life, are my two pounds, myel, João Inlique, whom I've never put this coal to have the newspaper for me, but for those I've done left.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and a fact.
Coincident that, in coincidence or not, four of us, my brothers, we became teachers, education is being an accident at some point in life, and one of my brothers is the educator without absolutely fantastic, creative, revolutionary ideas that he applies.
So, the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do.
We see in our country education has to be a priority inside it.
And my passion with initiatives is TED has Jupiter TV.
That TED, just like my father functions the very simple way, the written.
What makes us believe here?
Despite everything.
AC: Our aunt, our voice, is blind, and it was with her that I had in our first contact with the army, an alphabet where I can feel the things that are written.
(Laughter) During the vacation, we went one afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers and symbols, and they tried to teach us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super conveyed, I started to be messed in some classes and decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing letters from dots of my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left to buy a ticket, which is a little girl that allows you to write in Braille, in which you write that shows the relief.
I ended up touching my notebook.
And my agenda?
Letters of music, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged various letters that inspired me.
When I wrote to her that I was learning, I gave tips, and, with that, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course at Colégio Santa Cruz.
We thought that maybe the braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the schedule.
We started researching, we had thousands of processes of this, we would gather one on the Internet, and we would be ready to connect with the engines, and we would have a clock, but saw that there was no Internet, we had to decide what is our own, we started researching about robotics and programming our teachers and trying to create the clock.
So we picked the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the engines, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille so you can feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shaked and nothing happened, but we did writing everything, disconnected and reconect everything and started to work, and, about a month ago, we ended the clock and showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to try to make a small report or a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
Every process we went through knew a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from an interest, can help with your aunt's inclusion and potentially many other people, that showed us how much it is not necessary to have a revolutionary idea, but important is to have a vision of my besty that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching, to create an even bigger impact.
So we wanted to show a video that our aunt, besides the time in the clock, the senses, the sounds, and leave the message that many things seem very simple: they weren't created yet, and, if we, two students from high school, who hadn't even finished, in high school, we are second, and we are teenagers, we can create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help this.
Let me ask you a question, "What do you think?"
There are adult people.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have other adult people, they can put the manual.
OK, we're all agree, two or more adults, free and consent, can have sexual relations.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is an expression that is professional, the only difference or the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercials is that it's a trade in half, that is, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the objective to have profit and another part with the objective of having pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their advertisers, receive their clients in apartments, hotels, or have street thinkers.
And don't have anyone to explore them.
And in good talk about cases, what's involved is what I'm here to talk about.
Children?
Scasses that involve us from 16 or adults who didn't make sense that their consent is crime cases, they are cases that must be chosen criminally and delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adulthood that is forced, which is also coherent, I think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, it's always a stunning situation by volunteer and forced prostitution.
And it also doesn't come to talk about situations of trafficking for sexual action: "The tendency is to confuse that, in a case, against sexual exploitation is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
And to give you an idea of what I just said, that Campo de Calfenome isn't possible, I'll give you the data of the Observatory about human traffic, which is the state organism that can Portugal gather information about the issues related to human traffic, and, relatively in 2016, there are phenomena that don't identify but can cross victims for sexual structure.
There are only three.
Of course, you'll be listening to a single victim.
to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole email speech that is unpleasant from reality.
In other words, there's an image outside, there are many stereotypes related to prostitution.
MP: But, many times, people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims, defeats, tortured, who are something that expects someone to save them.
But this doesn't respond to reality either, or it's just another stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider it a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair to structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate economic inequalities, socio-ecultural inequalities, that is, we know that there is a diversity of construction that influences the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I meet a researcher, interview, I'm with people who do sex work, what they say is that it will be an option, as a pundered option, after equation in advantages and disadvantages, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but highly witnessed and isn't recognized.
Audience: Yes.
Audience: Yes.
If I ask you to think what is the image you see immediately in your mind when you think of a person that prostituates.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or any other one.
Or, a woman with a bad appearance and minissaia who's in a corner, in a dark street in the city, who's probably a lot of beathoxic with a relative and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But this is just two stereotypes, these are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor or reality.
There is a huge diversity of people with sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
From practices, experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative and trajectory of life.
But it's not just women.
And it's not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work and there are women transgender, not only cargender women, there are also many women with sexual work transgender, for example, when our image would be equipped when we think about prostitution from it.
Of someone on the street, I say that the studies that are powerful and flaws, and the accidental cities, and that try to stimulate the number of people who are at the beginning of sex, indicate that...
Please, Sindroa.
Because it will only represent us about 10 to 20% of the total of prostitute people.
And when we think of a woman, we're forgetting men who do sex work.
(Laughter) They're less, they're minor, but they're not an elevated intelligence, so, when the discourse does about the victim of men or depressor, they forget that there's a percentage of men who are in sexual work, and there are still studies that show us that, in other contexts, this percentage will be even higher.
Audience: Yes.
I'm going to tell you an idea that has also been very veiculated here, in Portugal, sorry.
AC: Although it may seem an idea, apparently humanistic, when we analyze, deep down, we realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sex work and that is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
From 1999.
What is not prohibited to sell sex, but there are strong evidences, namely, non-governmental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual underground, the idea that is at the base of this law and that it decreased prostitution and indicates that this law puts at greater risk their own gender wisdoms.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are.
The actions are victims.
It's a fantastic idea that, without great inspiration in ants, people's resources happened well, and this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
This is an idea that I think is ideologically biased, even because research has proved that the lessons between...
The workers of their sexes and clients are complex relationships, but there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of eliminating clients is unfortunate.
What are the people who have disabilities or people with functional diversity or other type of diversity, how is it more correct to say, and who recruit sex professionals?
Sexuality is a human right.
People with disabilities.
He has the right to his sexuality, with people who are disabled disabled, and I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that he tested in any argument that tries to be the favor of the clients criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
(Laughter) If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, their life, to face their economic needs.
(Applause)
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
He talked about work connections if this can be done.
With no more explanation than in the other workplace, why are stigmas so intense and strong about the people who do sex work, why do we keep condemnating so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we keep derespecting sex workers?
And my answer is, "Is it?
Because of moral, specifically morale, sexual, that divides sexuality into two types to the side of a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural, and Portugal we have a deaf person considered ilogitimate, anormal, anti-natural and there it is a sex commerce.
And the fact that this sex is considered ilogitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization and devalorization of people who do this activity, like, for example, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex workers is very strong for justice and social security.
And I'll say this in another way.
Now, a little, I don't know if anybody has used this word, not TEDxBas, the puta stigma is the worst that can fall down on a woman.
In other words, the worst offense we can drive to a woman is called puta.
The stigma of the bridge directed to women in two types: the honor and the disabled ones, the serious and non- seriously, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense?
The puta stigma is an instrument that is at the service of demanding a puta stigma, any woman knows that, if there is a sexual behavior that is deserved, the norms that are socially described, there is the risk of being called a puta.
So, what do I think we can do any of us can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators and I think the path is the human rights of all included based on ideological assumptions, is also?
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge stigma, as I'm here now, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempted in silence over time, sex workers are everywhere organized to use 70 but, precisely, because of stigma, their voice has no credibility, they are not ears, they haven't been told, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think is the path we have to follow.
(Laughter) Then I said everything.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense?
It's natural that we should keep derespecting, stigmatizing and criminalizing sex wisdom.
Thank you very much.
(Laughter) So why did Grécia considered winter too, in a short time, in the last ten years, when we got there, he extrapolated the last ten years, when we got there, Dão came up with the apple from SUTEC, which we got a method that has a Dript from TA, Republic, Republic, Republic, Republic, Republic, Republic of TA, Republic of TA, Republic of TA, the Republic of TA, the Republic of TA, the Republic of TA, there is a developing house, there is a new development, there is a new development,
If I respect this jury of not violating, would it be digno of having a reputation between men in all times, and if I transvest the violin as a religious secret, if I respect this jury of not violating, would it be digno to enjoy the lives of the patients?
Why, at that time, was you worried about this, and you still do a dinner?
We do judgement of things we carry on because we have to go on, because the patient's relationship is essential for a good cure, so it's today few things are taken by July of honor, in this case, I see a honor of taking part in a profession that is registered by a honoring.
The medical knowledge in Greece, an individual, that projected in a certain way, that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical team that takes care of everything, and this class is taking care of a little bit of it, we are losing the patient's cure.
There's a current theory that says, "My exam can talk for the patient, it can't."
Once I was in class in college, in class with small groups, like teachers, and I came across that you're like this: "Look, patients have aography, resonance, endospy, philosophy, ultrasonology." "Oh, I took some compostures, he called me so, called my whole class, and said, "Let's see the belly of us."
He looked at the anxiety, "Dad, as I see the patient, who's noticed I was smoking people, I didn't smoke anymore, Buraco Duzunk, to show what had emagreced, "We're mappers, it's funny, you can say a lot, "The time you're mexing in a patient, there's a moment of kindness, there's a moment of intimacy of teeth."
Besides, when you're seeing the patient, he's harming for you the vulnerable area, you're letting you move in it, at that moment, you have an opportunity to speak not verbally to him, that you're throwing him because you want to do good, then he's playing with him, be careful for you.
This relationship, this magic, isn't only beautiful of selfie, but it's replicated in science.
We don't know why it appears, there's no surgery operation, there are no blood changes, no rays, it's nothing, it's functional diseases in our environment, functional goods, but the house doesn't know why it appears, increasingly, the number of diseases that are symptoms, and this happens, "Will it happen because our society is a little ill?"
Some of you have already raised your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting for you to talk about the patient's relationship.
Because you're not going to talk to a middle group because, after all, the act of the relationship aren't the doctors, but to be a medical and patient relationship, I'm patient, and to be passive for those who are talking about this to me.
It's time for us to stop thinking that there are two habits.
My doctors against all this.
It's time for us to stop thinking that we're passive, and we have to hold our hands in our cure process, in decisions for the cure process.
To do this, the first point and most important is information.
And it's not good that the owner talked about Dr. Google, who is fashionable, when I was a child, had an ex-copes of size in Macada Medicina and Health, there was a free book of health, that this always existed.
The difference is that, at that time, to meet someone, publish something, because it's a publisher, to have content to talk, today, a Google, you have a very good and important information insinity, but many limitations a lot with it, and we need to know how to filter the capacity to generate information, it was greater than the filtrate capacity.
So, a good action usually signed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1.3% of people enter my curriculum, but know who I am.
This gives me a huge call, because people get there, hear what I have to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and it will have for nothing, that tells me, "This is wrong, because it puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money or game."
So, the signature, the second very important thing: don't believe in good things, you're not maturing this for a long time, information you run, nobody does anything alone, so there's no thing you discovered today, tomorrow is on the Internet and my most when I don't know: wilding.
Even if there's a paranoic thing, like the industry doesn't interest you to know it, and finally.
Take the information, talk to your doctor, he's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and information: knowledge, get your training, participate in your cure, but disculp your doctor.
Secondly important thing to be active in the Nación Processo de Cura is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know what that medicine serves, you have the right to know what risk in the surgery, it's no use saying, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to help me, I work for 20 years."
I know there's little time, but I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of change, the culture of existing.
Doctors want, they want the right worth, they don't want to have this attempt, like the name at the time, they want to have the car.
Audience: Yes.
Once, I was in the Amazon, in Venezuela, the opportunity to follow her opportunity to follow her pentic traffic, the Indian looked at the trampal, the doctor who obviously didn't speak so much, and I made a consultation that, to me, was a doctor who didn't speak very badly, he didn't talk so much.
This magic that has all the interest in taking care of it, that other individual, had all the interest in taking care of it. At that moment, we talked, I'm proud to think that it's average to assist a completely different culture of the other, that has handed your soul, that has apelled.
We, girls, what this is not to do, because there's a connection, we can try to find one more unity of our most compassionate treatment, seek to be active in your audience, better, and you'll be more invented, and all the patients.
(Laughter) He talked about decisions I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of making decisions every two seconds, and the respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose my grandfather to take institutions, for a second group, there is an experiment that was done with this iconos magazine, and the person chose a digital option, or 59 hours too.
I've learned a lot about this in a theory that has two options to the idea, which seems a little bigger than Civic Auto do Nano Tirei, which is the one everybody has changed, has another religious in the Olympic Union, which is what we see and differently, because I'm back of reflexes, and this made me very uncomfortable to influence the cognitive technology, and neuroscience applied to the education of the middle and the great man, and the great man, without a decision, and we can have a different way.
In the same way we see these three things, it was in this moment, gathering this concept with the concept of icônios magazine, if people were of mechanics, and we were working, they said, "Winze and there were many versions, that we have a smartphone, and in the world of technology, and even the name, to this profession, which has a way, and we wouldn't be with this profession, and we won't have any decision, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have a project, and we have
When I go ... this horizon, as it is from a person ... How many decisions we're from him and shouting power. Would we take this adhesion as I am, the ex-esistoly path to the digital to take for us, and we put Wesh?
(Laughter) (Laughter) When I got to know the number I asked, "Why in Austria?" (Laughter) It's a number that gives two to two men, which in Austria is 99% of donors and young people, which in Austria is already the worst.
You need to ask you to go out, in Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter, so there's a magic word called "Defol."
This word is what you're already, so someone decided that I wanted to offer and that I didn't want to receive the principles, and another permeceber has a new functional: you can share the car with other people, (Laughter) and here to leave, without doing anything, it's the decisions I call cardboard cardboard on birth, you need to ask to leave.
I opened Uber, I was already there already marked to get Google and tell a story, I thought it was cool to meet someone, but I talk a lot about Uber, I don't know if you took Uber, those who love to talk, and even when a woman chose Google.
When he got to the car, someone else in the car, and he looked at the strange and said, "Well, there's another car's passagger, he looked at her and said, "If she chose the culprit, and she hanged me with her face."
So Barcelona chose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose that she was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, and it's very interesting that we can imagine whoever makes these decisions: if we go to Google today, it has 57 thousand results, what do we click?
(Laughter) 91% of people explain the results of the first Google page: Who chose a place we went to eat the people, was I even Google?
(Laughter) After that, what I do, I go there and click on the website seven, I love doing seven, I see there's a website, I go to the website 7 and click, just to ask you to know, "I'm here to ask us?"
These speakers in English have a name in the behavior economy, also has a name, don't notice what it is. (Laughter) So, this is harassment: there is a theory of an authonic that I gave to a simple way to understand these little pushers in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person was in my talk, and at the end of the talk, came to me and said, "Now I understood myself, I thought there are struggles."
(Laughter) In this talk, I'd like to take a picture of me, cutting the ice ... (Laughter) It's not the case.
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of life here: 300,000 and 70 conversations about what I do, I make these experiments to understand how people behave, usually a text you'll take in your life, more than 400 inscribed people, of confirmation in TEDx, everyone here has received one and asked for an email.
This can make us manipulate someone.
Knowledge is a tool: danger, and this is that if you have it, you can use it to do because someone buys it is something that they don't need, or you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use to make a diabetes patient know the right time as well as insulin.
Or you can use to agitate truck accidents, like this bonet, the same autochem, which makes the metal wave to detect a thread to educate an accident.
