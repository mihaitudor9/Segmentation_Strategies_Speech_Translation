I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
She said, "That the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way it treats their children.
Except that in Brazil ...
We're living in a paradox.
Our children are what we have of the most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and yet.
Our children are getting very bad for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection.
It requires us to make changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what are most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat violence.
What if they rebel?
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children, in their social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here.
Things don't work well either, we may not commit more sincere crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood, and we'll take it.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Starting with her pregnancy, to have to understand.
These seas.
Gabriela's mother wants to.
He has a natural birth.
Here is the moment of relationship, of affection with your daughter, to receive with your husband.
That baby who will be born?
She then starts to attend pre-natal and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces a C-section culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is harmful, dangerous, painful.
And that generates a shameful statistics in our country: 93% of birth in the private network, for example, Rio de Janeiro, 93 percent.
They are made by C-section.
It includes 15 to 20% of developed parents.
This generates huge benefits for children, that makes us lose this moment of love.
It asserts to a surgical accident, with a woman is hurt, imobilized, of course, she can be humanized and can be done well, but certainly there won't be the same benefits in a normal birth, remembering that there are claims needed for each one of these sines that we'll mention.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I left maternity.
One of the many pediatrists that can be there.
Working, it's going to tell reality: you can take here a bottle, a small formula, milk milk, in the case of it, in need, it's hungry.
She goes home more insecure, and her grandmother goes home and says, "You've grown up with a wood, what business you, you're alive, strong?"
The child is crying, so he's weak, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise.
For the consumer, but it adds the advertisement in itself by the names it gives to the forms, they premiere.
Have you experienced it?
Aprime.
In the maternal milk, he's entered, he's a lover.
But he, precisely, comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industry advertising directly to the doctor, they make their partner from the doctor.
Convention of their nutritional qualities, congresses, and sponsoring integrally medical societies, conquering the sympathetic of the pediatrist, who end up unconsciously being one of the greatest causes of basic dismission.
And this way we're losing.
Social privileges are not an immigration.
Through the first sin, which is the privation of natural birth and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that will even reflect on adult life, that science is discovering now.
My Gabriela grows, her mother will end a license, she will have to go to a crew because she can't take care of vovement.
And it will spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution.
But when we get home, these parents are tired of tired of tired tires of long work, of helplessments, and they will live very little with their daughter.
There's still work to do at home, on weekends they'll pass.
And they'll take BAP to post-rababá because, after all, no one is iron, and what happens, we lose what is most precious in childhood, with video.
Our children.
We regret this much with the master and adolescence of this, and the child loses his relief with the most important people in their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone.
To be at home with this person.
These are our precious children, and we are losing this because of external and sincere, of the third-thirization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, don't have time, don't have money to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give food, frozen, industrialized food, what supermarkets show to brilliant Brazilians.
They end up exchanging, we end up exchanging traditional Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy, because of a rich food.
In fat, saturated fat.
Namous excess of salt and sugar.
Black people out there, lines inside, all the weapons that the industry, through highly developed food engineering.
Do it.
so that children can be completely addicted to industrialized food and in this way, unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're jokes.
"And ...?"
This brings serious problems with diabetic obesity that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to provide food and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy, that it comes in a number of agrotoxis, we are world consumption champions of agrotoxes, this is the sin.
From childhood intoxication, which also brings serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a creation called "chequeerma," which has cables for four months, and somebody knows that, highly negative to the involvement of a child, she has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run around, go out.
However, our urban lives don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they stay home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, I embrace myself, and don't want everyone to escape.
Guys, this is statistic.
Eight to 10 hours connected to your devices today.
Again, connecting with the game device, it's great, but not eight hours later, children no longer have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
As a child, it's a wonderful thing: we played "Dedanha," who played "Dedanha," here, the country chose the letter B, right?
We used to play Joglo Personal, in the moment of family reunion of laughing humour, of things that stay in our memory of us in childhood, we looked at the January, and saw the landscape going through meditation, not so much today, it's two babies and two tablets for each one, if you can't do anything in the car.
Even in moments, that exists, guys.
Even in moments when the child most needs - this exists, this comes from there, but you can say, "Ipórico," "Ipote."
(Laughter) This is the name, out there.
It still comes with a layer to cover the tablet associated with a wig look, right?
Even in the moments she needs the most consciousness, this is what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this makes us confin our children, and prevent them from having moments of awareness, of void, of TED.
TED is fundamental in childhood because TED and void are bercers of what is most important to us: creativity and imagination, and we are breastfeeding this from our children with this sin of confinement and permanent distraction.
Bela watched four hours on TV per day.
It's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it spend at maximum four hours, and it spend more time on American TV, and in our work, sometimes, because we have less time at school.
Then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to Park, she doesn't go to the stool, the family does the classical show of the Brazilian family today in week, "O".
Very well, but it will be more massacrated by advertising, for consumer values, and this advertising is a wild obesity.
The mobility that explodes its capacity to distinguish, to fantasy in reality, that explore her love by characters, making her fall in love with toxic products, toys, loads and brands, inclusion of this love.
And that instills values like an obsessive consumerism.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
utility in worse things.
And what will it be like?
In obesity, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drink, not even people, advertisement is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, it's obviously the one who most needs friendship are teenagers and they are deeply affected by child consumption.
Gabriela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, they add another class that is meditation class.
But she could meditate in the little square, guys, at the balancing, the wonderful thing: Who has never meditated in balance?
Look at the sky, look at the floor.
"Look at you, there's no better meditation than this!"
I'll spend more money in one class, and then it won't be exposed to that.
The type of erotization is that our society proposes, "Merodization."
that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products.
An organization that is based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worst, in the dissociation of sexuality.
Love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly deforming their mind when we have eight or ten years old.
This is the sin in adopting until childhood and early erotization.
Gabriela.
There's peace that's afraid of her because they don't live with her, so instead of limiting them, they put them in a tribe.
It becomes the family queen and not a member of the family, it starts to decide the programs, the cardboard, if it's going bad at school, the school's fault, we have to talk to a teacher.
She'd gain many gifts, when she needed, it would be presence.
She realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have the authority, a child, sometimes when she's two or three years old, who realizes that her parents don't have the authority, she's a little blanket.
It gets insecure, it needs people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms. We know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, we interrupt ourselves between the experience of our children and the world.
By doing that they don't have a life experience and, therefore, they don't develop ways to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, that the world will certainly give them later, this is a sin.
from the organization and the superpower of childhood.
Faced with so many problems, of course, childhood will give symptoms: the child will be rebelled, quarrels, sneakers, and will get sick, eat too much, become obese, goes bad at school, don't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain.
What did I love?
The solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to the blacks so they can behave well, this is called "medicalization and it's the worst of the animals."
Well, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in fact.
What the factory is producing exactly medicine, right?
This is what we are doing for our children, not only with alienate children, adults also in a shameful way, medicalization of the most deleted phenomena of today.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are so much assembly they appreciate with this individualistic society.
The three sidewalks are the market that grows the most, the depressed, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, the way of medicine, which is to the disturb of attention and activity.
It appeared in 1999, 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't a disease epidemic, this is a massacre against childhood, we're rooting, "normatizing," and I'm sure some of these genius, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, we'd have lost that of wonderful warming.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, better ways, changing the paths, and problems are very complex, I don't see, without end of sines and factors that feed each other.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity.
As the philosopher said, there's always a solution.
Simple, easy.
And invariably wrong.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I think we reflect on this, a well-known TEDx solution, I'm already spending my time, but it's OK, I'm a little bit, a solution that passes only by changes in two factors: time.
And space, but nothing.
In relation to time?
What can we do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today, means a discomfort payment, almost all the churches?
The décima is to give a part of what we have most precious for our childhood, which are our sacred ones.
What's most precious nowadays, guys?
Our capital.
The most important thing is time.
Time?
We have 17 hours of age.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing.
And if it doesn't happen every week, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children in relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds.
Let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes in 15 seconds, and imagine a healthy place.
A healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, is a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life.
It was a good place to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
Look at your eyes.
Give me if you fit in this statement.
Isn't it?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This shows the importance of nature, in nature, is deeply associated with health, deeply associated with health, and deeply with all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and it had an interesting experience. I started that with Patricia, back then, who wasn't giving me my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you said something incredible!
I talked about convergence and health of sustainability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
All health does well the environment and vice versa good.
To ride bike, a body does well, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transportation does well for the invitation time, reduces the institution, with my organic body that was seeing the body, does good for the rivers, does good for the land, see the animals.
Things always go into slow in a positive way, creating simple habits, and I live with nature, properly said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, and give us moment of awareness, especially for children, who will get to know each other and learn to deal with them, we'll develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, only and the green that produces good to be physicist, mental, and then reduce all childhood problems.
Raise children for nature, and when I talk about bringing children to nature, we're not talking about spaces when we dominate with the steps of time. Look, and now there'll be a bad space, no, we're talking about domination.
We're talking about jumping the wall.
And for the city, embrace the cities, go to play in the squares, take public spaces.
With games with love, with affection, with guest.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and not only the initiative to use physics, it's seen, reivindicating why public policies facilitate us with public space with nature, that promote bikes.
free inventions of these spaces, neighborhood symbolization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take us these places, safety.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "ocupaque," is practically used for citizen resistance today, it means to take public steps with joy.
And ...
The city governance is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as it happened in São Paulo, where you can see here, in a picture of Represa Billings, a source of water from São Paulo for 30 to 40 years, and today.
By the mago-vernance?
And cities that have quality of life.
Because they have participation.
Are they returned and people demand?
Imagine the public policies voted to public interest, with its sustainability, with equity.
With transparency and accounts, there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this, to finish the same scientists, which announce a terrible crisis.
Reducing inequality from the social point of view, it puts environmental view, of course, doing everything we already know, right?
acting through sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing the energy pattern.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to convince, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature, we'll make them love nature, because only by experimenting.
The cold Kachoeira doesn't sell YouTube, it's that we learn to love that little spark and defend in the future, that we only defend what we love.
Let's go to the city, take public spaces, with play, with entertainment, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, I spread myself showing the gallery side phase that left us ...
Unfortunately, this year, he said that the utopia is on the horizon, the more I get closer, the more it moves away, if we take a thousand steps, it pushes a thousand steps, so what is the utopia exactly to not make us walk.
It makes us walk abroad, thank you.
In 2007.
I came across a great group of young people and adults with disabilities.
Explusted from regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
It was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Café terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion within school, with parents, with their children and partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities -
Sometimes they're left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think that they are not able to have friendships, to interact with people.
What's the case of the student Igor, for example, who in the other school he studied?
For four years he didn't get into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers, so, during four years, he stayed in the court, participating in all kinds of physical education classes, and since he loved to run, and people didn't have the strength either, he was running all the time.
When I got to the Seja Campulimpo, I sought to know Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
So that he could ...
They improved the best learning.
The school?
A paradise was a place of despair.
(Laughter) Well, it's not like a pulimpo, today he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
AC: I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy, freedom of expression, and it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning.
The schools think.
That they're not able to assist these students and that they're not prepared to receive, but schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use and believe that they're capable and that these leaves inside the school.
To do well for them, it's going to do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
(Laughter) Why is the choice like that?
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
AC: Do you want to know what I learned over ten years working with disabled people?
(Laughter) I learned to appreciate my look.
They survive with people so they can see it.
And I learned the design of my audition, living with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
(Laughter) I learned to value my ideas, with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise of friendship, and the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart and the heart of my students.
Thank you very much.
CF: Good evening.
I always liked eating.
But I never went to cook you.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother.
To cook, right?
Cozinhar, working in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Páscoa.
She did everything with much love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
(Applause)
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
Food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a medicine month.
So I decided to study a little about Iurveda and macrobiology, because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took away from many of us young people, which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
We build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of urban life and rural life.
It's a little ...
From life.
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can.
It's to connect with nature.
And I said, "And ...?"
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside.
And there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
It's food, food.
As a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that we ...
It's to do it.
To restore the food system.
Changing the food dynamic.
The production process.
Distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the meat production process, for example.
There are two principles that lead.
The meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces.
The cheaper it is produced.
Worst is quality and...
The greater the cost of the environment is artificially accelerated and for our health in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated the animal's life cycle.
ELI.
He lost, he started to grow and produce in a way that his bodies...
There's a time that doesn't help, and it starts to lose, decrease drastically, its quality of life.
Your health and your life time.
So?
I believe that we ...
It can and must change this system.
From this food system, I was passing the other day in the supermarket.
He noticed it.
That Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can it be, this is very complex because how can it cost so little?"
You can create an animal from birth to abate.
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process on the industrial scale is also a lot.
Let's say this harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, nowadays, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agro toxic farms in the world.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but even so.
They keep tolerating this abuse in use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why?
But the answer is because our current society ...
There are inverted values, there is an investment of values, why does a person worry?
In not buying a failed perfume because you think it's gone.
There's an allergic reaction because it doesn't know the procedure, it doesn't know which type of chemistry is inside it.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal.
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, the more you buy, for example, a pill of leface.
It's a bit of organic interface, you're paying, not only you're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go, instead of one on social media, many times they don't know that behind that leface, there was someone who took care of, with all love and affection, and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think...
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason.
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption.
Also.
It's the way we...
Today's consuming food is scary, my grandmother is Pulista, she lives in São Paulo.
If I took her and put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure she's going to be very scared.
Seeing those executives or those appreciated people walking down the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because catting is something that people, many people think it's a waste of time, but actually, it was going, finally.
To have almost a simple one.
But because that doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing and feeding.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the streets, which is very...
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little birds, biscuits, and so on, have many chemical additives.
And an exaggerated level of "outdoreaçúcar" which are the three, it's the trufficient, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a physiological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products are too harmful, I don't even call them food. For me, they are made up of food, because you can even consume and satisfy, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorn, that little panel in the place of microwaves, look?
This question - (Laughter) This might seem these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange bread's popcorn for the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you'll increase half.
It's consuming.
The chemicals you wouldn't put, I have absolute certainty in your panick.
And you're also polluting with the packaging from microwaves, from a packaging that could be less trash in the world, so I think consumption changes.
It's excessive of industrialized products, it's really very harmful.
So, let's talk ...
"Yes ...
To summarize this question of the process ...
The production of food, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not sweet.
Very good.
If it's not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
Play brings independence, brings high.
self-knowledge brings autonomy.
Bring safety, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, it industrial doesn't cook, simply food processes.
So, if you let the industry feed you?
"Yes ...
It will choose what you'll have for dinner.
Lazanha, frozen, frozen battle, hamburger, blind dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
"Ah! I don't know
"Oh no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean of each day?
Who had our belly and our soul.
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, have to think that doing very work, very anti-personatic food, is waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean, from night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes, you have a bean ready on the pressure panel.
You can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
In leaving frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a street, fresh that you do in 20 to 30 minutes, more legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator, when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
Esperal of the book "Dipits".
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen.
As we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
Menine, girl.
Children, adult and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education.
We teach children, bringing the children to the fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life.
We can...
It's to build a better future, these children will grow.
A holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Many people think it's from the supermarket shelter.
So, the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the industry.
Fharmaceutical because they'll stay.
Very less sick.
Knowing, eating cash food, healthy food.
I believe we have to ...
Change.
Addynamics.
We have to change our food.
Or, "Yes."
Our value.
Too ...
It's that we have food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thank you for the leave.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, yes.
It's education.
It's education and prevention.
So?
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose the food well?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much.
(Video) Life is not here that we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
It's here and goes the bottom.
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandfather, Mario Güeyson, was the first blind planter.
Tlavora mechanized in Brazil, here in the land of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my helpful grandmother and had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five brothers.
I arrived in this world, happened yesterday, we, at 50 years ago, are the stories we realize that make us who we are and, by counting, we transform ourselves.
And who listens?
It also transforms itself.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
We are our story before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored all the stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early, I always liked writing, reading, telling.
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to experience mourning.
So having told this and contacting this story brings one of the most beautiful things about it.
That is the power that people can feel welcomed in each other's story, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously I'm someone.
"Yeah!"
I saw and will sit on the color of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products.
I understood when I was 45 years old that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
And I said, "Oh!
Help people to tell their stories because the publicity world had been very small for me.
So, I started doing this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk about it two years ago at TEDx.
Committing entrepreneurship with purpose, something so uncomfortable for us, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying.
Because that's what he's always suffered.
And he wanted it.
dividing the story with others, and I left because it had to do with the theme.
Except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints.
A right about all that had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and, otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can accept who they are, as we've already said here, without fear?
And he understood that, he was changing the top.
And on the day, Tiago ...
He grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and to speak for the first time he was gay.
Absolutely.
And he spoke with a lot of property, about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful.
"And ...?"
I like to tell this because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, but also to have seen that the roots they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself.
And just as he welcomed, I'll tell his story.
A lot of people.
If he welcomes me in his story, the last week, he sent me.
A big saying.
That many boys have been looking for it even more in the sea.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that he wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way.
That I had no shame at all.
So, tell stories to me?
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
Giving a lot of people to be here, right?
In this place...
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Tell something funny shows your children's pictures, but not really.
I think this is not the most important thing.
And, for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you need a lot of courage.
And it's not by the roof that courage has color of heart.
What about that?
I told the story of "Ave," the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, and he researchs listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDx d'Oçador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day ...
Two weeks before everything.
From his talk.
I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this, every time you talk to me, you say, it's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk.
About listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was heard, when he needed the most, when he thought about it, this is "suppicide" when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell.
There are so many addiction courses, oratory, and writing.
But who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we'll change.
So we talk about change, but...
There's always this fear.
And, like this moment, we always arrive and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And for others.
And listening.
You see, also, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
There's no one minute, it scratches us.
To look at others, to come hug and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) This, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
MA: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the variousest stories I heard, out of all the others.
When she taught me that empathy too, I learned high school.
Why?
We need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have yes.
We have at least a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me?
And for everyone, I came from a poem I myself wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
From the 4th of the flaws, the salts of the ...
From the values of the kitchen of uncertainty, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to give them faith in life.
Faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, of being that they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right of bitter almonds of non-profit, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know, to free their story, that, despite being important, it's not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Thank you very much.
(Sigh) The truth is that on Earth, to be told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, it's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and step, and the stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they're only part of their plurial spaces, there's no stilago or dark, ugly, rich and poor.
It's just a legacy of existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed about my life.
A phase where I was denied the right of being just one.
I don't seek acceptance, but, in respect, from the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, when she was born, to resist and to exist was always a life condition for me, and the right for life.
So, why are we here below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, accepting, empathy, and understanding definitely that the different than the other, the universe is infinite, along with them, millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important to Greek?
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equals, so that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
The different thing is beauty, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this wants to be rich, this exchange.
So, I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
AC: Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God the reason for me to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
(Laughter) But the question is, what was there in the bathroom that wasn't in the other places and if it was denied for me?
Or better, why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
I'm trying to be different.
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
For lack of information.
And when it's about trans universe, this path is harder, I researched on the Internet, but let's see people like me, I didn't even know what trans people were, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of transitions, and that desire to grow up inside me, outward.
Theater showed a new world, it was a turning point in my life, it was in the theater that I learned to deal with difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand others.
So, I started to look for my true teenage years, and I started to get down, it's as if you enter a cockle, stay a while there, and a beautiful bubble came out.
Through this process, it has painful phases and not everyone is there to deal with it.
It's very difficult when you're in the midst of a mix of transformations, and you still have to learn how to deal with the not acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world, and if you're a black woman, fat, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily.
In the case of us, weird, for example, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, is it that you're transhumed, our new thing? There are no traffic guys, no, you're phase, you're going to pass?"
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
Is there any crazy person here who wants to see this auditation?
As a white man has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
I said, "So?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And, secondly, if we compare with the United States, for example, to 64 trans people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016, with 21 other deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have even nine times more chances of dying with restrictions of curiosity and violence.
Being a transsexual is not an option.
But in a living condition.
There's no magic form, there's no strength, no strength, resistance, expectation of 35 years, there's no one who was still like that, that we could better measure this panel better, but it's not.
I could stay here the whole afternoon, the whole woman, explaining to you how I transded my life story, for each one of us, the protagonist of your own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
For example, I'm the living proof of this, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my person depends on us.
My art, as a way of deconstruction of ideas, to establish myself, I was invited to live a trans character, I dressed myself as a model, magazine layer, and "perform" and Thuber, and at "APs has a career," I was invited to more than one million people in 130 countries.
(Audience) It's a responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences for so many people.
Representing a flag and being ugly to all that I represent alongside it.
But, I did, abused, I went to my name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "It's a comment book like a man who's capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What's no price?
Audience: Yes.
There's no price to receive message from mothers from other girls who thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
To understand the difference is someone who can definitely change the world, but I also understand that I don't want to be just the sadnesses.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm much beyond that.
I'm far beyond trans, but to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference adds.
The sky?
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was I?
Or is it there?
A lot of blue.
Liberty without limits.
I and the sky.
Your and me.
I don't look at myself anymore, I don't ask myself to stop.
I've already got away from my corridors.
In the past, only what remain their scars, that mark my soul.
Well, the future.
What does the future promise?
That's what I want.
A being on the side, now I am, now I'm going to fly, come, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I've never been able to explain to children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovarian system, that doctors called "teratoma," one of them one day said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, it won't take a sixth grade." Well, it had been called with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do a surgery there.
AC: So, I took the courage, I had never been established, given point: nothing.
And it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later at the ICU.
The same yesterday I was with children with cancer, and then I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
And ...
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's no visiting time."
And I asked her to give me her hand.
Even for me to sleep.
I cut only after the bedroom, I needed cancer, measures and committed gangs.
I'd say to the children, "Don't Google."
Because after all,
It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital websites, and the only thing that happened to me ...
That the safe information at that moment was that I would die.
Because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
That sometimes I didn't help, that I wouldn't engage, and how would you engage with someone if you can't even say the word?
That's it.
And I was stubborn.
And ...
Opening what bothered me, forgotten, cold, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
(Laughter) So, at that moment, I realized.
This information from society, for them to have hair, in fact, it wasn't for me.
They knew it was for them.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with this I went to see many other information I thought wasn't the most suitable.
AC: When I entered the hospital, a doll, the children said, "Wow, you launched your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer."
I took it from you. She said, "We don't take it, OK, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed and the kids started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I went to...
It's to put the cateter, because I did my therapy before, the first one made a pork, I received a kit from the hospital.
In this kit there came a sabone, a toothpaste and a toothpaste of teeth, but also a shampoo, a burrow.
And a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
For me, this is information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
We went on, we were joking, but that's how we think the child doesn't understand, right?
Who think the child doesn't know, she knows the protocol called chemotherapy, procedures, all that, sometimes parents try not to protect them, but you think, "Oh, but the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy?"
Pharmaceutic is a strong medicine, what will it think?
That will fall our hair, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls because it killed cells that quickly doubled.
But not only the tumor cells double quickly, but also the hair cells, they still understood and said, "Oh, it's working!
And we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to call me.
If there's a patient who's going to put catéter, you can come here and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs." "Ah, but then, profit comes running," and there, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising, I called doctors, health professionals, and my creative friends, and we decided to open an NGO, called BABABABA, because it's the cancer BA.
It's focused on the patient, he's in the middle, but at the end of the process, they're health professionals, advertisers, but, with something very important, sometimes, like something that doesn't seem to be explained, when you like someone, and you write the theme with your heart, you drawings, ventricles.
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is distributed for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask children from New Zelândia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and what is required in Northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate, that children will do.
And information sometimes isn't just that thing, information technology, it's not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a slope.
No kit.
So, what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when it's events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
And this sometimes isn't only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't exist.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the room, dark, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?
And then you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what a difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, there's a child with an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to spend the window, to see and with my life is good, and when we need self-esteem.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
Audience: Yes.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
She saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to help some children, which we think is very important: I entered the hospital so we can save many others. Thank you.
(Applause) In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
And, fortunately, this isn't easy.
The dependency here gives me disease and brain disease, and a disease that complicates people's lives a lot.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, really, the answer has?
In us, in order to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of what we thought about several things, and one of these things is in our own organism.
This organism that has its own defense mechanisms, which can protect itself from great threats, one of these defense is in our brain, is called "barring emato in serphalic".
The myatocephal barrier, despite being a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and that make them go.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the packaging packaging barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system.
AC: Our immune system is composed by anticorpos cells and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances too, in this video, you can see the macrofogo cites it and neutralize it.
Audience: Yes.
Today.
Can we not join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are ours?
(Applause)
Some years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying the people who end up using big drug quantities, producing anti-psype against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
Let's go!
It's enough!
There's no need for more drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
I said, "And me and my team?"
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our immune system, produces anticpios and anti-codfos are big molecules, and then that problem that medical barrier had to let the drugs go freely, this tiny molecule connects to a large molecule, and pum, is no longer on the wall barrier, you do.
(Applause)
Look at this image here, how is this process beautiful, OK?
Here, on your right, we have a while that hasn't received a vaccine: these white dots you can see, it's a cocaine molecule marked with radiation.
When these rats are not immunized, once we are able to imune them, they receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it freely passes and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
Here you see on your left side.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was stopped, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater radiation concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocking the passing, drugs get arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency, so what our group is working now is, in fact, to help people gain freedom, we believe.
And maybe, in a while with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide, a time to gain freedom again and ...
Discuting with themselves if they want.
Using or not using drugs, thank you very much.
I'm being.
Interapute.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to read and say that -
Besides?
Danorose.
Besides?
In psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
When you get angry, you lose, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
Patology of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
Get it out.
Great meeting, TEDx.
He was born because.
Why?
No, music is being.
Toting from the beginning.
What is the norm?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some meditation.
The war?
Cool, for example, is an example, maybe the most mortifero.
What is it?
Your lady.
How far can I understand?
There are two fundamentals.
The most important part of the norm is the context.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
I'd respect the fact that not always.
The norm didn't exist.
Not always.
It's existed.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times?
What?
We live in a context.
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It doesn't predict corruption.
Dishumanity in its word.
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This is adapting to a sick system?
And keep it?
I've been.
A worker?
There's more than 30 in one year.
from the International University of Paz.
Or Unipas.
And people think that peace is to be a good one.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's good to share!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes ...
A little bit of relatives.
The soldier for peace.
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must, and that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even.
A desperation, conscious, lucid.
An indignation?
Justo!
This reminds me of it.
It seemed to my family.
When is my daughter?
Isabela.
She was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked her.
What princess do you like most?
Gata bubble, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought.
And he answered.
I like all the May's writing.
I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
Sometimes, because it is sensitive to feel in your own skin.
A pain?
The contradictions.
That the Northetics don't feel.
People who looked for me.
The panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
Is it a myth?
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests.
And these people have experienced being desertified.
I respect a lot.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy.
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a blink that captures.
The cultural contradictions.
Sistendic, and sometimes it doesn't fail.
And how did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between what?
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
He doesn't say anything.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call.
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an insônia.
The problem is in Armodes, we don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here.
It's slow.
"Uh."
Beautiful knowing I was ...
A psychotherapist told me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He raises himself to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
It's silly.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand?
What do I want for you?
Armacy.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
What's nothing against correctness?
At that moment, "Hi!
who suffered a distress!
So ...
Have you spoken?
It's from norms, machismo.
Does racism?
So, homofobia?
Of various?
Exclusions.
None!
We could talk about the norm, it's environmental.
Nermosis gives it.
Another specialization, a person who knows almost everything.
And the tortage salt catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mime and doesn't realize, its existence doesn't make sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe?
It has a concept.
In this education, which has also been here.
Alright?
How being?
A possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The desire that brought us incarnation.
It's what's on us on a stage like this.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just by a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would get lost.
So ...
In the foundation of norms?
"Yes."
The context.
There's another one.
Very important.
It's an evolution, it's also been said.
Today.
It's the question, we need to ask ourselves.
What differentiates?
But a human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Money.
A bird.
From a snake, from a caco?
I ask a friend, "Wow!
They give him a step.
A Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
From a developing country, mother was Max, Niffin.
Chinen?
When I met my elderly, he told us that, since he was a boy, he wanted to know that the human being was different.
Of the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to his father?
That very respectful one.
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
A little light came up, and he said that the first estupidologist, the estupidology, a science we need to study, it differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who?
He absolutely wants...
Lentin, I like to remember the rulentur.
The creator of biodiction, a great brother?
He told us that we need to be ...
The hipotalic stupid, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest Bral?
The question.
It's stupid because it reversed with rationality, a person can be highly stupid, and it's highly alert.
Rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Coolified.
And to do like a person talking about development?
with graphs, branches.
Sufisticable?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, shaking it.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
What for him?
I had only one.
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
In this human stubbornness.
And he agreed, "Aimist, in relation to a universe?"
I still have my doubts.
But I need to say that I agree.
Diainist and Max Nefing, although, respecting them.
And considering that...
They are pointing out not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the norm.
Human beings?
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
to serve.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inacabase, it's unpleasant.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen and go to the sea.
We don't.
We are born unpleasant.
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or...
I said, "There are help."
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems to be necessary to develop a rational demonstration, no.
It's said.
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
Emotional intelligence, developing unitical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
His own.
Confucious.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Do you quote?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted wasn't that day anymore, the borders of justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you change clothes.
And five minutes, I lead to be a whole existence.
It was exchange.
of Corrics.
This is the task.
In that sense?
A nursery ...
It refers to an evolutionary estagnation.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: how to adhere?
The 21st century for human beings.
Nothing less than that finds this paradox.
In the future.
The new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being.
As Tia Chatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, when to serve.
He asked someone to prohibit.
Say God.
And IT.
And he said, "Fured."
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially!
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking.
It doesn't happen from a story that we hear.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned this story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was obsessed.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flowers.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
He played in the middle of the bus and came back.
With patience?
The lines.
Get married.
I used to play in the middle, I'm already a tattoo artist, seeing that, and said, "But, or see flower?
Do you think that with these drople ridicles you're going to turn off this infernal fire?
And I've already said, "I know I don't."
Let's talk about everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with two intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little.
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions.
And, failed, and I keep failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
I do it with others, with others.
I'm together and with a moment.
I recommend a book to the conspiration of Corean of Marily Fex.
who studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a giant radio.
The beija-floa!
He doesn't have any ideology, he doesn't have any flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he's part of it, we can do this.
We can stand up.
And we can do our part, in fact.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, you don't need to be on this stage.
But on stage...
It's your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Maybe it's just about claiming.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with the poem.
It's accessible.
Very good.
It's renewable.
I went to Renato in Tedesco.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen, created others.
For other visions.
They built arms that had this meadow.
To forgotten the harvest.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
More simple.
Always far.
And inside.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
I entered a good school.
Decorus.
I got good grades.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
(Laughter) I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a merchant.
Since my mother has reality.
I choose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I said, "I've spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort."
And I receive a curse.
I was a multinational company that didn't recognize me by their relatives.
Whether it's "treming," I work 12 hours per kidney, up to the limit of their strength.
Be obedient, your fatigue needs to be chronic.
AC: Do interactive meetings, video games that wouldn't take somewhere.
show that you are important for the structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
It took a six-flakes point, and found someone, dating, relating, marriage.
He's mini opponent.
Scale the corporate pyramid.
He sees the shirt, lambotas.
The job exchange.
LP: Be a manager.
Carre of the firm.
(Laughter) "They want the freel in happy hour marked."
S: We're badly cut and sneakers.
I said, "Dad the shirt."
Luke took first apartment.
He has a child.
After two years, your second son.
It's listening.
(Laughter) Try the car, yes, last year, people completely unqualified being promoted before you, Disney, two years later, all of seven days per Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami, projects that start and dismoronize like their desires.
A continuous feeling of changing teeth.
The void that the passers at the mall at the weekends are no longer able to applause.
The shock is an antenna of pleasure that, if it goes so soon, the marketing label is broken.
Take a shirt.
(Laughter) The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle-time crisis.
The meeting with my colleagues from college, my God, spent some years, went fast, is, life is short.
(Applause)
My children in school, my God, as they grown fast, is the hidden life.
Audience: Yes.
We'll have very cut in halluces from the center: you're a director, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the weekend on the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we are going to sell the beach apartment, children grew up and don't even want to go further, to see the shirt.
(Laughter) The cholesterol is a little high, its fluid body, like an astronaut that spent years floating in zero gravity, (Laughter) No meat on account of the healthy habit of passing toothpaste feet after all infections.
Lut it out, cold lactose, green juice, semestal plan of the academia that you used for two months today is fourth, days of beet, liver hamburgues, after staying late, in the sign, to close a project, because life is too short to eat leface.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, will probably never come.
The continuous fear of losing a job, today, doesn't value the experience anymore.
The fear of everything, the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
The continuous fear that prevents you from living.
Fear of death, a brief sense of suffocation: Where's the air, otherwise I'm focused.
The complete disconnection with your children decorated from the 12 hours of work for decades: empty retirement, surrounded by useless and unjust things.
You're a winner, this is your only consensus.
His life as an executive executive.
Take a shirt.
From wood, for the real time, thank you.
