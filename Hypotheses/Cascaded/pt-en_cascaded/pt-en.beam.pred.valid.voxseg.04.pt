I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What this said is that the true character of a society is revealed.
By the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox: our children are what we have of most precious.
We want their well-being at any cost, we will give them our life for them, and, however, our children come from maltratted to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny them basic rights, such as health, housing, education, food, we treat them with violence.
And if they rebel, we offer them prison.
Things don't go well either: we commit, maybe, not more sincere crimes.
Gabriela's mother wants to have a natural birth, that moment of affection link with her daughter to receive, along with her husband, that baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal medicine, and quickly the hospital Medicine industry, to a typical middle class child, who produces the culture of cesing over seven nets that we'll late.
And we are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working, will tell reality, "Here, can you take a breast is a formula like this, of milk in grandma, in case of her, she goes home more safe, arrives home, her grandma, her mother, what business is you, is strong?"
The child is crying, the tolerator is thin, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a large part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms: prize, ex-person.
Suprim, and breast milk is money, it's for, it's breastfeeding, but it just comes with a lot of love, and it's infinitely superior to any of these forms.
Audience: Yes.
But the industries make the advertisement directly to the doctor, making a doctor their marriage, convinced of their nutritional qualities, in congresses, and sponsoring entirely the pediatric society, that end up unconsciously being one of the biggest causes of dismission in Brazil, and in this way we'll end the permit, it'll have, because it grows, because vovation can't take care of it.
And she'll spend sometimes six, eight, ten, 12 hours in an institution, but to get home, her parents are tired of tirednesses in a long journey of work, of enrollments, and they'll live little with her daughter, and they'll take babies because, after all, when no one is iron.
And what happens, we lose what's most precious in childhood, unlikely to our children, we often regret their adolescence, and the child loses the relief to the most important people of their lives.
Convide is what gives us intimacy, the capacity to be together, love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this because of this terrible peculiar of childhood's personalization.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay a maid, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderful, healthy, because of a rich food, fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar, crocantes outside, all the weapons that the media tells us to give frozen food, what the supermarkets show, they can't, because they are boring.
This brings serious problems, such as diabetic obesity, which are exploiting in childhood, and even if we want to provide food, and we consume healthy food for our children, it's no longer so healthy because it comes in a number of agrotoxes, and we are world consumption champions of agrotoxes, this sink of the intoxication of childhood also leads serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a "chicerrima" creation that has hair for four months, and someone knows that highly negative of the involvements of a child.
It has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run, hide, go out, and, however, in our urban life, it doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid of leaving the child to leave, she's at home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, she moves me, and doesn't want everyone to get in touch.
So these children spend eight statistical people, eight to ten hours connected with their devices today, once again, connect with the wall playing, it's great, but not eight hours later, the children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is getting worse.
We looked at Janela, and saw a landscape passing in the form of meditation. However, today, two babies and two tablets for each one, if we can't do anything in the car, even in moments, that exists, people.
(Laughter) Even in moments when the child needs the most - this exists, it comes from there, but you can say, "Ip√≥rico," "Ipote."
This is the name "IPOR," which I opened her watching four hours on television a day, she spend more time on television, the Americans were in the record, in our work because we have less time in school, because TEDx is more important for us, creativity and imagination, and we're breastfeeding this from our children with a sin in confinement and permanent distraction.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, not to the park, the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family in the weekend, "O."
It's very good, but it'll be more massacrated by advertising, for toxic values, toys, careers, and brands, according to this love, and that instills these values as an obsessive consumption.
Hypervalorization of the appearance.
The utility in worse things that will slow down.
In obesity, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drink, not people, propaganda is totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, it's obviously the ones who need the most to friendship are teenagers, and they are deeply affected by child consumption. Gabriela is with the agenda full of commitment because her parents want, because her parents want my house to be competitive, and her agenda is full of commitment.
But she could meditate on the little square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who has no meditation in the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." (Laughter) There's no better meditation than that!
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes: merosization, that uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, to the excessive value of appearance, and even worse, to the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating eroodization, and this affects children directly deforming their minds when we have eight, ten years old, this sin of autization of the end to childhood and erootization for which?
And Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put her on trono, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she goes wrong in school, the school's fault needed, you see the presence.
And she realizes that it's more and more that parents don't have the authority: a child, sometimes, two or three years old, who realizes that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this capacity, instead of that, we're doing what the Americans call "relecopter" with the difficulty, that the world will certainly give them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and superpower in childhood: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, birty, and will get sick, eat too much, it'll be obese, it's bad at school, it doesn't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it, it's not possible for these children in this way.
In the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chain, what's the solution we won't give to bad behavior children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, no, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, it's called "medicalization and it's the worst of the animals."
The quino de Mafalda says this, it's portrayed in a wonderful way, by telling the stories of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people going badly because of children, not only with alliate children, the adults also, in a way, are embarrassed.
The medicalization of the most direct phenomena of today: you see that, in the United States, 15% of children today are so mounted as black, this individualistic society.
Audience: Yes.
The three employees are the market that grows the most for depressants, we're arriving at this point, and Ritalina, the way for medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and imperativity, sold in 1999 70 thousand boxes, in 2010 more than 2 million boxes.
And this isn't a disease epidemic, this is the massacre against childhood, we're rotating, "normatizing," and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, we'd have lost that wonderful thing that brought us.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but for all problems, complex problems of humanity, as a philosopher said, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
Obviously.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we reflect on this, a very widespread TEDx solution, I'm already going through, and I'm going to pass in my time, but that's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence, and penitence, today means "attagment dismo," in almost all churches, "dizing" is to give a part of what we have the most precious for our childhood, which is our sacred, what we have the most precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance.
It's 1,7 hours that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This takes an hour and 40, a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just priorizing, and if it doesn't happen in the weekends, we start with it at the weekend, it's possible to give time to invite our children.
In relation to space.
I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fourteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes of the 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a healthy neighborhood, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not good for the cat to live.
Sexualize this place.
How would it be?
You can open your eyes.
And tell me if you fit in this statement.
JP: No?
I'm sure it's the biggest one of you, yes.
This brings us a little the importance of nature between us; nature is deeply associated with health; it does good for the rivers, it does good for the earth, it does good for the time of conviviality, reduces the three; the pollution; with my organic, which is well the body, the environment, and vice versa; riding bicycles, does well the body, pollution, communal transport; we know this, and what I do good for me, and I didn't know that everything I do for me is good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's open for me, and for me, it's open space for me, for me, for me, open space, for me, open space.
Look how wonderful!
He'll cut us off the fabrics, he'll give us moments of awareness, especially for children, who will know each other and learn to deal with them, we'll develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, only, and the green that produces physical well-being, psychological and mental well-being, and he'll reduce all the problems of childhood in Brazil, doing exactly this.
And not only the initiative to use physics, it was reinvented by this reason that public policies, that facilitate us with public space with nature, that promote ciclovies, free events of these spaces, dancing urbanization, the gardens in the city, public transport, to take us these places, safety.
Through accessible and caregivers, all of this is called occupation of a city, the word "copaque" used earlier for resistance and citizens, and mainly it means to take public space with joy, because they have participation, they are returned, and people demand, public agendas based on public interest, sustainability, and equity.
To conclude, the same scientists, who announce a terrible and environmental crisis, that's coming here, will come very early, our children will pick me up, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, that there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this.
And taking children to the outside, bringing children to the square, to now, to the relief, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality, bringing children to nature.
We're going to make them love nature, because only by experimenting the cold caching, not seeing YouTube, we learn more about this box, and they will defend in the future, because we only defend what we're doing, so, in summary, this is our proposal, let's take public spaces, with play, with participation.
That's it, and as we're talking about utopia, folks, I spread myself showing the air phase of the Galian that left us that year, unfortunately, he said that the utopia is on the horizon, the more I get closer, the more it pushes a thousand steps, so for the purpose of utopia, exactly to not make us walk.
What does it make us walk outside.
AC: In 2007, I came across a great group of young people and adults.
With disability, excluded from regular school, and since then.
My biggest challenge was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Caf√© terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
AC: To be able to discuss inclusion within school, with parents.
With their children and their partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside.
(Laughter) Stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
VR: To have friendship.
We need to interact with people.
I count the case of the student Igor, for example, who in the other school he studied?
AC: For four years he didn't go into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't have the strength either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education and, as he loved to run, he kept running all the time.
When I got to the Seja Campulimpo, I sought to meet Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school and what together we could do.
What for him to do?
They improved the best learning.
The school?
For me, it was a place.
of despair.
Well, isn't it a thumb?
AC: Today he's very happy, he has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
I believe that school goes far beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And you can teach the student to heal.
The learning process itself.
The schools think.
They are not able to assist these students and they are not prepared to receive us.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use and believe that they are capable and that they take off the school.
I'm going to do good for them.
It's going to do well for other students, for the school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
AC: Why did I look like this?
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years working with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see it.
And I learn.
You can know.
My hearing is living with people who don't hear.
I learned to appreciate my legs.
With those who can't walk.
I learned to appreciate my ideas with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart and the heart of my students.
to create connections.
And bonds of friendship.
And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook you: when I was a kid, I loved seeing my grandma cooking, right?
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, Pa√°scoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that, until today, she asked me, "How, and why did I go to the kitchen, and that's the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking?"
And, in adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet and, with it, I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study philosophy, they rescued in me something that I think modernization took away from many of us, young people.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
I built the food system through food, and I believe...
One of the side effects of modernization.
It's the detachment of man with nature, the letting go of urban life and rural life, so I believe we are people.
Slowly, it's a bit of rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way that we can connect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve, use as a tool.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool, and with that we see.
It's able to reestructure the food system, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it produces, the cheaper it produces.
Even worse is quality, and it begins to grow and produce in a way that their bodies arrive an hour that doesn't hold, and it starts to lose drastically decrease their quality of life, their health and their time of life.
So I believe we can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilogram, I said, "Guys, how can it be, this didn't enter my head."
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very... Each Brazilian consists on average five kilos of agrotoxic farms in the world, today Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse, in use and consumption.
I wanted to understand why, but the answer is because our current society.
And don't worry about eating intoxicated vegetables, inverted values, allergic reaction, because they don't know the origin of chemistry, they don't know what kind of chemistry there is, why is that?
So, I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because when you buy, for example, a pack of leface, a pack of organic leface, you're paying, not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that, behind that leface, there was someone who took care of all care, with all affection, and took this leface until you don't invest in health, and we respect nature.
(Laughter) That's why I...
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food in terms of distribution is not efficient, I fell in love with cooking and nutrition.
It's simply overwhelmed, thrown away.
We ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason is a bad distribution policy, she lives in S√£o Paulo.
And if I took her, I put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue.
I think that, in fact, it's very important, so it's at the end to have almost a fivepe, but because it doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of nourishing, of feeding yourself, and I'm sure it's to be very scared, walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a pizza piece, for example.
So, these feces of food, these fast food food, were made for that same thing, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking on our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we end up opening space to the street, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little jewels, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of waste of sugar, which are the three industrialized products in excess, it's very harmful, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a physical dependency, but also a mental dependency, a physiological dependency, but it won't feed you.
And the one here who's still a cake, instead of buying that little pack, OK... Metade half... (Laughter) Who here still makes a pick of panel, a few bottle in the place of microwonds, look... half a half... (Laughter) Metade, the book!
(Laughter) This question may seem like these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the pump of bread for the microonds pump, it's a packaging, which could be a waste at least in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrialized products is very harmful.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think this food dynamic is a lot, this food system isn't healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook.
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health.
cooking brings independence, brings self-awareness, brings autonomy, brings freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
And I hope it's not an industry.
(Laughter) Because they don't cook, it simply process food, so if you let the industry feed you?
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, chicken dog.
What about a pizza?
And there's the discipizza because we don't even pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe that we ...
Keep the rice and the bean, guy, in leaving frozen for the rest of the week, I think there are many people who don't care, who don't have appreciation in the kitchen, who think that doing very thick food, gathering with a fresh street where you have a bean ready in the pressure panel, or there is no ready meal.
This would be perhaps at the same time that you'd take to wait for the puppets to arrive.
To wait or twice as Pizza.
(Laughter) So I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: men, women.
There is no age, no sex, girl, elderly, child, adult, sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, by changing education, we teach children, taking their children to fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to discharge a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic view of the world, and they will know where food comes from, because many people think they come from the supermarket shelter, so the children go.
independent growth of the dynamic industry of food, we have to change our value so that we have to value the food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking, education isn't just talking, please, thanks to license, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Right?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
There are fewer hospitals, this is education, education, prevention, so?
The future of food?
And it will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing well food is choices we can make to change the world for better, thank you.
Life is not here for us to live.
AC: But is it that we wake up?
And how do you wake up to tell?
Being here deeply, to talk about the power of transforming stories, is to go through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family is to be here, I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to the family parties.
My grandfather, Mario G√ºeyce, was the first mechanical trigo planter in Brazil, here in Buti√°'s land.
For me, and then, he got married with my old grandmother, and after having had my five siblings, I arrived in this world, happened yesterday, but, at 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are, and by telling them, we also transform ourselves, before looking at this future, we need to see who came behind and honoring stories all.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked to write a book called "scatterinhos," about products, this book helped me to experience mourning, and I went then to have complained and if I told this story, to me, brings one of the most beautiful things about it, that I needed to expand, which is the power that I knew all this world here, that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx, and I left because I had to do with the theme, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying, because that's what he's always suffered, and he wanted to share the story with the others, but I do you.
(Laughter) While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of badness and always had a lot of complaint with the right.
Above all that had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can take responsibility of who they are, as we've already said here, without fear.
And he, who was understanding this, was changing everything, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and he transformed into telling his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly, about acceptance and family.
It was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know who know him, I've also seen that the roof they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defeat, and, just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story, many people.
If he welcomes her story, the last week, he sent me an audio saying that many boys have been looking for him even more in the air.
The time that is so caring for dialogue and acceptance, to tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, and I hadn't taken this to people in a way that didn't have any shame, so I had to tell stories to me.
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, from everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we hear each other, we transform each other, and for me there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years, training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about asking a question to the audience, tells something funny, shows your children's picture, but, in fact, I think this isn't the most important thing, and if there's no formula, there's a big rule for me.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage, and it's not the roof that courage has a heart.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, √°vio, the professor of the Education University of Jerus beyond, he researched listening, and we spent months preparing his speech at the A√ßador's TEDx.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
One day, two weeks before his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this."
But every time you tell me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: how much, in fact, you have to get out of here, you have to be your heart, and it has changed everything.
He came at the day, and he gave an incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how it was the fact that he had been listened to when he needed it, when he thought about "suicide" when he had cancer.
What made him study about this, because he told me, and we're afraid to change, we're afraid to change, even though the most spoken word is that we'll change, and we've seen this today, that when we listen to truth, but who's worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell, we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and how knowledge we always get there and say.
I won't even listen to ourselves and to others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have a minute to look at each other, to come to embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time for people.
Because we're worried about our lives, we always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
And this, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
AC: But.
That's it.
MA: And empathy?
(Laughter) There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to tell you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the variest stories I heard, abroad.
We have yes, when she taught me that we need to look yes to the problem of street residents, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give, when they ask us something, we have, at least, a smile, and it doesn't cost anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and realize that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others truly, we transform ourselves.
And if the other listening and tells it also transforms itself, and, in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip. (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today, and he asked me, "Man, after all, why do you like to do this, why are you doing this?"
I'd like to free many of the people I know, from the room of flaws, flaws of values, the kitchen of uncertainty, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to give them faith in life.
Liberating fear, I wanted many people I know, at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and go back to smile, tell the right to cry, to say that they have the right to change faith in some humans, to say that they have the right to change and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
Audience: Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, being told to me, I don't belong to many spaces, or you may say there are judgments, where there are all sorts of stars, and stars, they don't have labels or classifications, they are only belonging to their plurial spaces, there isn't this fat or thinner lag, beautiful, rich and poor, and they're only legacted to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, from the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
So, why are we here below, so small, we couldn't produce something so simple, that is acceptance, empathy, the universe is infinite, and, along with it, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, the universe is infinite.
And this is rich, this exchange, so I want to ask you a request: I want you to allow, from today, to know something different from you, to allow yourself, so that's why we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from you.
Before starting my gender transition, I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in that process the bathroom, for me, was a doll ball, where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, or where I questioned God, the why I was different.
Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend.
He was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I just wanted to shake my head and dance rebels, because I've only woke up until today.
Audience: Yes.
But the question is: what was in the bathroom, that wasn't in the other places, and that was denied to me, from then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad, and when you enter a jester, you would spend some time there and leave a beautiful ballot.
It's because of this process, it has painful phases, and not everyone is standing to deal with it. It's difficult when you're very in empathy in this world, this path is harder, we go through many tests daily, in case of us, trans, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They get bothered by their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come here, do you go after yourself, our new thing, there's no crossing faces, no, you're staying, you're going to pass?"
Folks, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's a magnifying glass here who wants to see this one.
As a blind man has his life expectancy, of 76.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
And I wouldn't choose that.
I said, "So?
They question this and question the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chances of dying of being murdered, more than a man executed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, my art, as a form of deconstruction of pre-established ideas about me, makes the 21 people who were killed in the nest state, I saw myself speaking about a life experience for many people, not only an option, I found myself who I was, because I finally found who I was, who exhibited this novel for more than one million people and the main character of their own story.
It's a responsibility, bro!
It's a very big responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be fair to all that I represent with it.
That's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
Even if in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they'd say, "They've been filled with comments as a capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die, and there's no price."
What has no price is to receive message from mothers from other trans, thank me, for teaching them more than their own daughter.
Or better, receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shining, thank me for seeing me there and seeing me, this has no price.
To understand the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
I also understand that I don't want to be only three transitions, but I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm far beyond that, I'm much beyond strange.
But to understand this, I take the post of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the difference agrees.
The sky is the refuge of allies human beings, who was me, an alarm, a full of blue immensity, freedom without limits, me and the sky and me.
I've already took away from my courant, no longer looking, I don't play to stop, only what's left of their scars.
But the future, what the future promises, which brings my soul, is what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I'm going to fly, I've cried, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm an advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, along with working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
One day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly to get tumors, you won't take a fool." Well, it had been called with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
I took the courage, I had never been hospitalized, at no point, and it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and noted, in the same yesterday I stayed with the children with cancer, and I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "There is no visibility pain."
(Laughter) So I asked her to give me her hand.
Until I slept, I cut only after the room.
I used cancer, measures and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because, after all, I'll do it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter) So ...
I searched for information in a safe place, and I started looking for information on the hospital website, and the only thing that was the safe information at that time was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information that sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how will you engage with someone, if you can't often say the word "canscer."
And I was stubborn.
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized that society's information so that they donate hair, in fact, it wasn't for me, piruque was for them, that it wasn't able to see me as a doll.
With that, I went to see several other information that I thought wasn't the best ones.
When I entered the hospital, a blunt, the children said, "Wow, you launched your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer," "What doesn't take, okay, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a glass and a toothpaste brush, but also a shampoo, a burrow and a slope.
And I didn't have hair.
(Laughter) And this for my information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, so they showed me, sent videos, working, chemotherapy, passing through the radio, several procedures, until I didn't do, they taught me.
Things we were playing, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused a lot of hair fall, because it killed cells that doubled rapidly, but not only the tumor cells doubled rapidly, but also the hair cells, they could still say, "Oh, it's working!
We decided to open an NGO, and we opened BABA, which is cancer BABA, what we did, normally those who use health information, are health professionals, advertising professionals, but we started to engage children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought we could improve, what we had doubts, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but, with something very important, sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love you with the heart, you drawings, ventricular.
I think it's good, so we started doing this, and with this, children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide, this guide is to distribute for children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year if there's a sponsor in the audience.
AC: For year, we have 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zel√¢ndia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and the guide requests in northeast, because children and parents are often illiterate.
The information is very important, and sometimes information isn't just that thing, information technology, not only that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent in a kit, that if necessary to have information about everything, for example, there's no chemotherapy, it's in palliative care, or there's no moment.
When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, wet, sad child, you'll sell a lot more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at Biabaque website, this doesn't have.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient, how many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problems at home, will I still go to this internship, I want to take her to the hospital to see what's a difficulty?"
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need help, you only have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
We do information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
To help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependence, I hear a quote, "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, this isn't easy because dependency here gives me a disease and a brain disease, and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Laughter) What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought about various things, and one of these things is in our own organism: one of these defense is in our brain, it's called packaging emaccophalic barrier, despite being a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of our brain, and that make bacteria that viruses and substances that don't enter our brain and don't do bad for our head.
Unfortunately, drugs manage to contain this barrier, they're very small molecules, and because they're very small, they have an almost free passage through the sterfallic barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the reward circuit, in another circuit.
AR: We also have another protection system which is very important, which is our immune system.
AC: Our immune system is composed by anticorpos cells and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances, too, in this video, you can see the macrofogo and neutralize it.
So, could we not gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are inactive, which are us?
A few years ago, we started discussing these issues, until the day some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs quantities, producing anticope against their own drugs.
It's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
And then, from this point, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the barri√®re to help these patients?
(Laughter) My team and I?
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to reach a molecule, in fact two, a message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person to gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our immune system, produces anticpios and anti-colpes are big molecules, and then, that problem that the medical barrier has to let the drugs go freely, it no longer exists, because when the user consumes drugs in our body, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and pum, it no longer passes on the barrier of mate, you speak.
Look at this image here, how is this process beautiful, OK?
Here, the right of you?
We have a while that we haven't received the vaccine, once we were able to imunize them, and you can see, on the left side of you, there's a significant diminution of white dots in the animal's brain, when these rats are not immunized, they receive this cocaine that passed by, they stopped passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was parared, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rates have a much greater concentration in blood than the rates that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking the passage, they're arrested in a blood tissue.
The other interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency, so what our group is working now is, in fact, to help people gain freedom.
(Laughter) Those who know, in some time with a vaccine, they will be able to have time to decide a time to gain freedom again and discuss with themselves if they want to use drugs or not, thank you very much.
Uoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Invisible, the air in the wind.
I'm being.
A psychotherapist.
More than 40 years ago.
And I want to tell you that...
Besides.
Danorose.
Narrator: Malen?
Psychosis.
There's a tooth disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who has already infelelelelled, lost, and me.
We call it "normal."
Politrogenics of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
To have this great encounter, to have this TEDx.
In Sapura.
It's here.
No, music is being.
It was stunned from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some way.
In some way.
The war?
Legal, for example, is an example perhaps the most mortifier than ours.
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important part of the norm is systemic, systemic Situation.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that the norm has not always existed.
Namornosis is a typical disease, and it won't always exist in moments.
Where do we live in a context?
Where does it predominate?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, not of corruption predomina.
Dehumanity, in its word, egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapts to a sick and mutant system?
I've been.
Is it a worker?
It's been more than 30 years since.
from the International University of Paz.
Or the Uniasium.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes ... a little bit of payment.
What military for peace?
But for other areas.
Weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The healthy person is the one who has the capacity to present symptoms.
Sintomas with you?
Sometimes even.
A conscious despair, lucid.
Is it an indignation?
Just like that.
This reminds me of it.
From a family shell, when my daughter Isabela was five years old, and today she has 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What is the princess you like most?"
Gataweira, Cinderela?
The fallen asleep?
She thought and answered.
And I like all the maid's writing.
And I too.
And I too.
And I respect many people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the safety of feeling in your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive, who captured, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is the fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests.
And being deertified, these people would dismay.
My respect is the world.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
People considered crazy, are also considered safe.
Because they are like a rule that captures the cultural contradictions.
Sistendic, and sometimes I fail.
And how did I say it?
Singue?
The difference between them.
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And don't talk.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call "siquatic," are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an ins√¥nia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here, from Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing, he's good.
He's target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
He went back to lunch.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this meeting.
That nothing against certainty?
At that moment, "Hi!
That you suffer a desire too.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo, racism, homophobia.
Of various?
Exclusions.
Namorphosis!
We could talk about smoke, but it's environmental.
The girlfriend of another specialization, a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
No, no.
And that the gap salt catches the fire and each one is looking at the minimum, mine and dies, and it doesn't realize that its existence in the sense, we are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about that.
I was going to apply the generalist.
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe there's a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
It's finishing.
As it's a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The wish that brought us the incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage.
That's what we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just by Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can tell if you didn't tell her to lose.
"So? What do you mean?
A foundation of norms?
It's the context.
There's another one.
This is very important.
It's an evolution that has also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves.
What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us?
Money.
A bird from a snake, from a box?
I ask a friend, "Wow, there's a space."
Is it a Nobel Prize, alternative, economy?
From the developing country, mother was Max, Nife, Chile.
When I met the youngest, he told us that since the boy, he wanted to know that human beings interested in other species: intelligence, language, no, it's culture, no, it's humor, no.
And one day, talking to his father, that very respectful one, his father says, "It won't be stupid!
He heard a little light, and said he became the first stupid.
Comupidology is science that we need to study.
It differentiates, for example, of imbiciousity, who is it?
Audience: Yes.
That's absolutely...
One day, I like to remember the rulenter, the creator of biodiction, a great brother, and she told us that it should be a hipotalic idiot, be a good animal, from holidays to the chest that will be brave.
The question is stupid because it reversed with rationality, a person can be highly rigid and highly.
Rational.
To have qualified diplomas and universities.
And to do it as a person who is talking about sophisticated development, with graphs, tablets, as a person sitting on the branch of a tree laughing.
"So? What do you mean?
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had it.
Two infinite things.
The universe is human stubbornness.
And he agreed, "Yes, autism, in relation to a universe I still have."
But I need to say that I agree.
They are pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of Einstein's rules and Max Nefing, although they respect us and considering that the human being ...
We are born to be, to flourish, it's not your nature, stupidity, on the contrary, to serve, then.
I prefer to think of comfort.
Human beings were born, that by 2600 years said that what differentiates our species of other species is the inaccabulation, it's completely, we become humans.
A turtle is born, tortured, you've ever seen and go to the sea,
We are born unpleasant to say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas, or to be in Juras?
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, about developing emotional intelligence, unitical intelligence of dreams, of learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
To develop consciousness of where games, values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it like this.
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50 I knew what the precets of the center were.
At 60, I heard sweet invitation.
In the 70s, I could follow the instructions of my own heart, because what I wanted wasn't that day, the borders of justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
They told us, 2,000 years ago, you exchange clothes in 5 million, it takes to be an entire existence to exchange roots.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The norm refers to an evolutionary establishment.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the contrary, the question is: Is it the 21st century for human beings?
And nothing less than that ends up with this frame.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
Darwin didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being, where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, when to serve.
Someone asked for the IT.
Tell God.
And IT.
Thank you.
Maybe there's only one way.
about the mystery, the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially?
I am.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we hear doesn't happen to you.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned us about this story.
It was once.
What?
A forest.
Not to give up.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let it flow!
who picked up a source, an water drop and played in the middle of the fire and returned, resiliently, another drop.
He would play in the middle of the fire, and return with patience.
The lines already burned.
Do you think that with these ridicles, the beija-flor, I was playing in the middle of the man, "A Tartufo Jo√£o vendo that," said, "Well, silly, you'll turn this infernal fire?"
I've already been the answer, "I know it isn't.
I'm faced with everything.
Now, I'm doing my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes, with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way, because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little of peace, a little of order, a little of love.
In this small part of the world, where does the big world trust each one of us, and if we don't do that, where can we be facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions.
And ... failed and kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
You want to breathe, a concept, right?
I reach another, with others, with the world and aestheticspe, I recommend a book to the conspiracy of Corean de Marilyn Fex.
These spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a ground sloth radio.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stand up and we can do our part.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came, each of us talking about their water had water.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, in what you're on this stage, but on the stage, there's your life story.
Telling your story.
And taking them?
Your water drop because we can always turn a candle instead of just complaining the darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Our family.
I grew up.
We stretch.
Comassive love and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Cecillia Merentes.
Renova.
Take a look at yourself.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed the eyes they had seen, created others for other visions.
Both arms that had this remote.
For you to forget the colher.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
But always: lower.
Always far.
And inside.
That's it.
I entered a good school.

Tiriboas, no.
choose the job that will define you for the rest of your life, as a child as a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, an advertising, or a billboard, since my first one has a income.
I chose a university of resignation, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the minimum effort.
I received a curse.
I was a multinational company that didn't recognize me by their family.
I'm 3,000.

A continuous feeling of mutation, the void that passes at the mall on weekends can't applause anymore.
The shock is a pleasure antenna that, if it goes so soon, the marketing lake is broken, seen the shirt.
The baby is socially up every day.
The first apartment I had on the beach, ansiolithic, antidepressants, a void.
The middle school crisis, the meeting with my college colleagues, my God, as the years went fast, life is short.
My son in school, my God, as they grown fast, is the hidden life.

The continuous fear of losing a job, today doesn't value the most experience: the complete disconnection with your children decorating from the 12 hours of work field for decades.
The empty retirement surrounded by useless and unhappy things.
You're a winner, this is your only consle, your life as an executive executive.

Thank you very much.
