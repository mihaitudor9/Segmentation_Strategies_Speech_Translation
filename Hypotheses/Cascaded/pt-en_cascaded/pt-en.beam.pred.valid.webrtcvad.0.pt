(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
It said that the true character of a society is revealed by the way I portray their children.
But in Brazil we're living a paradox.
Our children are what we have of more precious, we want their well-being at any cost, we'll give our lives for them, and, however, our children come from very maltratized to society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and it requires us to propose changes, which is what I hope to do with you today: if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which are the majority, according to Mandela's critics, we are a terrible character, because we deny them based on basic goods such as health, housing, education, food.
In your social position, well-carded children, children and daughters of you who are here, we offer her prison.
We're going to get something that doesn't work well either. We make mistaken crimes - I want us to do a small trip about the seven capitals that our society is beginning against childhood.
The wave of Gabriela, a typical middle class child.
Gabriela's mother wants a natural birth, here is the moment of link, of affection with her daughter, to receive with her husband, this baby who will be born, and she starts to attend pre-natal medicine, and, quickly, the hospital medical industry, convinced me that I best for her is accessible.
I remember that, of course, there are necessary cests for each one of these sines that we'll be, a highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces C-section culture, a culture that makes women believe that normal birth must be accessible, that normal birth is in dangerous, dangerous, for example, in Rio de Janeiro, 93% are made.
We are criticizing exaggeration, which is unnecessary, what is lying, the same way happens with a maternal milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but I've already left maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there, is strong, the same way happens with a maternal milk.
The child is crying, so he's weak, in two months this child is dismantled, and she loses the wonders that breast milk can offer, and this comes a great part because of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to advertise to the consumer, but it spreads itself by the names it gives to forms, they awake.
He quickly expressed, and the mother milk is good, he's breastfeeding, but the privileges of my love, and seeking through the sincere mirror, which is the proportion of natural launching and breastfeeding, serious health problems in children, mothers, and that are even reflecting in adult life, that science is discovering now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the license, she'll have to go to the crew because she can't take care of vovement.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay a maid, and they end up exchanging, we end up exchanging Brazilian traditional food, which is wonderful, which is a rich food in fat, saturated fat, huge salt and sugar, crocantes out, all the weapons that the media despreced from childhood, the interaction is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, love, the feeling of being at home with this person, and we are taking care of our children, and we are taking care of our children, and we are taking care of our children.
Because they're chats, from the intoxication of childhood, which also brings serious problems, this peculiar of childhood intoxication, which also brings serious problems: it has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run around, go out, and even if we want to provide food, we manage healthy food.
However, in our urban lives, they don't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave the child, they get home, stay home, stay home, we play team games, it was an incredible moment, so children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, that's each one of us, and they can't give something in the car.
(Laughter) Even in the moments she needs the most of awareness, that's what we offer her, in awareness, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this does, Gabriel watches four hours on TV per day, she's massacrated by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because in school it spend more time for us, creativity and imagination, and we're breastfeeding this for less time in school.
And then, at the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, no, she doesn't go to the stool, the family does the classic show of the Brazilian family in the weekend, which is...
Very well, where it will be more massacrated by obesity, for toxic values, toys, care, and brands, according to taste, and that instills in it values like an obsessive consumerism, the hypervalonization of the appearance.
The utility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, will disagree, even in alcohol consumption, we know that beer in Brazil is not alcoholic drinks, not people, this peculiar of the mercantilization of childhood and child consumption.
Cabrela is full of commitment because her parents want that to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda is full of compromises, to relax this stress, they add a meditation class, but she could meditate in the little square, people, at the balancing, the wonderful thing, who has no longer meditated in the balance.
Look at the sky, look at the floor, look at the floor, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, "Merudization, Ronga is money with another class," and then it will be exposed to this.
That uses seven or eight-year-old kids to sell fashion products, meradization, which is based on sexism, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the Association of Sexuality.
Gabriela has peace that is afraid of her, because she doesn't live with her, so instead of limiting, they put them in a trono, she goes to be the queen of her family, and not a member of her family anymore, she starts deciding the programs, the cardboard, if she's going bad at school, the guilt of the school, we have to talk to her teacher.
She gathers a lot, if what she needed would be presence.
And she realizes that she is more and more that her parents don't have the authority: a child, sometimes, two or three years old, who realizes that their parents don't have the authority, and we need people who lead their lives, this leads to anxiety and generates symptoms, and we interrupt ourselves between the experience of their children and the world.
They don't have life experience, so they don't develop ways to deal with frustration, pain, difficulty, and certainly everybody will deliver them later, this is the sin.
From the intronization and the superpower in childhood: OK, in front of so many problems, of course childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, stiggered, birty, and will get sick, will eat too much, it'll be obese, it'll be ill in school, it won't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about this, it's not possible for these children like this, the same way we take these poor children and put in the chain the solution we're not going to give to bad behavior children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think of this context, not, medicalization, we'll give them medicine, late to prepare them to behave well, this is called medicalization, and it's the worst of the animals.
Going to the doctor, the doctor sees they're sick, receives the medicine, they go home, buy a medicine in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here in truth.
What the parliament is that it is producing exactly medicine, and that's what we're doing for our children, not only with the alienate children, the adults also in a very arregonous way, the medicalization of phenomena, 15% of the children today are setting pregnancy, with this individualistic society.
The three employees are the market that grows the most for depressants, who are arriving at this point, and Ritalina, the way for medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and hyperactivity, sold in 1999, 70 thousand boxes, in 2010 more than 2 million boxes.
But for every problem, the complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
Obviously, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is a solution that passes only by changes of two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And in relation to time, what we can do when we talk about sines, we're talking about penitence and penitence today means "that disabled payment," in almost all churches, the d√©cimo is to give a part of what we have of most precious for our childhood, which is our sacred, what we have of most precious today, right?
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of surveillance, it's a seven-hour point that we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes, this gives a bigger and 40 a day, it's not much, it's possible, it's only to priorize, and if it doesn't happen during the week, we start with a good cat to live.
Sexualize this place.
(Music) How would it be?
You can open your eyes, tell me if you fit in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure that most of you, yes, this shows little importance of nature, it's not a doctor, hospital, medicine, it's all these factors, we know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience. I started with Patricia who, back then, wasn't giving me my presentation, she said, "Wow, but you're a favor of an incredible thing."
I talked about the convergence to auditability: I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature to the environment.
Everything that causes health does the environment well, and vice versa: riding a bike, does the body well, my cities, bottles, pollution, collective transport, does well for the time of conviviality, reduces pollution, with nature, probably said, with an open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it will cut us off the fabrics, it will give us moments of awareness, especially for children, who will know each other and learn how to deal with them, we will develop empathy, to promote contact with the air, and the green that produces good to be physic, psychological and mental well-being, and it will reduce all childhood problems.
accessible and welfare grounds, all of this is called occupation of a city. It's the word occupied, practically used for resistance and citizens today, it means to occupy public space with joy.
And, mainly, taking part in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as it happened in S√£o Paulo, where you're seeing here, in a photo of Represa Billings, a source of water from S√£o Paulo, 30 to 40 years ago, and today.
In the mago-vernance and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they returned, and people demand, acting with public interests, with their sustainability and equity.
The same scientists, who announce a terrible environmental crisis, that's coming here, will come very early, our children will get me in, and they also say, in 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing the inequality of what we already know, with transparency and pay attention, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's nice to participate in this.
Unfortunately, this year, he said that utopia is on the horizon, the more I get closer, the more it moves away, if we take a thousand steps, it pushes a thousand steps, then, taking children to nature, already abroad, let's make them look after others, and we'll reduce inequality, exactly to make us walk, to make us walk abroad.
(Applause)
In 2007,
I came across a great group of young people and adults with disabilities.
Listening to regular education.
And since then?
What's my biggest challenge?
It was to look and see the many efficiency of these people so marked by their disabilities.
So I created the project "Caf√© terapeutic" which is the group of parents, students and friends in search of a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion within school.
With their parents, with their children and their partners.
People with disabilities are very marked by those they can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they show this to their parents.
For community and for society in general.
People with disabilities are sometimes left aside, they stop having friends.
Because they think they are not capable.
to have friendships.
to feel like acting with people.
Here is the case of the student Igor, for example, who in the other school he studied?
For four years he didn't get into the classroom because he couldn't interact with his friends and teachers.
And people didn't have the strength to do that either.
Throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all kinds of physical education.
And since he loved running, he ran all the time.
(Laughter) When I got to the Seja Campulimpo, I sought to know Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what his interests at school.
And what together could we do?
So that he could ...
They achieved better learning.
The school?
A paradise was a place of despair.
[A.DE.]
Well, you already know it's a thumb?
Today, he's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends, he says I'm the best friend of him.
And for two years consequently, he presented me on the day of his parents.
And I believe that school goes much beyond writing, mathematics and reading.
The school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And they can teach students to enjoy their own learning process.
The schools think they are not able to attend these students and that they are prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
I need to use and believe that these children are capable and that they are inside the school.
To do well for them, it's going to do good for other students, for the school community and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of learning others.
Why is the choice like that?
There's what I know, what you know and what we can learn together.
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years conviving with disabled people?
I learned to appreciate my view.
They survive with people so they can see it.
I learned to use my hearing, living with people who don't hear, I learned to value my legs with those who can't walk.
(Laughter) I learned to value my ideas, with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
The most important thing I learned was to value my heart.
And the heart of my students: to create connections and bonds of friendship.
And what's most important for society?
It's learning the exercise.
With empathy.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
(Audience) Yes.
I always liked eating a lot, but I never went to cook.
When I was a child, I loved seeing my grandmother, a cook.
I cook, work in the kitchen, she who took into account the Christmas seeds, in the new, P√°scoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked to throw their hand with her, in fact, it was my brother, so much that she asked me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?"
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, it's more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, someone transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
Food as a form of prevention and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine itself.
Which is zen, care and respect for nature.
So I decided that we could ...
Changing the way we are.
To build the food system through food.
And I believe that...
One of the side effects of modernization is the distancing of man with nature, the distancing of rural life, so I believe we are people.
Tross√© is a little of life.
We can strengthen the connection between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can connect with nature.
(Applause)
Years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with cooking, fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
Food, food, as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in terms of health, but also to improve.
To a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we...
It's to do it.
To restore the food system.
Changing the food dynamic, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the meat process, for example, there are two principles that lead to meat production on the industrial scale.
The more we produce, the cheaper we produce, the quantity and speed.
The worst is quality.
The biggest is the cost of the environment and the animal's life cycle, is artificially accelerated and for our health in terms of speed, the animal cycle is artificially accelerated.
He ...
He loses, he begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies arrive an hour that doesn't end up, and he begins to lose damage the quality of life, his health, and his life time.
I believe we can and must change this food system. I was passing the other day in the supermarket and I realized that Franco's kilo was cheaper than tomato's kilogram, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex, right?
This didn't enter my mind.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the production process at the industrial scale is also very - let's say it's harmful for our lives, for our health and the environment, because, today, Brazil is the world's biggest consumer of agrotoxic farmers.
Each Brazilian consists of 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount ... (Applause)
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxic benefits, but, even so, they keep tolerating this abuse, in use and consumption.
(Applause)
I'd like to understand why, but the answer is because our current society ...
There are inverted values, there is an investment of values, why does a person worry?
And don't buy a failed perfume because they think there'll be some alertical reaction because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what chemistry there is inside.
And don't worry about eating a intoxicated vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people how to value organic products, because, the more you buy, for example, a pill of leface.
It's a bit of organic leface, you're paying not only you're investing, many times, you don't know that behind that leface, there's someone who has taken care of all the love and affection and took this leface to you, so we pay for the producer's well-being, we invest in health and we respect nature.
That's why I...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
And in terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think - right?
You must know that we produce lots of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply desperated, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why are people still suffering from hunger, and the reason...
It's a bad distribution policy, we have to revert this.
In terms of consumption?
It's also the way we consume food today is scary, my grandmother is Pulist, she lives in S√£o Paulo.
If I took her and put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure she's very scared, seeing those executives or those depressed people walking on the street, talking on the cell phone, swimming a piece of pizza, for example, because she also doesn't recognize it as a form of mealing, as a way of synchronizing to feed.
And it's ...
So ...
These feces of food, these fast foods, were made for this same thing, so that we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little jewels, biscuits and stuff also have many chemical additives, and an exaggerated level of "salgo-duria√ß√∫car," which are the three altrugicious, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a physiological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products are too harmful, I don't even call them food, for me, they are made up of food, because you can even consume, satisfy, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panel popcorns, panickets in the place of microwaves, look...
This question - (Laughter) This might seem these two questions, may seem a little harmful, not saying anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange bread's popcorn for the microwaves' popcorn, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you'll be consuming.
So I think that the excessive consumption of food is excessive, I think that for us to talk, to summarize this question of the chemical process that you wouldn't put, I am certainly sure, in your packaging, and you're also polluting with packaging.
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not sweet, it's not...
You're not working and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is returning to the fuel.
To cook...
It's synonymous of art, culture, leisure, health, cooking brings safety, bringing independence, bringing self-awareness, bringing freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, will someone cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry... (Laughter) Because they don't cook, the industry doesn't cook, they simply process food.
So, if you let the industry feed you ...
She'll choose for you what you'll have for dinner: lazen, frozen, frozen battle, hamburgers, or fallen dog.
What about a pizza?
(Sigh) So I believe we're going to give the disciple, because not even little we know how to do more.
(Sigh) Oh no, man.
Where is the rice and the bean, where is the beij√£o rhythm of each day that filled our belly and our soul?
I think there are a lot of people who don't care, who don't appreciate the kitchen, who think that making food is very worky, it's very anti-pathetic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave the mold bean from night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes you have a bean ready on the pressure panel, or you can simply pick up one day and make a bean.
And letting it frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with the street and little box you do in 28 minutes, the legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when it came from the fair, and half an hour you have the ready meal, this would perhaps be the same time you'd take to wait for peers to arrive.
Spering or delivering of Pizza.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, women.
And elderly, boy, girl, child, adult.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children, bringing the children to the fair, to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, wash the dishes.
Simple things from everyday life, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic view of the world, they will know where food comes from.
There are many people, I think it's from the supermarket shelter, so the children go ...
independent growth of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutical industry, because they will get less sick, growing up eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change.
The dynamic ...
In food, we have to change ours ...
Our value we have with food, we have to value food more, value the act of eating more.
And cooking, education is not just talking, please, thanks to license, education.
Isn't that mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food, so that we have less hospitals, that is education.
It's education and prevention, so ...
The future of food...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choose foods?
These are choices we can make.
To change the world for better.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Life is not the one we lived.
But it's the one we wake up and talk about.
Do you know who's deep down?
To talk about the power of transforming stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because a large part of my mother's family is to be here.
I came here, as a child, to spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My torment, Mario G√ºeyce, was the first blind planter.
Tlavora mechanized in Brazil, here in the land of Buti√°.
For me, and then, he got married with my old grandmother and had seven children, inside them of my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five siblings.
I arrived in this world, by chance, was yesterday, but, at 50 years ago, it's the stories we tell, that make us who we are and by counting, we transform ourselves and listen.
And it also transforms, we want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history, before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who came back and honored, all stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early: I always liked writing, reading, telling ...
In the school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how it had happened.
This book helped me to live mourning, and I know it helped a lot of people too, so I had told it, and, if I told this story, for me, brings one of the most beautiful things about it, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in each other's history, they feel in the color of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, because obviously somebody ...
Come on, you'll sit on your lap of this story and feel welcomed.
But then one day I met this world here, from TEDx, I met amazing people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood at 45 years that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories, because the publicity world had already been very small to me.
So I started to do this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago's, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago at TEDx.
About entrepreneurship with purpose, something as we ... but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying.
Because that's what he've always suffered -
And he wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with the theme, except that I water you.
While we were preparing to talk about him, he always came with a lot of mislead, and always a lot of complaints with the right, about everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, if it's to keep complaining about who did that with us, and, otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves and that they can accept who they are, as we've already said here, without fear?
And he, who understood this, was changing his tunnel, and on the day Tiago grew up on stage, and transformed himself to tell his story and speaking for the first time he was gay openly.
And he spoke with a lot of property about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this, because there wasn't only this transformation with him from people I know you know him.
Also, having seen that the root they imagined that Tiago had nothing more than a great defeat.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just as he welcomed himself, I'll tell him a lot of people's story.
Last week, he sent me a high-pitched saying he welcomes in his story.
That many boys have been looking for it even more in the air.
It's the time that is so caring of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that he wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And I hadn't taken this to people in a way that I didn't have any shame.
So, tell stories to me ...
That's what they cause micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but in my too, of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
For me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I've been working with this for seven years.
I'm bringing many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give news about how to start, about how I ask a question to the audience.
Tell something funny shows your children's pictures, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has color of heart.
That's it, right?
I told the story of "Ave," the audio, the teacher of the university is "brace" of boys beyond, and he researchs listening.
We spent months preparing his talk at TEDxLossador, and there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day, two weeks before everything.
From his talk, I called him on Skype and said, "That's all here, it's all here, and shows me your head, how much, actually, you have to leave everything from here."
It has to be our hearts.
And he changed everything.
And the day came, he gave an amazing talk about listening.
about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he was heard, when he needed the most, when he thought about it, this is a place when he had cancer.
What did he do?
I went to study about this.
And it was him who taught me that we are always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to tell, there are so many dictionary, writing courses, but who are worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me, and we've seen this today, how much do we really listen to?
We transform ourselves.
And we're afraid to change, we're afraid to change, although the most spoken word here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change, but let's change.
There's always this fear, and, like this fear, we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
What about us?
And for others.
And the listening ...
You see, also, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy.
But we don't have one minute to look at each other, to come embrace and say.
Another thing: we don't have time.
Other people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't learned to listen?
(Laughter) But this, after hearing his talk, got another TEDx back.
(Laughter) And empathy has another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that, in these seven years, there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most diverse things I heard, outside all the others ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) What empathy too, I learned collectivity, for example, is that when we say on the street, many of us, that we have nothing to give.
When do they ask us something?
We have yes.
At least, we have a smile.
And he doesn't take anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear, and we tell, that make us who we are, and when we listen, the other in truth, we transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listening and telling it also transforms itself, and in the middle of the crazy preparation, which was this process here for me, it was outside my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this, why are you doing this?"
Now, I'd help people.
And the answer to me ...
And for everyone, I came from a poem I myself wrote, that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To show her the key of her lives.
From the fourth of flaws, salas, values, the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
The right to cry, the right to change, to give them faith in life: faith, in some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change, the right to bitter, of not loving, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many of the people I know.
Liberating your story, which, despite being important, is not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, so they could look to the side and then smil, count and listen.
And you, what stories you'll tell about your lives, which stories you want to tell about you.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) It's because, in fact, I'm part of the true and step, they're only part of their plurial spaces, there isn't this fat or thin, beautiful, rich and poor.
It's only legacy to their existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that revealed over my life, a phase in which I was denied the right of just being.
However, resisting and existing has always been a life condition for me, since the moment I recognized myself, but respectfully, I don't look for acceptance and rights for life, when she was born.
So, why are we here, below, so small, so we couldn't produce something so simple, that is acceptance, empathy, and, precisely that reason, this poem wanted, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky?
And this is rich, this exchange, the different is beauty, it's incredible when we sit with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, that's why we have privilege and opportunity to be different.
So, I want to ask you a request, I want you to allow yourself from today to know something or someone different from you, to allow yourself.
(Laughter) Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
While starting my transition of gender, laughing, where I cried, the bathroom, the bathroom, for me, it was a hood ball, it was where I could be the same, it was where I always asked myself who I was or what I would be, and in that process, the bathroom, for me, was a hood ball, it was where I could be different.
(Laughter) But the question is: what was in the bathroom, that wasn't in the other places, and it was denied to me, "Well, the bathroom turned into a best friend, he was always there, after a day full of bullying, or when I only wanted to put the ball in my head and dance rebeldes, because I've only been back until today."
The best thing is why do I need to go to the bathroom to have this freedom?
The fact that I was different from that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, for lack of information?
And when it's about trans universe, this even more difficult path, I've researched on the Internet, but let's see people like me, during my 21 years old, more or less, I started to see friends of my transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me, today I want to turn into mistakes too, like this, everyone will come, so I think and started the wrong way.
So I started looking for my true decency, and I started to get tired, for example, by this process, it has painful phases, and, if you're a black, fat woman, this path is harder, we go through many proves every day, people think it's just a phase, it's as if you enter a label, spend some time there and leave a beautiful athlete.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But play, are you a drug dealers, our new thing? There's no traffic faces, no, you're fased, people, who are aware, choose the life expectancy of 35 years old?"
Is there any hall here who wants to live such a fifth and five?
While the man exists, he has his life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, choosing to live in the country that most kills transgender people worldwide?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, Antra, the National Association of Transvestis Women, said that we, trans women today in Brazil, have even 14 times the chance to die of being murdered, more than a man exiggered, and, second, if we compare with the United States, we, Brazilians.
Being a trans isn't an option, but, in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's no one... I take a calder and a little force, resistance, 35-year expectation, there's no one who was still like that, that we could better measure this panel, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a way of deconstruction of ideas, for the whole stability, not only trans people, I saw myself being a model, magazine layer, J, and "perform" and Thuber," in an immensive way that exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(End of video) (Applause) It's a great responsibility to talk about differences, for so many people, to represent a flag and be ugly to all that I represent with it.
But that's how I did it, abused, I went from my real name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all the subjects that would come out on me on the internet, they would say, "It's a comment book like a man who's capable, monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What has no price ... (English) What has no price?
(Applause) (Cheers)
What doesn't have a price is this baby message from other trans mothers, thank me.
To laugh, to teach them, more than your own daughter.
The best thing is to receive message from other trans girls, with their eyes shine, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
Three, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm much beyond that, I'm much beyond that, but to understand this, I have a stranging posture, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plurial beings, the aggregated differences, where people see the difference, something that can definitely change the world.
The sky ...
I refuse allies' beings.
Who was me, a loved one?
Inmensity, freedom without limits.
I and the sky, yours and me.
I don't look at myself anymore, I can't stop, I've already gotten away from my courant.
In the past, only what's left are the scars that mark my soul.
But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: being next to me, now I am, now I am, I'm going, I'll fly, let's see, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) I'm a advertising, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and following the children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, I couldn't often explain to children what cancer was, treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew I had an ovary score, that doctors called "teratoma," a beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open our belly to get tumors, you won't take a sixth grade."
Well, it had been called, but I saw that at the hospital I could operate, I was already used to doctors, nurses, and I decided to do the surgery there, I took courage, I had never been hospitalized, given point, nothing, in the same village I stayed with children with cancer.
The belly, I called the nurse, and asked, "Look, what did she say?"
Then I asked my parents to call me and she said, "There's been a visitor's pain."
(Laughter) So I asked her to give me her hand.
I even slept.
I cut only after the bedroom, I was with cancer, met√°ses, and committed gangs, I said to the children, "Don't Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, not when you're lucky.
So ...
I looked for information in a safe place, and I started looking for the hospital website, and the only thing that happened to me ...
What was safe information at that moment was that I was going to die because it was the most aggressive tumor and with a few chances of healing.
which sometimes didn't help, that didn't engage, and how would you engage someone if you can't even say the word "c cancer"?
And I was stubborn.
And opening what bothered me, forgot, threw me, but my friends were there for years to help me, and from that moment on, I realized.
Actually, the pyramid wasn't for me, this information of society for them to have hair.
I couldn't see myself as a doll, and with this I went to see many other information I thought wasn't the most suitable.
(Laughter) When I got to the hospital, a blunt, the children said, "Wow, you laughed your hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm like you, I've got cancer, I took you out," "What doesn't take, OK, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking a lot of things and telling about the procedures, when I went to put the catheter, because I did my therapy earlier, the first one had a job, I got a hospital kit.
Here at this kit, a sabonete came, a base has a seed of teeth, but also a shampoo, a towel.
And a slope.
I had no hair, (Laughter) This is information for me, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent kids to try to explain, "Look, you're going to pass through this, and what happened?"
(Laughter) So, they showed me, sent videos, worked, taking chemotherapy, passing through radio, various procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me, but you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why it'll find."
That would fall our hair down, but then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair falls, because it killed cells that quickly doubled, but not only the tumour cells doubled quickly, but also the hair cells, they still understood, "Oh, it's working and it began to engage children, and the doctors started to call me."
If there's a patient who will place cat√©ter, you can come here, and then I have a patient who will breastfeed a leg, you can come here, and I said, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have health professionals, advertisers, but you say that the information is focused on the patient, normally who likes someone and you write the theme with the heart."
(Laughter) I think no, so we started to do this, and with that, the children started to understand even more the processes: these terms left our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides a year.
If we have a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for year, 13,000 children diagnosed with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started asking children from New Zel√¢ndia, Japan, from several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese, but we have a translator, and the guide requests in Northeast because children and parents are often illiterate."
So the doctors ask and check the pages of the procedures the children will do, with that we started to dismiss and engage the patient.
Sometimes, information isn't just that thing, information technology, not just that thing, modernity, complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit, then what do we say and do we play?
That if you need to have information about everything, for example, I don't know if you know more about it when it's events, skinny children earn much more present and attention than cheerful children, but sometimes the doll child has already done treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes children have cancer because they don't have chemotherapy, they're in palliative care, or they don't have anything at some point.
(Laughter) And that sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that thing in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising student, and we know if we put a doll, discarded, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll get a lot more money, you can look at BABA website, and what happens with this, and when you're the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital in the bedroom, weak, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I still get to this internship, and you think, "I get a call from parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take her to the hospital to see what's difficult.
(Laughter) OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you already thought that inside this room there's a child, an adult, who, in the case, was me, that people would look to go through the window, to see, and father with my life is good, and when we need help.
You have information that puts you down.
So, I think it's very important for us to pay a little attention to this too, not only to patients for their society.
(Laughter) We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, I went to the hospital to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information so we can save many others, thank you.
(Applause) In my career as a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist ...
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I just don't stop what I don't want."
And, fortunately, this isn't easy, because the dependency here gives me disease in a brain disease and a disease that complicates the lives of people a lot.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, what if, in fact, the answer has inside us to treat chemical dependency, and if, in fact, patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these defense is in our brain, that can protect itself from great threats, the barrier kills cyphalic, although it seems a complicated name, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and brain veins, and that make these viruses and non-violent substances don't enter our brain, and don't do bad for our recompense circuit in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by cells, anticorposs, and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, virus and toxic substances as well.
(Laughter) So you realized that these people who used drugs a few years ago, we started discussing these issues until the day when some researchers in the United States, studying the people who end up using a lot of drugs, we couldn't gather these two things to help our patients?
To produce an antic√≥pe against its own drug, it's almost as if the immune system told them this way.
For this, it's not necessary for more drugs in the system, it's over-carded.
From that point on, we started to think how could we use this immune system and the serphalic barrier to help these patients?
(Laughter) I and my team.
A few years ago we've been researching, and in the last two years, we've managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorposs against drugs and we'll try to help this person gain their freedom again and control it.
How does this work, this substance enter our body, it makes our immune system produce anticpios and anti-ccophic molecules, and then that problem that the Maths barrier has to let go freely to drugs stop existing, because when the user consumes drugs, this tiny molecule, links to a large and pum molecule, no longer passes on the barrier in Mars, you speak.
Look at this image here how this process is beautiful, these white dots you can see, it's a cocaine molecule, marked with radiation, when these rats are not immunized, receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it passes freely and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
There is a significant decrease of white dots in the animal's brain, which indicates that, probably, this cocaine that passed away.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was stopping, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is without chemical dependence, so they get stuck inside the box, or more inhibited, that doesn't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
Maybe, in some time with the vaccine, they will be able to have time to decide, a time to gain new freedom.
To discuss with themselves, if they want to use "no use drugs," thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
A scout.
More than 40 years ago.
I want to tell you that...
Besides...
Danorose.
Besides?
In psychosis.
There's a tennis disease.
In fact, everything.
It's a nefasta disease.
who's already infileno, he loses, go.
What about me?
We call it "normal."
An atrogen of normality.
And I must say that...
And maybe these are one of the charming?
To have this great encounter TEDx?
Thank you very much.
It's here.
"Oh no, music is being."
Toting from the beginning.
What is ours?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doct of social consensus.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some way.
In some meditation.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Maybe it's an example.
The most deadly.
What?
It's a motor value.
Up to where I can understand, there are two fundamentals.
The most important ones.
Danormose in is the location.
Sistenic.
The other is evolution.
The system.
What's the context?
According to the fact that not always the norm has existed...
It won't always exist.
The norm is a typical disease.
At times...
What do we live in a context?
Where it predominates -
Violence ...
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dishumanity in its word.
Egocentrism.
So, to be normal?
This adapt to a sick system?
And keep it?
I've been.
A worker?
It's been more than 30 years since.
from the International University of Paz.
Or Unipas.
And people think that peace is good.
That peace is absence of conflicts, no.
"It's a good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the line, the Chinese wisdom, is thisgnancy.
How many wars ... I said, that comes ...
A bit of payments.
What military for peace?
But with other guns.
The weapons of the consciousness of responsibility...
of compassive love.
So ...
In the same way.
Health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes...
The person must, that one ...
that has the capacity to present symptoms.
Conscious symptoms.
Sometimes even...
A conscious despair, lucid.
An indignation?
Right?
This reminds me of...
From an appeal to the family.
When my daughter Isabela ...
Today she's 34, and she has a 8-year-old boy, she's five.
The mother asked her,
What princess do you like most?"
The ballet sheet, Cinderela?
The golden lower?
She thought...
And he answered, "What?
I like all the May's writing.
And I too.
I too.
I respect a lot of people who say more.
(Laughter)
Sometimes, because it is sensitive to feel in your own skin.
Add the contradictions.
That the Northetics don't feel.
People who sought me with panic illness, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say sensitive.
who captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it fear of the family system?
It's a fear of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel helpless.
Forests...
And these people have experienced being desertified.
I respect a lot.
People called psychoactics and neotics.
Not everyone has the ability to enlighten.
That's why, in Africa, people considered crazy ...
They are also considered many.
Because they are like a paragaia that captures.
The contradictions...
Culturate.
Sistenic.
And sometimes I fail.
And how did I say that?
Singue?
The difference between the ...
A seat on a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And it won't do it.
Maybe these people, at least in a large extent that we call ...
So ...
"Sequatic are saints failed."
I respect the neurons a lot, at least it has the defense of having a consensus pain, an ins√¥nia.
The problem is the girlfriend, it's us who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So I think of an occasion that I came to give a seminary here: Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, knowing that I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem at home."
My son is good.
She's kind.
He gets up by an older person sitting down.
He doesn't swing.
He's stupid.
It's the target of bullying.
People drop and ridiculate my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
I don't know if you understand.
What am I wanting for you?
He earned brothers.
So ...
I must say that all the people I have ...
I respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, as ...
This fabulous team that organized this meeting ... (Applause) And nothing against correctness.
(Laughter) At that moment, we have to suffer from unpleasantness.
So ...
You talked about norms, machismo.
From racism, homophobia.
Of various...
Exclusions...
"Moramose!"
We could talk about the norm, is it environmental?
The girlfriend does.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, (Laughter) who is a cut salt, takes the fire, and each one is looking at the least, takes me and doesn't realize, their existence in the sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person that is merely specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about...
Doing the appology of the generalist?
But it's not the computers' functions.
Maybe...
It's a concept.
In this education, which has also been ...
Very good.
How do I feel a solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
of the wish it brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what brings us on a stage like this.
It's because we're honoring a promise we made.
We live here.
Just by a Pik Nik.
We saw a story.
And only you can happen.
If you didn't count, it would offend.
So ...
A foundation of norms?
(Laughter)
The Situation took place.
It's another one.
Very important.
It's an evolution that has also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to ask ourselves.
What differentiates?
But a human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Audience: Yes.
Yeah.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I think of a friend of Ui Paz.
An alternative Nobel Prize, economy?
Mom was Max Life, a Chilean of developing countries.
When I met my illness, he told us that, since he was a child, he wanted to know where the human being was different.
Of the other species.
Intelligence: no, it's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, isn't it?
And one day, talking to his father, that world, respectable.
His father says, "It won't be stupidity, my end."
Chorus: Here.
(Laughter) It differentiates, for example, of the unbelievable, who sends a little light, and says that it's become the first estupidologist, stupidology, a science that we need to study.
(Laughter) That's absolutely...
And she told us that we need to be money, I like to remember the rulenter, the creator of biodiction, a great brother.
The hipotalic stupid, being a good animal, taking vacations to the chest Bral?
The question ...
It's stupidity because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly clear.
It worked.
To have diplomas and universities.
Olympics.
And to do like a person talking about development?
with graphs, branches.
Suphisticated?
Like a person sitting in the branch of a tree, closing.
So ...
"Nice," he also said.
That for him only had ...
Two infinite things.
What about the universe?
It's human stupidity.
And he agreed, "Yes, autism, in relation to a universe, I still have my doubts."
But I need to say that I agree.
From Einstein and Maxleyphing, although they don't spontaneously.
And considering what...
Of the norms they are pointing not to the species's characteristics.
Human beings ...
Isn't it from nature?
Comupidity, on the contrary, we are born to be, to flourish.
It will be said.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
Who said 2,600 years ago?
That what differentiates our species of other species is the inbalance, it's completely.
We are not born human.
We make ourselves humans.
A tartaru wasn't born and has never gone, have you seen and go to the sea?
We don't.
We are born unpleasant.
That's why I say confuse: human beings need education.
You've heard about...
School for tartarugas or...
(Laughter) You're helping.
Education is imperfection, we are imperfect, and it's not only about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems to be necessary to develop a rational demonstration.
It's just about...
Cultivate the dimensions of the soul's soul.
Emotional intelligence, unirical intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
Reveloping an alphabetization?
What's essential?
Discovering consciousness.
Where?
Jocuous values of ethics with heart.
The confuse itself.
He summarized it ...
Her long existence.
When I was 15, I guided my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40.
I didn't suffer from "perplexity anymore."
At 50?
I knew which were the precets of the sky.
Do you accept it?
I was listening to twelve invitation.
At 70.
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted wasn't that day anymore, the borders.
For justice.
How about therapists and Alexandria?
He told us, 2,000 years ago, you change clothes.
And five thousand, I'm led to be a whole existence.
It was to change.
How do you think?
And this is the task.
In that sense?
A nursery ...
It refers to an evolutionary intervention.
They're people who didn't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, on the other hand, the question is: will there be the 21st century?
Is it human beings?
Nothing less than that finds this paradox.
I don't fire everything.
From new ones.
Generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Give didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in human beings, but the human being ...
As Tiaxatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to orch, to serve.
Someone asked for the IT.
Say God.
And IT.
He said, "Yes."
Maybe there's only one way.
To talk about the mystery of the great wine.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
What potentially!
We are.
So ...
I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to "nonipas".
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned with us about this story.
It was once.
A forest.
I was incendiated.
And all the bugs flee, all of us.
Less, let flow.
who would take a source, an water drop, and play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned, resiliently, another drop.
I was playing in the middle of the fire, and I got back with patience.
The ants, the ants.
What a few friends already ...
I'd play in the middle of the man, "Hey, a push man, seeing that, said more, or see a soccer player?"
Do you think that with these ridicules?
Both girls, are you going to turn off this infernal fire?
I leave the flower and say, "I know I don't."
I tell you everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionaries.
People who are changing society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in an arrogant way.
Because hundreds are transformed.
It's not our task to change others nor the world.
Each of us is a little piece of public square.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little bit of peace, a little order, a little ...
of love?
In this little corner of the world, that the great world trust each one of us.
What if we don't do that?
Where can we be the facilitators of transformation?
That's why revolutions are very important.
And they continue to fail and fail.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
Can I do it with others?
Comundo and consistent.
I recall a book, "The Corean Department of Marily Fex."
who studied these spontaneous movements, institutional trances, from a vulgant rate.
The beija-flor has no ideology, he has no flags, he's not blaming anyone, I'm not pushing anyone, he is part of him.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part anyway.
Since the morning, I can see drums who came.
Each of us is talking about their water drop.
And all that is necessary, everyone.
At some point you'll be here, what you're on this stage, but on the stage...
You have your life story.
Telling your story.
and taking them back ...
Your drop had water, because always.
Can we turn a candle on?
Once again, it's complaining.
from darkness.
So, I want ...
I concluded saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because, when our mind is exhausted, our bullet goes up.
It's time.
of renewalization.
I love it.
Poets.
I grew up.
And we straighten up?
Love counts like this and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Ceciliia Mereus.
Renevant.
I went to Renato in Tedesco.
Multipicle having your eyes to see more.
Multiplicking your arms to CNRS all.
I closed my eyes, who had seen you, and created others.
For other visions.
Both arms that had this remote.
To be forgotten.
It's a shortage.
It's always the same.
There's always another.
But simple.
Alone.
Always far.
And inside.
That's it.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) Between a good school.
Dec√≥ria.
I got good grades.
