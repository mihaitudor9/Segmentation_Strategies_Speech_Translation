Uooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
[A.DE.]
In 2016, I was given a prize - a big university class - I think this is the first step to create environments of fewer formal data, more rivaling data - let's imagine that this is the first step to create environments of less formal, more resilient data - and to try to maintain high control of the students.
Well, during my lessons I use a method that is used by ananticity.
It's a storytelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students: artificial intelligence.
(Laughter) Like all the stories I tell in children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
Second World War: UK, 1942, Blockchain Park, a residence north of Londra.
There was a very thirty young man, at that time, the guys used a specific machine, theedes used this paper and had in front of a tact without sense, and he had a research dot in the Princeton Unit in America, which letters stamp out other letters, according to a code based on the vehicle.
Alan Turing, for this invention, you think that the war is over with two years of anticipation, saving many humans quickly, it was one of the main characters of crack, the one you can see behind, in order to decipher these writes by Puedes.
Well, Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
It is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence, with his Turing machine and formed them the computer thing even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, there's an article about the minds magazine: where Twing's test proposes, the question behind the testing is a necessary.
Well, machines can think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
(Laughter) Let's may be a person here, who is driving on a computer, a machine M is an operator "O," who asks, who asks questions, and on the other hand, the terminal is an O's operator.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the Mouse machine is overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker: this is a game limiting.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the answers, to argument in an automatic way to formulate these answers, and to learn in an automatic way.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence, one of these is cognitive approach, based on human thinking.
According to this process there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts at the moment they get, or we try to modify our thoughts at a psychological level.
That's it.
That's why it says that artificial intelligence is highly connected to neuronal, cognitive, and psychology, according to this approach, the assignment that if we can have a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking, and probably many of you have heard of Aristotele's sillogism.
All men are mortal, they try to build deductive arguments, according to the question of thinking, from here the deductive logic is born, under two premises, it deduces in a vertical conclusion: Socrate and mortal, and transferred into a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies, rational people, agency, must act?
You have to adapt to this, you have to set goals, and know how to bring them to the end, and you must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is linked to intelligent objects, while incorporating Turing's quote, a machine can think, in terms of thinking, to highlight our intelligence and our identity.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
By building artificial integral entities, we try to understand intelligence as a psychological composition, once we have a lot of knowledge about this issue, we try to build intelligent artificial integrities and supported by humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see today if machines can think, I'd like to explain to you about the state of artificial intelligence according to their abilities.
There are underworld actors, parameters, human beings, for example, agents that deal better with all men and can't do better, for example agents that resolve Rubik's cube with four of them in the best way, and with a sad one, think that a year ago a young man has been given the first part of the Rubik cube in 4.73 seconds.
For example, in the game of the scacks, in the Pker Texano's game, we have human rights agents, a few years ago, the Russian camp of scacks, was devastated by artificial people, we have Sovian agents, which are better than all people.
In the end, we have subtle people who suffer from all kinds of people, examples are the classification of objects, the recognition ofigraphy, vocal recognition, the translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today can't do, for example, an overwhelming: these today are the largest, the majority of artificial intelligence, in which we think we're far from overcoming the concept like mela, or we're talking about the Apple Corporation mark.
Making machines think.
And a few years ago, in America, this concept was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence in the world, imagine the line of time.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to use this computer composition, such as measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radioppy years and in four years, imagine a facial line that indicates human intelligence to split, this equipment fits for thousand dollar to this computer capacity.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we will already be able to operate in a precise way our brain, and finally, in 2029 the machines will pass the test and will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045, and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
(Laughter) In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow an exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
In its article, published in mind journalist, Turing not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against her own test.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, followed a history of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, performed by professor Gaitano in Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to take was proposing a decent observation against artificial intelligence, which, unfortunately, has left us a few years ago.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine, and this becomes more intelligent than us, so we got an artificial equality, and we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine, and then we let the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story?
Starting back to the first question, machines may think: I would like to share with you an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Good afternoon.
(Applause) How many of you today have spoken about photos?
