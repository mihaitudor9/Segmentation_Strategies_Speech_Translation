(Applause)
Poorry?
fragility.
And some of you will know what to do, these two words apparently far away.
Be, you must know that, until some time, I had my two memories.
Better raised.
Mars and Francesca.
And...
To fall asleep they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big.
But I don't.
So the story ...
I would like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little kid, the alcohol.
Thank you.
Interpolate?
It's terrible.
The word?
They were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years pass, the child becomes a boy.
But we suffer a lot, a lot about the sidewalks, and it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, psychologists, all brave people, a lot of professionals.
But nobody can do it.
What do I want to take this incasant?
One day, I traveled to Roma.
And so, just for pure fortune?
Take a look at a little girl.
His name was Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says.
Give a break.
When?
One day.
Would I look for a child?
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Mrs. Teresa," but what beautiful words of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting?
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
In turn, it became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But a good day ...
In the dawn of his country were celebrating a big party with a padsmare.
And a microphone, in the middle.
Now, can you imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor?
But imagine what a microphone means?
It was a bucket.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the battles he had written, the comic fights, was too big and he didn't think about it.
He came out gradually, took the microphone and said, "Salva everyone!
I'm a computer engineer, you think I'm so brave in the internet than my first words, just as I was born: web, web!
That's how it happened.
People were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
What is this a man?
Appreciate at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
Hello.
But they were laughing with him.
So one of my family would have interrocted me and would have said, "Yes, man, we've understood that you are."
And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say about strength.
Then, I thought, "Yes, guys, that's a bit the problem of having Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power runs us.
But first, I have to tell you something very important: why when I spoke about my disability, my debility?
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they got out of there.
The best of themselves.
What is a moment?
I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part.
This also works the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me, find me...
A disability, and can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes.
We went to Padova's City Hospital: we were called me and my wife who is in the fifth grade.
A prosthesis makes us stick in a very small stone, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only one seed.
And she makes my wife walk again.
Let's take the paper and read it.
Trisomy.
21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They are the words of that little glass.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the father's glass is my wife.
She says, "Yes, puzzled, dotted, but our son is a mask and a female."
The dotter says, "Scuse signs, maybe she didn't understand."
The 21st trisomy.
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answers.
And no, as a doctor, I understood great, but I only wanted to know if our child is true.
It's a mask...
Or is it a female?
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "A misery carrier, we don't even know what we were able to do the NELA mask, but it's summ!"
The dotors have given the head to the dot.
Thank you. (Applause)
Good afternoon.
We approach this subject a lot, but I assure you it was, of course, a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in the world.
I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyone.
After a few months,
Anna has arrived, it's the present, it's a marvelous one, it's very beautiful, it's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families.
The truly wonderful thing is that it has come to all the best people, it has become the best to me, the best my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find us.
What if this isn't the power?
But we noticed one thing.
That all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by speed and analysis.
We know everything, but few.
Many of these people had encountered people.
Community.
And then, to put together some of these things together, and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone news" and "Second Anna".
Like this, without predicting too much serious, but not at all, older people.
We look at the good news that bring us: For example, a little while ago, Francesca came home.
And saying, you know they use them as a fence at school, and then we did this card, where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use it, but you know, one, how you're fired..." "Back this one, and you're going to be app?"
So this part is here.
Or.
Another place where it says, "But is it true that you suffer from Down syndrome and don't give birth to blue eyes?"
(Laughter) Bella is said "Communicomy".
Because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in more, I don't know.
I'll give you an example: do you present TED?
Did you get a small X?
(Applause) No, why can I give you this example?
Why you, today, (Applause)
To confess TED, talk to people, you've done a little bit of fate, and here's the invitation: make a little bit of fat, and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life.
Whether it's personal, it's also people around you.
A very shortcut, but ...
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on the Internet.
Or a blow underwater.
Well, to wake up the eyes you have to put them at the same level.
In this sense, it captures me a lot of losses, that's why I like a Polish modern.
Living from scars to my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon.
With this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't have to keep you wanting.
Being a disability trace.
In your life?
Do I want to fix them?
And most of all?
And do you remember?
The pause.
Why can you look at the face?
They become brave.
Thank you very much for the heart. (Applause)
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like Maoce, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And I understood what my mission in the world was, in fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds, nor a romantic disorder, as they told us about some speakers earlier, but for an ortag, it went well, it could go onstage, while swimming, ortags.
To make you realize how scary it scares every day, of how much scarc percentual it has happened to me, it's what has happened to me one night because of a traffic, and this thing has opened my mind, has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment I decided that what I had done, what would be my mission in the world.
It seems there would be nothing left to be drawn.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's the reason we can decide, for us, for our family, every single day.
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but also an issue of environmental impact.
Why our food choices, each day?
They are currently part of our daily environmental impact.
Let's try it with an index where we could talk, for example, about ecological pressure.
And it increases much more what we choose to ordinary the opponent, that maybe the way we dress or how we move to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be if not else is perfectly aware of the choices they make every day.
Trying to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
And it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied.
At every day's life, especially at what's our informe with food, using means, for example, the way we use our defense.
It's how we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
And then, obviously.
Trying to use 100% of the subjects.
Well ...
The thing of consumers also, to optimize consumers, is especially the way in which we compose the behavior every day.
So, what are we, indeed, carrying on a table?
I went off to this project, so, through the encounter with the trafficking of the lines, of the rejects, of what is usually the end of the wife.
We're on the streets.
Here in front of you have a small example of ...
I look to precarious raw materials.
We are used to doing what I'm doing now, every day at home, when we pull the vegetables.
And to separate from one part, there is the noble part that we use and on the one hand, there is the scary.
I'm scared, so, the less noble part.
In average, it's at least 50% winter, and it's up to 70 percent, because a lot of vegetables.
They have more protected parts, so what to optimize in the kitchen means changing food, is to use 100% of the raw materials?
But it's not just about regaining these things.
That's about being a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joint together.
Let's take an example with mine.
I can see her with me.
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
With this implicity, I made chips, but I could also like that naturally, make a cake.
The business?
Magarius I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria, it probably costs me more, the treasure, the focus, and I'm going to ferment it to every single ingredient.
Another example, one of the ants that led us more time to love.
I want to love 100%, for example, juice really loves me.
The busy is the veracity of the nobility, it's where the conviction of fiber concentrates.
It's less than the dust, which perhaps if you don't like the dust too much, you can concentrate on the seeds.
And it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit surely for health.
But not only: with all internal behaviors I can prepare a cell, the seeds.
Should I celebrate or simply make them manage?
And to manage something I think is a practical example.
It's a very easy technique, but it allows us to transform and value ourselves as well.
Something that we all have at home is that we usually don't doubt a look and go for it.
So optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that.
A bit of your mentality and seeing with a different eye.
In particular, ants, but all food to sprease less and appreciate it to mass.
Useing also means optimizing consumers of energy heater, for example.
And many times here, there is too much or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, water there are other things.
To make verdors is enough to have a cable, it's not that suitable to know what, or every time I use an appliance like storage lava.
To use it as well to care, and it's not just a cause.
I'm sure that some of you are rooting the bare, but it's a very high spoon technique, low temperature.
So it doesn't happen that you use a professional tool for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use the vast covers all the time you wash the pieces.
How do you do it?
A very practical example: take a glass like this, it must be a hermetic therapist.
For example, we have a new copper with the water and youth.
And you give it to the middle of the torch plates, the window must not be full, full of golden plates like always.
If you had the sheet you prefer, you chose the base, of course, to the mirror of the jokes and not the opposite.
And when the washing ends, your egg will be to the coke, to the side, to the sidewalk you've chosen, and will be fantastic because it will be lit to a low temperature, so much better than the classic sidewalk, an incredible coherence.
And have you done it at zero level, at this zero?
And in addition to obtain a result that would hardly obtain with traditional technology.
So ...
I can also optimize the use of domestic intelligence, I think I can give beneficial interests.
Another application of optimizing this time to theattoo, I even enter your home even more.
Then, when we were in war, OK?
There was a lot of food in it.
We had a few proteins, they would eat a lot of potatoes, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the cake, for example, the candles.
I protected was a party.
And it worked like this: now the problem is opposite, we have plenty of droplets.
And we have a bit of tenderness.
Let's put aside the doppy of proteins that help us, because it's a problem, because, in reality, if we eat swords or thickets, yes, we may put our weight over.
But if we put the protein ratio, we are actually waiting for rivers, featured, and also increasing the risk of developing some patologies, and so it's something that ...
We don't do it, so the classic portion of the speaker, but we also do it in our heads.
It can be for legs, cards, fish.
In fact, it's too much overwhelming, eating so many vegetables, and we really take a great part of our world's fabbis.
of daily proteins: Why did I add this to my talk?
What's it?
Changing more than what we are using is our sponsors, our resources.
It's certainly something that we can improve?
If most of these proteins are animal proteins that have surely...
An enormous environmental impact.
Well ...
In other words, also riding it, can decrease its environmental impact.
I think it's important that all of us would be a few less protected in theattoo.
It would suffice a small effort to be part of all of you to have a great social benefit.
Surely environmental.
Alone, but also on our health.
The rights of all our country, even more if we did it globally, even in public spirits for health.
It's also a benefit of being the singer and of course for society.
I think it's more efficient to try to convince you, to put a few fewer proteins in theattoos that perhaps try to convince all of you to drop off the products at home, maybe you'll convince one.
Maybe that's what I want you to be ready, you don't need to worry about eating enough, but not eating too much, that's the problem of proteins.
Trying to eat them as quality.
And more possible, regarding animal products that have a low environmental impact.
You may be wondering, "Well, in other words, next year we will also be excited, and there are a lot of people who talk about food of the future, the future, I mean so much insects.
Personally, I think I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me.
We are not just a comic country of insects and I think we'll hardly become it.
There is also a protein food, which is absolutely here: zero waste.
What can we do to make ourselves more self-productive at home?
And that, furthermore, we can nourish more vegetables, maybe not the ones that will be wearing toothpaste, but the things that aren't able to use, what am I talking about?
This is talking about the bones.
A surprise that I'm on stage today.
That means to stay.
Who has suffered the first arrhythm of the Trentin Sea, as you can see, is a decipher at night to go to the letargo. In any case, I have here a representation because I like the lights.
And I mean, why can any of us self-protect them?
I'm a winning product.
What is a part of the Italian tradition?
In the room, who among you has never eaten lunch?
Okay, who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, he had more foodmen than the accent.
Five 35 years ago, a law stops us from regaining them.
We were also rooting lumps, but the only one to be approved by professional producers: this promoted a great development of light producers in Italy, and we are countries.
And there is precisely what the economy has at the global level: there are thousands of producers in Italy, not only for food use, but also because they are used, then for the cosmos and for other users.
But it's a food that also ask chef friends ...
It's extremely versatile, really so many to dare.
It's an extremely delicate taste, you just need to know what to do: to alleviate your lights that at home is enough a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of earth, a retina, in order to avoid it escaping.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to drop off the draft, or you can drive uova, and then feed it with vegetables, so to zero food waste.
And two times a year, you will have your recipe in your own spring, like an orchestra.
They stay at a time of cotting around an hour and then you can do whatever you want.
The Burghignon, the French buses, or richer a stranger.
And can surely dare satisfaction?
And there's a meat among the other fathers, which has a lot of benefits, and, in my opinion, it can be not only food in the future.
But also food in the present.
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they will never eat them.
I'm sure they created a small change of mentality and surpassing of a prejudice, so sustainable revolution: I'm convinced that you can be at the cover of any of you and that really riches a small change.
A change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices: they're conscious that to ask you to carry out the vast coast, to eat all the tips, start to start the mourning machines isn't just one thing ...
It's so simple, but I'm a very optimistic person.
But in reality, I'm sure you don't have any other mistake.
It's less protein in theattoo to change the way we see all the ingredients.
And the benefits are really many.
So unit of me became revolutionary, because benefits really are so many, are for our health.
For well-being ...
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you. (Applause)
breast, breast, well.
I've brought two data with me.
One, huh!
But it's a common fact with "Hey, face," from one to the "Sai."
The other?
I went to ten facets: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing?
Now let's play: you'll launch your side for ten gangs.
I'd like you to know: bring this game, put an equal or largest number in me.
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
Seeing with the fact: the ten face is easier.
But you must say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory.
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
With a bit of peace starts and a lot of lights, I understood that the provedity of victory is approached to 75%.
And with the increase of releases, my stock based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
And this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
And then, if you had a little nervous to release data a thousand times, we could do a computer.
The door you'll have to reach 100 million data incidents?
In just one second.
Well, this kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
Is it a powerful method, can we stimulate a data release?
But also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of battery of an epidemic, or even the abandonment of financial systems.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
But a pure mathematician rhythm of the method Monte Carlo, un elegant.
How would we be abused of the brutal strength of computer science?
I find it quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Whispering) Now let me give you the data.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
But unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which was so much streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
(Laughter) The environment of work at exceptional rule, or my workplace, a supercomputer.
And to summarize the conferences are at the end of the day.
And the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competition and unbearable humanity.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technical, often frustrating, and also based on innovative research.
As every ITA see, there are ten, 100 failures attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time on my own, on the front of the computer or on a statistical background.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion that I wasn't seen before.
So, here in motion, there's a topic that serves a bunch of algae for a mathematician who studies the west.
But I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
In a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how much, you think they're taught in Maths and in English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson?
Then, if there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't care to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I questioned a genius.
I started to live in lessons and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to be prepared alone. I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, surprise them, and make them happy.
I tried to take advantage of every opportunity.
I got a diploma in didors with university, and I began to teach two hours to the students of the first year to more than eight years old in births of the most advanced things.
(Laughter) The fathers were the job positions, more than so much efficient, strong and determined.
And then, it wasn't about work for me.
But I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Preparing with the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I like it, perfectly, to be brave enough to compete.
The authority of the students, rightly wrong if they are, brings a continuous learning.
(Laughter)
There's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman.
(Laughter) What about the wow?
My favorite, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) The gratitude of the students straightened up my entire fatigue.
And I was learning from them as much as they were learning from me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
But at the cost of my doctorate, I had so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
It was all so natural, beautiful, brilliant.
[A.DE.]
In my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into place.
At that point ...
I have to check everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to that question on the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is that the reason for all this euphoria, fuel, those limitings of determination?
The answer I gave was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, of the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
There's a concert.
Behind TED, this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, also a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
But among these goods?
There is also knowledge.
I had found value, passion for knowledge, sharing knowledge.
And my mind will be ready in motion, in the moment I had tried to put in motion the lies of my students.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Laughter) As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great.
But the university is not the only place where mathematics and communication meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But are we not going to see?
We've also told this capital of my story, because I think that what I've learned is shared.
The methodology of Mostring it as part of, for example, is to undertake a path that doesn't reveal what we saw, or to find purpose and motivation through strings.
Because we weren't expecting it, and passion was also passionate about the catalizer of our talents and the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
I invite you to read.
It's the preparation of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
I come in a good eye, I tell you the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
Have you care of the other?
I land the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise I've prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some attention to design questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night watching theami of the five years passed, I collected everything they can expect in a model.
He could have a good lesson at the end.
Another guy, a few seconds ago, asks me where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had been practicing it for a long time, but there are plenty of materials online, and we have to find it written on the rear of the diagram.
But I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
(Laughter) I used to go to the workshop, but I often came to them to ask how to procedure, to each point in practice, we play a theory element, which we repeat the stages together.
Anyone was a very difficult question, but I had spent the afternoon on their testo book, they were well prepared, I had it.
"I work with them to make them take the spiral."
It's then saying, "Waw, I'll encourage you to the magnifying glass for the exam."
A group of students breath.
Anyone asks for evidence, but most of them only reassuring.
Is it an ultimate student?
So, what's the point?
Isolvido.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
(Laughter) Anyway!
It's me brave enough, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
(Sigh) I ended up in class, and I have a huge smile and a more giant one.
And I think that maybe...
This is exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
Well, this is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are worthy.
And for this reason...
When the mind is in movement, even the heart beats strong inside the pitch, (Applause) I'm lying in motion, thank you.
(Music) You are born in Australia, Melbourne, more than 59 million dollarium, and they start to grow up the bathrooms, and sustained by the feminist of Bafco, where MOVE is already a global movement, affected in more than 21 countries.
Slowly, in Mosco. We took the research, put our bathrooms, got a selfie and shared it #CretoTUTUTUTUTUTUT: Rive the research, live in Bander, surrounded by Computer.
(Applause)
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
It was in the US and I was doing a Master's campaign.
And that's how a bit of freshness came into a bar, I carry my book.
And as often the captain, when I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me out of others, started to listen to different conversations.
What was talking about change, she said to her, "We must change your attitude, you should do this, in other words, change."
It was a central topic: Samatina my colleagues this year presented it in a very clear way.
Now.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
your diversity.
If you prefer your diversity, do you feel far from the opposite?
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with diverse intelligences.
One of which has more intelligences and you're there to mix and say, "Well, now what am I doing then?"
It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know how to go out, right?
And the opportunity appears here, right now, from diversity, that is to integrate ...
Everything that has brought a different background, remembering my daughter one day.
Alright.
She was a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so at some point, the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi only two men say, "Of course, we are really three men?"
And she says, "No, no, her two, you know with mom."
I guarantee you - okay, I was already close to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small - I say, "Well, Carlo, why do you love them?"
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the straight below.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
And this is the difficulty, but, if you don't know...
I want to create a culture of change, on the other, we need to create leaders, change.
Why did I work for many years?
In companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
It's not the immediate thing.
The brilliant leaders do this too, so whenever I drink this cake, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States to write in a paper.
The word change accounts this word of change, I start a thinking that gives me, I don't know how many hours and it begins to put into other words.
transformation, creativity.
That's when, like this, to play ...
It starts to put together these words and form an act: cacci.
"Clapping."
that in reality is a prison, it's a bit of achievement that, for me, of course, is a prosthesis of personal entirety.
Today, a leader must have, that is to know how to stay, to know how to drive, but to be present and lead change.
The cake is an act, and you know for creativity.
Eventions of transformation in change, in other words, creative people of transformation and change.
What's the new setting here?
For me, at least, the increase.
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the prospective change that ...
But what I thought, that of taking this leap, of doing things, to deliver roles.
To work on projects.
Putting people from one place to another, and in this being there is a transformation that involves you, bringing me apart, isn't it?
I'm doing a project, I'm paid on the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and all that I carry with you?
To what, to the development of creative thinking, which brings it a little?
What makes this transformation move?
Why can we do this if it's true that the work of me ...
On the other hand, I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A bit of the ability to dream: to this model, we've imagined it later.
Out of five...
The fundamental purposes: the first one would know about transformation, transformation means...
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may be in Spain occupying marketing, rather than communication.
But creativity is something that affects everyone.
To love the story you were in.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can celebrate your simple creativity, zamattina, we started with a tunnel, brainstorming, and that is one of the tips that allows you to...
Just go for your account.
And this is creativity.
What does this creative thinking about working on divergent and convergente thinking?
But this is not enough.
We need to take a leap and ...
Doing a slightly deliberate movement, right?
Let's start to involve that which is the emotional part, the frame of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
This is, to precisely encourage the absence of sex to your emotions.
Those forts, those that make us feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
So, fear, when you feel you're not brave, and you have to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's also those.
When you know about your emotions, can you allow yourself to depend on the judgment?
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing this ...
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a change of rule, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotion gives you to do this.
To give the numerous examples of leader who have made these trips, just to suffer in Italian fields probably deserve marimets.
In Rome, but at the same time, even those with Milano know that it's awarded at the other day, just like the world's magical field, for innovation and is increased by 67%.
That's what it means.
Transformations.
They observe them, as they say inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which your workers, and so the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of people.
Opportunity: Let's say that I manage to create cylinder, but in reality?
I'm not so much for the idea of managing.
But how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is to support the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create things.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day.
If you construct the environment in which people can fight on ideas.
It may have a free spirit, as to say, to relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and this is not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results as if the results were achieved only in one way.
But wow, dare ...
Did I manage the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions?
I also gave it the opportunity to do more than that?
To explore new definitions.
And to do this, it's not so mediated: then you don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, asks a child to imagine something and then do it.
I asked an adult ...
Being there, there's a competition in it, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, it's better I can't say it, it's better that I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins, doesn't it?
Then, what is interesting when we get to this situation is exactly: how do I do it?
Do I get involved in collecting creative spirit?
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact that necessarily ...
It is a routine, if it doesn't work in organisation, it's also about reinving the client's relationship.
Why?
The prosthesis is completely changed.
Then, to return to that original beer.
So, the idea is exactly ...
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation?
To integrate the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a way of liberating to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, or looking at the people who are here, I can restore my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, looking at people can find something that isn't that strangered.
So the sense of attention we saw in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking.
But this feels clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all.
The thing of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
Then it goes out.
So, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Audience): Yes!
(Applause)
We are about to land.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
What's the chance?
To see from above?
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
Man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They stop living not all separated, but together.
It's like...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
As you can see, maybe there's no money, and in fact, in this city...
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and they became quite famous.
because Marx is his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what today captivates you when you did your weekend to New York or to Parigi.
Imagine.
They were stripped, without daughters.
Besides, it's a bucket.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that caractic packs prevented one with the other.
And of course.
I had two scratches with the book.
It was called.
The sentence.
In the operating class in the cities?
where the city was accused.
Of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be ...
Causa.
About the pollution, the insicurity, the poverty.
And there's no other way.
limiting this phenomenon possible was how to say.
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from this ...
Behind, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
Nacquevo!
Also, the discipline of tools to limit this phenomenon, I realized that it was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendous feeling that, maybe, some of you have heard about, that has bizzy tools, one is called mindfulness.
It's the roof that, when you changed a wall at home, you have to make hundreds of practices.
After that,
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the place where you can imagine...
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or the zonization that fortunately you have never met?
What do you get to say?
Is it worth imagining?
In a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then!
Let's also imagine films and culture.
It's a huge spectrum about the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It has a prison where all the world's challenges are launched by the upset and scanned forever.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all the processes, this leads to adventure a little moon from 1845.
It has a 20-year-old window.
The sentence comes.
If I'm a scientist in science, this sentence, it's a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
We know that the city is not the cause of all the world.
Under the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution!
All the big questions related to the human being.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
Sure, economical development, work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Congratulations.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The foundations that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world, the first one.
It's the density, can you see what myallels are?
My photo was taken from the upshots of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more activities, how many more.
Imagineations that can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me another sidewalk which also ignore me the most famous calling.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Here's my idea.
What is the city, in the end, assaulted and added in some way as a solution?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The bigness.
The inhabitants are all used to confront this other city for the inhabitants, for the massive, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solve.
The greatest questions of humanity?
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has managed to thrive at such an individual interest in being sidewalk, and so the definition of the city is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
So?
A city can also lose its status.
Now we all know, some cities also in Italy, too big.
"Why?"
Maybe in this moment ...
After thousands of years of history, these abilities have dramatically suspected.
Walter!
Magari?
Please, may you consider that right now, or in some periods?
Remember.
Now!
This virtuous mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
Boys and tools of containment of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the past few years.
And that they are not afraid.
And it's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
To feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast.
With utopia and courage.
The first example?
It's from Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
What about the satellite?
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the city center, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
Who among us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving around the city?
The idea is...
Nominale.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbitical stage that every day can walk, as I did.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps, can you imagine?
It's a element of diversity and strength.
Creding!
In the positive things of the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
The first sentence of solution, cities like nurses.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you have all these spots.
The second example is now that.
Done.
a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do with this city in 2030 with all of them happy?
Buenos Aires, more than in others.
Paese is the perfect one.
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed, was in some way untouched.
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
Comets the solite!
The one that...
It limits development.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
It's possible to believe.
In the power of this mental weapon.
What are the cities?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
There are strategies?
What do development accelerate?
And what do you see as an asset?
A shell of intensity, that is, a huge population.
An enormous infrastructureator, "What?"
The creation of spacies, pedestals or glasses.
Do you see this?
It's density.
The richer piano in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but to increase a million.
The inhabitants more in the city.
Build?
Situiting.
Children lower, with lower rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency but of the whole world and the creativity to get together.
Then we build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I'm a doctor.
That allows us to...
We believe more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I've mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
The spaces were there,
Diver and pedonals.
And these tragedies together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
That's it!
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Keep it?
And Magai?
Sitting the spot on the spotlight, you will keep it above.
This great invention of humanity?
What is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
So many times.
And maybe...
Angry, very proud.
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause)
The words are important.
They put us on ideation.
It has never been our thoughts.
The words of our language.
There's nothing.
They're evocating that they're full of stories, of vibrations, of emotion.
I'm a son.
This is not.
Evocative, they laugh with our history.
"Yeah!"
To beauty was our language.
And it's the fact that this beauty is seen.
Tutterata, preserved, perceptible.
Again.
I said, "Perfect!"
Teachers of A.
Madea Montcante.
The English idea: provincial and emotional mixing, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But the penetration was a bit like the larvae.
And will I start to show you?
Some negative twists.
They have many signs on their designs and social networks of universities in the world.
And they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a cone, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana.
It's incodeous.
Emedonics.
In Svetia.
In the leg united to the Kins College de Ronda, on the coat united Oxford.
In Chicago, in the United States.
"Alrad" says "written" in his insurance.
Not just that.
universities.
Happyly.
Dichiarian, if you're in Latin.
Well!
Londra has a Latin motto.
That's it!
Homoto Latin, Canada.
No, there's a mini jazz device.
The 15lan, in Australia, has a Latin motto.
But not only: well!
The American Marina says, "Stop finishing it, if you've heard it, it's always true."
In a thousand film.
The British marine speaks in Latin, and even an institution there is no money to be a passport.
Like NASA.
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
Why am I doing it so late with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a single place in the world.
Where could a Latin motto be?
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
"Yeah!"
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What's the decent?
Beautiful.
Roman city has proven and threw away from the American municipality.
That's it.
(Laughter)
It doesn't even understand how we should say it, (Inglese) "I've done it."
"Wow, manu?"
What is this support of bass reading?
What is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two leaves that give sense to each of us, what are the five pallets high?
(Laughter) (Applause)
And one is asked.
But why?
But in the moment we are all the tourist patients in all the cities of the world, there is no one who leaves the point to settle their names.
I was promising.
It's no part of it.
It's like a dogma.
"Daddy, dad, you've got in your tracture."
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
Very good, everyone!
It's Dalla.
Oh, Ministry of Benicuto, you'll see it beautiful!
Done?
(Laughter)
No, not really beautiful to see, Beautiful.
We are the English Italians in a way of entirely.
S: Yes, it's a ghost.
I don't like us, I don't like the microphones, the thing.
It's curious, it's this one.
Againstile.
Pic.
Italy, isn't it?
But we're still Italian, no, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
I've used gold: the world's most dominant language, according to ten linguists, in Gossasso.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses, study, or because they love it.
For the pool, for the opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
Build for that.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, all the hands.
It doesn't die.
That's it.
I want to see, for example.
He achieved the world, continued to call.
Pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map with the same map of the negotiations that sell to bug or...
Hotdoxon brings the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And she says "Pizza."
Why do we here in Italy drink wine?
Keep here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
If there's a story there must promote the week of Italian wine, of Colombian.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
That's it.
Wow!
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's take the reason, let's talk about fashion.
What about this?
It's what scratches the paper.
Rivist, Italian, fashion.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the Winter Flow.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
"Mommy, explain and ask you who told me."
(Laughter)
Excuse me: "Tell me like a ..."
The mountain was in "Gankension."
And no folks.
Like they are at our Devenery.
And the women we see in ours?
Remember mental birth.
Why?
Close.
But there are no curves.
Let's talk about publicity, old, advertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a "no" bubble in Spain and in Spain.
A publicity payment in the medesimbieture in France and in the palace.
A lot.
This is the same payment in Italy and it speaks English.
There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) (Applause)
What is happening to us if the unionacaco perfectly disappeared?
(Laughter)
It says, "Let's use our radicies that we call "chi."
The Argentinians say, "I'm on the Internet."
I saw uniance.
She says it sounds catital, isn't it?
I couldn't do it.
That's it.
The curious thing, why?
Oh, it's where it's Italy, you don't have it, no!
I don't like the word "inglee."
And 60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) And who?
It's waiting for medical abilities in the sign of what happens.
It's compiled by the sign that I've compiled this model of the association, and it's an advantage of linguistic competition.
Or, every day, for drugs and prediction, for conformism, because it seems model to us, because we are self-vincident.
We use a quantity of English words.
There's no one.
Not deeply, it's said in the text of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We said "yes," instead, calling, we say "location," instead of that, I've heard it.
The phenomenon is the "location" that was chosen by the incot, the thirst of a patent is a location.
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must give a shower of breeding bags with satisfied marriages.
With business, it's united.
When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because then the unite business is always kind, fair and general.
(Applause)
It says "glese" and "mails" only talk about it in companies, but also in media, public administration.
The Govern.
We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset didn't have much fun.
And I have forced the newspapers of Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We made a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
And I added:
I had to do something: communicate my friendship.
Or in mind two thirds: "Cesis and tools that can be effective."
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To raise awareness and pay attention to this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
I'm a bit of energy.
This petition?
who invented it.
Mindring companies, the code!
The surprise, in media, a dirt.
In Italian?
And sometimes, in the first phase, the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for us.
A speech of disappearance.
But not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting names, cognitions, addressing, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, polygloppies and people who didn't spouse that the engineer has signed directors and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers, the English teachers, signed up with professionals and called pensioners, signed up.
Italians, allestern.
"What about our language and they signed a story in Italy?"
To a movie is the whole world.
From Singapore, from Jerus Jalem, it gives me "Peduda," "chuddha," from the north Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
Open.
To observe these signs that grew up and to read their motivations.
"I want to make you come from someone."
Italian is a right.
But also a doarm.
We are in the FUFA novel.
If we think consciously, we'll talk other tango secretly: I work in a public administration, help.
Figno, because I studied classic studies, "Oh, I have to do a job with economists."
I was in fashion, I received a laughing app, it's not for the individual and the trend, I don't believe it's going on.
(Laughter)
An Italian and an English twenty I heard better than a speaker and English, Swiss.
And we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
This is the episode.
I have a new strange: but it's Italian, it says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
So it starts to let me talk about our language decence.
Because you can't say, "Hey, my day was a fellow friend of what I did." (Laughter)
(Applause)
To Dante, to Montal, to Caproni, to Paese, Bernata.
I'm stupid to feel those who, no, know how to say, are tables.
But do you remember Company's mouth, do you do it?
And that's what happens.
We celebrate because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
The movies, because I've heard about it, the universe is that they say displegated, instead, that they visualized.
(Laughter) I'm filming because I don't know how to explain (Laughter) (Applause)
I live because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, it's 85 years old.
Thanks for the motors.
That's it.
I just said.
A echo.
It's about transversal order, because mass media has traveled this thing from cost zero to red.
And the un amplified one.
And this initiative is used.
In addition, 130 little ones on Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and inimaginable.
They didn't talk together, girls and thirds, on their stores, only in publications.
But the gathering with great applause as well, in Italy security, and coming from it.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vaniti Ferr talked about this.
He has Padlato, the Christian family.
He spoke to me about Turing's threat, he has spoken today that the behind him made a publishment: azensity?
That's it!
And that it's stone all the usual tree, also a little bit of coffee and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and put them to the most populated ones.
And you've often had a great desire to laugh at each other with discomfort and consciousness of our language.
This thing was finished in the newspapers, and it also supported me to put me in the city, on the ship to talk about Tigi.
It was taken from the place, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a B.
And from theand.
That's it.
That's necessary.
That's it.
And all of this?
Something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the spiral and bring it to the world because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
The mail passes.
Then.
"That's how it works!"
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonaldo himself defined "Homo Sanza Litter."
I was saying "involgata" in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
We resign, express one of the pecuriarities.
Deleflettesity.
That's it.
Wonderful!
The potential of our lives.
It perfectly Italian creativity.
It's the bike in your silk language.
And even in our linguistic view is, "Fote, alone, can we pick up some strange minds of charity?
But we need to fix it inside a thesis that is not fulfilling.
The logo.
From a silver medal to an excess.
The endless men are unhealthy.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
(Applause)
(Music) What does it mean to be a young player?
When a guy stares at me,
Attention is all about that person, about its needs.
But if that person is also going to something that isn't your mom, what about your mom?
What happens?
What happens to you if mom or dad or her parents?
I started to see if I was still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the worst idea of being a young woman.
As everyone went to school, I liked and sat down with my friends, but what's behind these photos?
What can't you see?
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called "S health Problem," and when one hits through many parents and everybody else, a child, a teenager, they are reference points, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
Fairy for a child can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harm, fear, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they alternate naturally.
The constant feeling of walking on the shoulders, an excessive burden of responsibility.
And the difficulty to focus?
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But how do we add that?
You can have to manage flaws and emergencies, for which no one has prepared you.
How to manage, but when your father or your mother saw many things that psychologists don't exist.
"Oh!"
We had to do with alternating in depression rooms, without anybody preparing to do it, or even support, pay attention to suicide attacks.
But how do we add all this?
So I had to keep going, I had to make my life always, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another goal.
It's often not able to talk to anyone.
That's Dichy.
That your mother or Tobabana, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will hear it for this or will remind you of parents' problems or deities.
It's hard for somebody to consider you as a genetically committed and destined to be automatic to ered the same disorder.
But what if you tried to say that your mom or your grandma?
They have a metaphoric disorder, a bipolar disorder, a schizophrenia, or if there is not even a diagnosis to describe their behavior.
We, parents, something that will not answer the eternal world will be completely different.
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good.
It belongs to all of us, and this brings a way to understand what happens inside you and your own love.
The urge to ask and receive help many times not to receive a cure.
And for you who are a child, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceived around you the difficulty of communicating inside the family.
Tigmatism, prejudice, neglect, can lead you to having everything inside and not just say nothing: but loneliness, in silence, I'm a heavy person to bring to a wormer, how do I face to face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside fear, rage and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time...
There was also a result of help, a result of help that couldn't allow us to pull, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade started to open in that hill when, for the first time, light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consultant who is the first person out of the family.
The one I've been able to open and help me, we have to see people sitting around me the certainty that they could be supported.
But the truth and the "Stop A" was for me?
On the Internet, on the forum, on the stories.
Children from other countries, thanks to love for the crazy people who had brought me the trips.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has held me and that we have in common.
Now we're convinced we're the only ones.
But it's statistically impossible: in the world we are millions of people.
Or we invited us to be there, to be no one else, to have lived the same things that we lived with us.
And you know why it happens, because our children's stories we don't talk about.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada.
Not only could I give a name to emotions that I had experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I had experienced.
But we can also see the positive characteristics that were born, precisely to face the situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent side by myself, and I went to see in Canada for the first conference I spoke about.
To meet them, these children, to talk to them.
And it was a moment of positive or powerful spectrum, because their view, the story I had experienced, but also the feeling of writing.
They have seen the dolor, but also the ability to absorb and transform the pain together for a change, I have seen those positive characteristics of resilience, empathy, courage, willing to change the same scope that I didn't recognize in me.
But that seeing the reflection in them I finally felt my own.
The counter has been an owner, an enormous owner, and it still gives me energy.
And it's an owner that I strongly wanted to take in Italy, in Europe, to help other conveiled forgots, other children forgotten.
to remove fish from their homes.
The wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel alone when one in the business starts to suffer from a psychic disorder.
It's an immune desire that needs everyone's help, because other measures.
As not to risk again to draw the weight of the world all around my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today: in 2017, together with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we were born the first Italian association, created by children for other children.
To give voice to adolescent children who don't have a voice.
To enhance our circumstances, even the institutions, and it's called "Mommy," "Paça Noffmentalities," "Happy parents with dissubumental."
We gave the trip to a project called, the mini guide I've written, and that I'd never had her hands when I was 15 years old, called UK.
When mom or dad see something that doesn't happen, she survived my parents' children with a mental disorder.
And it's a project that has started very low, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room now.
They've believed in this same desire, they've given us the influence to start and make it drink.
This project has an annual way of giving a family of this mini guide to all the libraries.
Politics, citizens, all the consultors and sedentary scientists in Italy, because no child is left alone, but also their families.
And above all, children of parents who are not aware of their disorder and don't even be cured for their disorder, and even these children must think: I was one of them for a period of time.
At first, when I thought about this project, I was detailed: I'd never make it realised how I'd do the piano, the piano, but I asked the people around me, even to the scursionist guides, proposing to tell it during a floating floor in ten minutes, the history.
To meet people in the civil society that perhaps hadn't experienced this experience.
They wanted to become our own positions in the change, and bring a box of mini guide in two or part of us.
To the library of their communities.
And now we are able to reach so many regions: from the opening, to the Sicily, the Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach them all; another wish we have is to stop the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society.
And invest more in mental health.
The other huge desire we're realizing is to meet schools, to talk to the students, to the kids.
Not only the Diver's Filigers, but everyone.
To have a marriage of atoms, to stand on.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the shifts of life, being disenged, before...
It's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
Mah...
It's something I know.
It's one of the positive characteristics that our parents' parents have mental disorder.
It's the will to change the scope.
And that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, even thanks to you.
The story that had collected you, moved you, told you, told you about your friends, your colleagues ...
Together, let's take the door that wasn't open for us.
Let's get the light, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Arone boots us.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I will surely play a hacker in common sense.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Around 14 years ago, they were in a group that wrote down, maybe you don't say much, but it was ugly in the fridge until ten years ago.
And it began, at 15 years old, the creative people, who were responsible for the technical part: today, creative Commons are around a world full of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most flexible and open copyright.
I am, for example, Wikipedia license.
About 20 years later it becomes a small start-up, it builds something that's called a reddit.
It becomes a billionaire from one day to another.
Honestly, they didn't take so much money or fame, they still do what they've always done to build an open and collaborative Internet.
Although with the Internet archaive and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving...
Terabyte and Tabytes of the Internet, directions would go to Budduto, they're archives of digital memory.
According to one of the protagonists of the struggle against Sopa, a charity law ...
What happens?
Any year, Wikipedia has even got to be a monopoly.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
What absolutely collapse is extraordinary, fantastic, anderocious, curiosity.
To love what he himself said in his blog and he was able to read until 150 year old, every text.
The economy to political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
Arone?
And this is what I tell you about her fridge, at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned to learn prestigiously.
She tells her mother that at some point, she was carrying her, and aaron was two and a half years old, was sent in Segellone and her.
The avenue on the fridge she had just attacked with him.
The calamite.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archaive Internet it presents memory, the RSSSSSSS and puts on the blogs to synchronize each other.
Creativity is a copyright, so it makes people more accessible.
And it's the content, the creative content.
The access of information comes from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that information is power.
The power information we have.
We just need to think of a second, everywhere, we go to schools, libraries, universities.
Information, it said from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
To make a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
The fact that Aron came to this ...
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all the institutions are social...
They are people's facts, so fundamentally they're culture, so they're fundamentally made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If you make the world think, according to open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
None.
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in what is called Open Hazes.
A great movement for open access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many, big editors?
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
And I said, "There were...
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla or Penazzes manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first phrase was: "information is power."
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
ASBAI had taken care of it.
Not a steward.
With this genius, I probably don't go through a look.
It means that your opportunity to do that Aaron, a CAT.
An example.
They may have a sentence to take examples to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
Yeah!
It's an aromine fact already of a veracity and its technical persecution, for having scared hundreds of thousands of artists from access to academic fish and could do it, but not in that situation.
And they are responded to actors of computer pyramid.
About 35 years old.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first arm ...
They stopped at home in New York.
She was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it.
It's the power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently.
With Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the different, different styles, people who wanted to give access to information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last time aron-sfarze intervention, a few months before dying.
Good afternoon everyone.
Every time.
Then I ask you to do this.
(Laughter) I said, "Yes!"
They're facing now and they're passing by.
[Inglese]: But how do you do it?
[Yes!]
I still had ... (Laughter) I think.
And what about it?
Attention has seen a bit of prosecutive: E39 is Streetland, Streetland, Streetland, Streetland, Spotlight, Economics, Spanish, ESA.
And with the drill.
Right?
If the women were there.
It's a return to Messen's cainer, still in Shen.
Animitic: "No, no, no.
Let's admit, this mix of COMON is an ininver and not.
It's a tinycule.
So, after the last years, this first time I love being a good age, is a free scale.
Aroundice here?
It's a banal and fundamental thing.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass sponsorship platform is used for...
To spy, to control, to oppress.
We decided another vision: fantastic, free internet, full space, free freedom of expression. Actually, these things are ...
These are two places, there are things that coexist in the same way: the Internet is too complex.
to be just one thing.
And...
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
The life experiences aren't something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here.
The hell that we live every day, that we formed setting together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first one is easy for many.
Accepting the hell and becoming a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
Second risky, there is care and learning, it continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell.
And to make it last and give you space.
(Applause)
breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, well.
Good afternoon everyone, then in 1950.
I was eating with some physical bonds in the back of the lab of Losalamos and improvedly rich people.
I was simply looking at theattoo.
And I left.
And where are all of them?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was freak, no.
I had made a reason.
Because in our galaxy there are hundreds of thousands of brains, most of them are closer to our Sun.
The oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half.
And then, if life was in parallel.
Any other planet?
It was one of those stars.
Very old, so very first.
On Earth, the Earth could be at an intelligent species wing, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, than we do, maybe we'd be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been informed of none of these intelligent civilizations.
Here's the question to close, I want to say, "Where are all how many?"
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, in effect, over the years, it's been a lot of approximities to answer this question, there were many possible answers, some really fantastic ones.
But the simplest thing is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible.
I believe that this is a question that we've asked all of us how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a stunned sky.
I was wondering if around those bright lights could be planets, about those living beings' gifts, which, perhaps, were keeping their directions and are asking the same question.
I was faced with anchangium.
Now I'm an astrophysicist, I'd like to find a scientific answer to this question: we're alone in the universe, and I really believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth.
It would be an environmental change for our species, for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
For centuries, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are physically at the center of the universe, there is no one at the center of the universe, because there is no center in the universe.
I don't know, offside Golemmedes.
Charles Darwin explained to us that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come here, we all descend from one point.
It's scended.
Comune.
Also, finding the scientific knowledge of the existence of other worldwide countries, I think it would be a third big paragonable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two.
For this reason, well, in the last years we have probably done many things going on in the directions of a possible answer, not yet we have it, an answer, but we are the first human beings.
To have scientific evidence that there are pianists around other arms.
This is one of the biggest news in astrophysics, in the last 20 years, 20 years we would have been able to suspect it.
That there were other planets, the way out, but now we have proofs.
We have thousands of planets around other galaxies, already and the penets we know, in reality, we also know that many of them are at the huge distance from their shelves to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so of sea and oceans, on their surface, and this is one of the requirements that we stop indispensable for the life we know.
Also, according to some statistics, we could see in our galaxy 11 billion pianets potentially adapted to life, subtleine or potentially because we are really moving the first steps, so we don't even have definitive evidence.
That one of these planets is indeed habitable, but we have tools that are studying them, and in the next few years...
I need light that comes from these remote worlds, we can understand many things, to understand, for example, if they have an atmosphere.
What objects are made of this atmosphere, so we can understand if there are conditions for life presence, and even in a future, not too far away, we could think in this light of tracks of tips that could actually say that, in fact, one of these planets could be.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be witnesses at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because I rewarded, I truly believe that it would be an epocal change for all of us.
One of the questions we could ask is that often, in fact, it's from the fact that we will reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare religions, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us.
From an ocean of green space, the universe is truly very big, and then I'll give you an example, a specific example: this probe, my shoulders and voglia Geruno, is the spacial framework built by humanity that has increased even more.
From the land, on a quarantine of years' trip, it came to the stars of the Solar System and entered the space to test them.
And it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed, 60,000 km from now, 17 km per second.
So it's a huge speed, but I mean, how much would it put?
This one.
This space probe to reach the bottle closer to ours, Proxima Centauri, themselves traveling in that direction.
We'd put 74,000 years old.
It's a longer time than any citizen civilty.
It's existed on our planet.
We could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels at maximum speed.
In nature.
Let's do it.
For more than four years to do this path and the other arms are incredibly farther, and I say so, just to communicate with radio ...
Other systems would last hundreds or thousands of years, through the index, the reession of an answer.
So everything is very complicated, maybe we are not alone in the universe.
But we are certainly seeming isolated.
We are in a sea of green space, and then, according to me, here's one of the things to be present when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of farms that later the interrogative in reality that we all have, in other words, where are all the many.
And...
The fact that being present is time, so we're talking about time.
One example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand sinisters and the tip of my left hand.
It's the transitional time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, 4 billion in the middle of the years.
It's great.
And then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate themselves thanks to natural selection, the evolution, the first unicellular life forms, antennas, and, consequently, of all the forms of life that have occurred on our planet, somewhere, in the palm of the sinister hand.
And just here.
The pulse from hand to hand is the explosion of shape.
In the end of the multicellular organisms, the most completed on a network of billions and billions of cells, animals, animals.
The dinosaurs appear.
At the end of the palm of your hand drowning.
And ...
In the beginning of the last failure, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely.
The impact of a large asteroid is the space between the Earth and three quarters of living species at that moment on the planet, and the distinction of these small, big, there have been many times throughout this long history.
From my life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet have been stressed.
So this gives us the idea that...
This long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long path, difficult, accident and governed by ...
They are unpredictable, and so I didn't have to carry necessarily to the origin of the most complex organisms, it didn't necessarily have to bring to the origin of intelligence.
And it would never have to bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
Together, we.
In all this, where are we?
Very well.
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And that's already happened, because today we know...
For tens of thousands of years in our planet have been around with us other human species that are no longer there, like neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be shocking, incurable, compared to life times.
It's the one of the universe.
Surely, they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they've completed a certain level of technological progress, to feed on, or simply...
They collapse with the audience, they spark, without leaving ...
Then maybe no one of these tracks of the universe.
Big cosmic silence that disrupts us and bothers us, maybe a bit like T.
A kind of warning, maybe there is...
Do I say something?
Life had to overcome...
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all.
Let's think about ourselves, our species ...
From far away, let's imagine ourselves seen from another planet.
Domani.
Probably, in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
Let's think of a very young species: just a few years ago we started to fly, to communicate on the radio, on a fifty-year-old, we sent sound.
Space is happening to the world's neighbors.
But the Solar System, really, we've just put the foot in this big ocean.
It costs.
What surrounds us?
I think we're going to be here, really, a bit like this, and we, as diferencia of the dinosaurs, we have at least part the chance of...
Changing, influencing our destiny.
We certainly have the capacity to feed ourselves, but we also have as I believe, and I hope ...
The possibility of helping scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us to guarantee.
A long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the Universe, maybe one day.
Is life on some other topic?
The planet is expensive, maybe in a far away future, so far as to reach other stars.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key of these free intelligences is to survive as long as possible, to be hard, and if we were alone in all this space?
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep it accessible, so that we can achieve this life?
It should be wonderful, marvelous, full of consciousness, park in case.
Piccoloped planet lost in the weapon of the cosmos.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music)
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
That it's not from the sport that anyone has come first, classifies, but from the done sport and generates.
positivity is positive for other people?
A sport that may be -
Then, when you think about it, it gives us the strength to move forward and the strength goes well.
You'll believe, believe it.
(Laughter)
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 104 Chileans that later turned into...
I don't know, I just got two, because Centro Quattro was a few, "No, I've got an agreement, I've got two, because I know an important number of six...
It's a number that will come back for more times, for the long time of this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All of us?
And competent?
While running is instead of being worried about the world.
To get the first ones.
In the last few years, we came together, after these 106 employees from Chile.
The journey is the difficulties already started during the first days, we were terrified in Windocca.
It's at the top, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough ...
We arrived at MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
A beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics for which they are not.
I chose this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet, this I know is an important number.
This is an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 Chileans all of us, we do it during our apartments, but the desert is generally, the curve is a bit like the metaphor of life, therefore, began to do things.
Later, the unexpected things happen in life, and even in the crop, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a garage, whether it's time to do something beautiful, you should go forward and interact.
There's always the chance.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
Lego, rain in vacation, healing the sun, (Laughter) He was heating the sun!
(Sound of soccer) I'm a member, smiling.
That's why the pleasure is palsine.
(Applause)
Thanks to everyone, like you've blowed up ... (Laughter) And you do things that mom did.
Okay.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) I never live.
Actually, I couldn't mold, I couldn't mold because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga.
An important initiative to help children.
I picked up glasses for the fight against neuroplastics.
The neuroplastom is a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unabled so many kids, I before this experience, I didn't know much about the existence, but unfortunately there are many, that are still in this moment bad, so my goal was to make these 116 km.
Following funds to give a sperm.
To these children, and when they're in the desert, it's complex to run the desert, because it's wisdom.
- My caldo.
Very calm, in the Namiba desert, in December, other stages, it ran with 61 grades, during the marathon of 42 kilometers, which was lasted as long as it was about 7 p.m., I had different issues, such as bracity, accuracy, and it didn't require that much.
Why did we have to move forward?
It's our garage.
When it's done, it's done, or nearly, this was at the beginning of the second cover, that USP.
A bit lighter, it becomes a km, so nothing dramatic, but it was a beautiful cover, a cover that started.
To make me think, a scale that also began to look at the seventh of the ground, the heat that was in a desert.
The province desert has taught me so much.
Well, we very often, well, to be ...
And we also feel during all of our things.
Build it, during all our work activities, of the inhabitable, right?
We feel inhabitable, we feel...
It was powerful.
But, unfortunately, in the desert you realize that you are a punctuate, and a punctuum, maybe around you, and I run around 15, 20 km, where there was nothing, and I also teach you that the things of a beautiful life.
I'm not just cellulare, I've invested the last fashion, absolutely many young people to be happy must have the cellulare, the last fashion.
And at some point in the middle of the desert, a night that was about to eat, it stopped.
Speaking from Pulmino, there was a script: in this desert, it's going to take a stove from a stove.
There's the door to this warning and says, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this wife."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, enjoy it.
And I don't know if you know that with salt ...
I can make them eat.
And I don't know if you know, but what is the result of doing medicine as well?
He was happy for his abuse.
Now we don't have to be happy, probably only for warning, it's good to be happy with many other things, but it's also important.
Sometimes, valuing how fortunate we are, the desert of amibia is the desert that I chose because.
Because inside the Nanamai Pesiste desert is the highest doll in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when we are there, we made it of race or almost.
It's strange, you can see it there on the tip of the gang, which then split from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because in my desert it doesn't exist, it doesn't.
So, when you know it out loud, it's amazing.
Being out on Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the owner, I was already in Chile, only 100 people were missing.
I'm Chilean.
We are already in Chile, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and the real sky.
[A.DE.]
(Applause)
[A.DE.]
[Inglese]: Sorry, mangan it, I took you 4 km/h of window window.
C: For me and my dad.
"Because I'm walking full... I'm an accent."
And nothing, thanks to all of you who are giving me strength, I travel, now I'm passionate.
MM: I must say a hail, come on!
Wow!
And I found myself in the desert.
Although this morning, as I was talking about the small principle of my well-being and I found ...
So many people with me have shared other 26 people, because it's not a big window.
With many contents: 96 were 96 people who had traveled with me, in the end, the last two km could also not do them.
The idea was that 104 had a long time, and at the end, a magic, an incredible magic.
(Audience) Wow!
Bambino 1: Eccolo!
As you can see, they were all very humble, the things also lasted because.
It was a bit rigid.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to get there.
To finish the ufficious lady, you can go back and do the other Chilean, then come back again.
To get to 1006.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to get to these years.
In other Chileans it's really inside, the number you know, a number you, always, important.
It's recurrent: the interesting thing is that we arrived at the end, and the sources racing, with the sources racing, was finished and achieved its goal.
In December 20th, 2016, if you take the figures, it's exactly the figures that make 116 km.
€16 per second.
200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for everyone, don't worry, you can also run, I was like this.
Maybe you have a little more, I had 40 kilos more.
Well, I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
We had, sometimes, captaining people to think.
I was surely facing 100 meters and I was already fatal.
I wasn't alone.
(Laughter)
"Ah! I don't know
Sorry.
(Applause)
Look: "Haha".
[Yes!]
I looked at a lady who had enough dance, I had two children.
A little older, Riccardo, already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
And Pietro?
And Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years of difference, this is the first day of school.
And nothing.
Ricking to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first element.
I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his place, Pietro Pan in Genegai, obviously he had already understood, well, the situation.
But, unfortunately, life sometimes threatened us difficult things, right?
This is life.
And a bit?
Like the corsa.
What you know how to react, and this is what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating hemorrhole, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, unfortunately Pietro had a super-runous malformation that we didn't know.
During birth, and it lasted hardly, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
(Laughter)
And...
And when?
When I looked ...
When it seemed like everything went well.
He's 18.
February.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack.
Because it was too stupid.
Okay, so ...
The garage is called Ran,16 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Clearly, it's not...
It doesn't.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but...
In these moments...
[A.DE.]
You don't have to let go.
(Laughter) (Applause) I'm continuing, but you have to continue.
We can continue to dare no more.
The strength is the one who is stretching?
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And Riccardo, keep moving forward in life.
See the chance to others, two that arrived.
Let's get to Emma.
Emma came on January 29th to San Pietro.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them.
We had to be positive, and anchoring couldn't beat me.
So I had absolutely had to do what?
Draw it...
Creating or improving my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but especially ...
From the physical point of view.
To give people strength, right?
It was to be me, stronger, and so I started running the first image I saw on record.
It's my first marathon mix, inside the Military Rena, and then another DNA.
A year later, the first marathon, the Royal Rena, will be very beautiful, and until it reaches this garage.
We ended up arriving in the desert of Namibia.
Does, as I said, these 16 Chileans have brought me to win this medallion, but to help us.
A lot of children, they also needed, and you can see the small house, that symbol I've had tattooed andosis, and I'm me, and I'm Pietro, and that's what I wanted to take around 21200 euros.
It's 2002 for two, because I didn't run by myself.
In the desert, I will continue to not run by itself.
And this year in November went into the Omann desert.
And Chileans are 165.
So here too, there are combinations of many - 165 kilometers completely in self-sufficience.
So they just gave me water.
We hope to get to the end, but the desert is different, but the objective is always the medesimate.
That is to get the money back.
To help children and help them do better.
The message that I'm here today is an important message.
- Yes, anybody has it.
The difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always a life expectancy for everyone, to do a lot of things, and to move forward.
Because life is a bit like a bottle, right?
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause) Good evening everyone.
And today we are here.
And today it's 17.
I know.
From 2017.
Three times I know, you see how ...
How do you want to interpret it, thanks to everything, (Applause)
