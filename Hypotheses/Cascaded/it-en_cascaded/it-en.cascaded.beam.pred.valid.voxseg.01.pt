In 2016, I was given a reward, from the out of a blind√ºlery force, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they are born at the ICIRO, let's imagine that this is a great university class.
He usually enters the classroom.
The first ten minutes, when the students come and are, focused on the ego of my computer speaker and put in classical music: I think this is the first step to create environments of less diverse and more resilient data, and try to keep the attention of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on the spot of everyone already: artificial intelligence.
And like all the stories I tell in children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
It's a second world war.
It's in 1942.
It's the UK.
Slothes and parts.
A residence northern Londra.
And there was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a special and enigma machine.
And it was a machine to write.
The operator digitalized tastes, but, older than stamping on a paper, those letters, are stamped out other letters, according to a code imposed on functionally under the hand.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper had in front of you a text without meaning.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main characters at Blesci Park, the one you can see behind, in order to decipher these trees written by youredes.
For this invention you think that the war is over with two years old, saving many human beings.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
So, with his Turing's machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article on Mind's magazine: computer and machine learning.
But where does your test suggest?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be a P?
Keep your head on a computer, asking questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a operator or a operator.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
It is said that the vehicle starts to overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers came from the vehicle and when the answers came from the worker: this is the limiting game.
Behind, the vehicle must have special characteristics to overcome the test.
Behind, it must interpret natural language.
And the question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
But you must argument in an automatic way to form these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence, one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts at the moment they get, or we try to modify our thoughts at a psychological level.
That's why it says that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues, according to this approach, the assignment that if we can have a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking, and probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates is dead.
This is a deductive argument.
From these two premature premises, it is due to a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the understanding of the logic of the thought, from here the logic of dots and transferred to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
An rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) You must act.
But they must adapt to the answer.
You have to set goals and know how to bring them to the end, and you must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote, can a machine think, we can say we can create a machine.
A artificial agent, capable of thinking, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
Through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, like psychological construction, once we have a great knowledge.
What about this?
It's about building intelligent and supported artificial integrity into the human, it's food.
But let's see today if machines think: I would like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence a little bit, and I would like to use five classics to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We submarine actors, human relatives, human beings, and superhumans, for example agents that deal better with all men and can't do better, for example, agents that resolve Rubik's cube, already with a fourth in the best way, and with a sad one, think that a year ago a young man has become in 4.73 seconds.
But do we have Sovans' agents?
That works better than all people, for example, in the game of the scats, in the game of the scanning, a few years ago, the facial trunk, wasted by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who act almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answer the questions of the physician.
We looked at the "min".
What do they do?
In the end, there are underground people who address today's possibilities, for example, in cognitive activities such as cultural words, or the classification of images, almost like all people, examples are the type of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today don't know how to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge like...
The candle, or are we talking about the bridge of Apple Corporation?
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest, the majority of artificial intelligence limitations, in which we think we're far from overcoming the avenue.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a facial line that indicates intelligence with an exponential apartment, this equipment follows the predicted apartment in the wall, for which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radioppy years and in quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to use this computational compassion to emulate the human brain: I don't need, in 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we could already be able to operate in a precise way our brain, and finally in 2029.
Behind, the machines will pass the test, they will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045, and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
Well, in his articulum.
According to mind rivers, Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against her same test, these observations are our observations against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago I was a student at the University of Varese.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the things we had to add was to a decimal observation against artificial intelligence, following a epistimology and ethical level of computer science, tired by the Lanzerone Professor, unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to promote, was formulated with an mathematical communication.
Take it out, stupidity, banana.
I want to describe it in simple ends, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, symbol of sound on the side of the equation, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it is also true that we left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story.
Relaxing ourselves to the first question: Can machines think?
I'd like to share with you an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
MM: OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having ever seen that he takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, I'm his contact on the market, I asked to share photography with me, that there is, in a difference, compared to the simple gesture, to prize a smart phone, or so contemporary, that changes his way of producing and authors.
To find answers around me, and I arrived to New York, to the desk of the New York Times Magazzi photographer, in Cathiryan, in Berlin, in the IM department, one of the greatest directors in the new market of Mobin Tok, to enter those places where photography is distributed and put in contact and to understand how the Mobbai photography transforms these ingrands.
(Laughter) In order to find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the biggest places that are visited in contemporary countries.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to be involved simply in a worldwide narcissistic delirium, like some sociologists have written with the basis of occupationality of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as an avocation of seventions, as an identitarian ostectation, as a subsidiary of their own imagination.
And that's how we are, the history of Mobile Fotography is short, but in a few years I've gathered millions and millions of people, a new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used every day to communicate and testimony ourselves, to nourish a large amount of images that put into communication individuals from an angle to another of the planet, this is my economic channel.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera, as the tip of a modernity which structures the work, the family, the coppy, are increasingly increasingly empty, and here are pointless in an immovement universe, spontaneously based on the gratification of our inner face of our daily experience that our need for sharing.
But on the other hand, try to think that the interaction can be direct through the photography of a dialogue, with a new model of New Smaking and I visited the Giornalism, this is the image of Cairo-Pensiti, a Museo Photografia @Ferbround, which has been moved by a quantity of professionals, like a new part of followed, of followed, of followed, of followed, of followed, of followed, of followed, of followed, in real time, in real time, in a photographer, and of followed, and followed on a photographer, and followed.
Brad Mengin, who used it for the photography of sport, exclusive territory, of photographs with hiper-performing appliers, and made a traffic of report, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempting and partners around her work.
People who use it daily to build their family album, establishing a reflection on how Instagram transforms our privacy's events, and the moment when anottor of bronics comes up and starts the image, translating a photographic experience in a pocket between analogy and digital analogy, far past and contemporary channels, what do these photos we don't know how to do?
To ask, going to the outskirts of the action, you can distinguish from the visive sound of the background that gives us the eyes, and all this belief, is still a difference between a photograph that was reinforced from the real, his biomassic, reproducing, his self-referent and sharing, with the earning, and seeing more than recording, and reaching different high demands.
And do you feel it?
You feel this.
What we believe is to be silenced, in fact, there are 50 meters of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered underdolly in our lives, waking up from the illusion that silence exists.
To me, that doesn't exist: so, in this room, those employees, these signs, and get home after a really stressful job magazine.
There's always the law, eat with your partner, with your partner, except, and then you'll get to bed in the midst of your identity camera and think you're on its own, and instead, come with your partner, in any case, but more or less this sound.
We have a positive side.
Well, or better, I start from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive side.
And we are never alone, in other words, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
But it's very, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/30, isn't more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Anchor.
I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a little specially, because my life was complicated, deciding to make music exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
But they divorced when I was a child.
And I know it, you think this is the classic strappalous story, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in the solitude of those days, in the burden of the root, of that house, I started to play music with everything around you, so ...
Every barefoot complements weren't anymore.
A classic complements of roots, fert, immobile, cousin of voice, but becomes my musical tool.
And with friendship playing with the other of my mom, that every eight is not hanging on her butcher, on the other side "Mammaciao," I was staring at the streaming, and this is a funny thing.
Of course, I said to a certain point: I tried to become a normal person, trying to say, "I did it because I started studying chitarra, pianoforts," and then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to stop the Clarinetto, the problem Arenzo Arbore really liked, who wrote a beautiful song, both ambiguous and ambiguous, coming to the first years of study in genius.
I also dropped the limb, right, so I didn't go.
My failures, my classmates.
But I dropped all that, because I studied and gave up that rigid notation, because there is more harmony in a rumor, and I like to complain it to the problems of life?
All of us have attached a rumor, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow in much more.
So here is my mission.
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
Ciaattoos.
I hope to say, to make a great turn to do it, toys, and everything would be conclusions, but no, I've been complicated this way of life.
But most of all, that's the sound, our inner eye, the catalogue of ossicans, our tax, reaches the maximum functional around the fifth week of gestation.
Because feet must be ready to what speterns in life, once born, must be ready to the dark texture, that means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before watching, and that doesn't have to fear.
It must be ready, so not in case if mom, during pregnancy, listened to Pancroco Britannic, there's no need to be stupid if the child, once he is born, will sleep to listen, for example, to Shakespeare.
So, the future and mum, I'm saying, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else.
But what's the sound?
And the sound is all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what happens in our lives is completely astronomy: you can't see it, you can't touch it, but it's the sound column every day, the doctor in our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journeys, because the visibility is much simpler, we know it, the aim is when we enter the existence captain, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
But more small than that: there is a smallest of the Militarian man, the smallest of San Pietro, the smallest of your house, maybe?
It takes the same thing as when someone saw me in video, I watched the stage, and then I came across many people and said to me, "But I imagined higher, right, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible, so, starting from this budget, the visitor?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the goal, is what allows us to dream.
Let's dream of imagining our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe, then we're in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we started taking photos of the feet, in the wisdom, then the election, Chileans don't exist, I lost the story, but it's multicanal, many sensors, but many, very few who are.
But nobody loses the damage.
We photograph it, we watch it, we make a lot of video, but we never stop listening.
We don't ever stop listening, but don't even have a person we know, and I show you something, when you touch them with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence that silence that between the other doesn't exist: there are two, listening, closing and listening.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, genuining your perception of listening.
For the first time, the school of myself, and I'd like to share with you the dream of my life, the dream of my life, that I was born, I wanted to go far away from the University, a series of failures, problems like others, here you decided to choose a city on Atlant.
And the whole part, really, from the side of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool, to welcome this musical instrument, decided to participate in a competition, they came into an artistic residence, the most beautiful years of my life, in fact, that for the first time I was listening, culturally, artisticly, and truly, far away from me, Shanghai, calling this project of Sound of City, and there was still the many.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where for 48 hours I didn't stop recording the basic sounds of the city, and I created a sound colony, so in this moment.
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
(Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium) (Sound of calcium)
(Pierre Jean-Pierre Bacri) (nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (Anglese) (Anglese) (Anglese) (Anglese) I'm going to be a little bite, I'm going to be a little bite.
I've bought the baby monkey, I've bought the baby monkey!
Difference.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
Ah!
I'm going to live, I'm an adolescent, I'm going to live in Time.
I sleep.
Tchip, bip!
Okay?
Doct!
(Laughter)
Alla.
Hello everyone!
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test, it wasn't true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, it was all exposed to the visitor.
Now, there's a city that is certain, you've been photographed all the way, and you're more than once, but at that smoke, which goes down in the tombs, which are founded, but the bridge of Brooklyn, can completely resonate in the leg.
And what about the desire to join them?
Thank you.
I believed Al Counter that was truly harassed to a fridge and something very important to say.
Hello, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
But the rule of "fundo a siti" is 48 hours, without sleeping directly to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova, I knew Genova, because there are capabilities many times, there are potentially captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, I promise you.
Good afternoon.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sons gave me the data of these children, that in this iron pipe, portable, have given me this helpful camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Five, I'm gold.
Salt, to the span of...
Great.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
MM: OK, Geneva is Mordandis.
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a battle, that's one thing would be, anyway.
Because the writer, which you can see as easily in the Ferrari desk, is not just a writer, for me is a great musical instrument, and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony, and it's more or less like this.
Well, the last one, after I really wanted to talk about Genova, is that of all the bars of the pork.
That we are exposed to look beyond, but the sound of a ghetto that gave me particularly a frequency that became the melody, and so I created this microphone immersed for 48 hours in the port of Genova, and I found a sound of a perceive that transformed into what the voice providing the sound of the son.
How many are they?
It's true, beautiful, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
That's the sound of our passions in my and in your lives, and for how many people will say they're rumors, they're out of time, they really want to hear them, and I'll give you back to school, thank you!
As Guy Beck said in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea is, in general, the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to the benefit.
AC: Many times, instead, the restitution is connected to restiting what you did, what you learned.
And from the part of those who say, "We don't do anything," then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post of 18 minutes shared some of this story.
(Laughter) By the end of the 90s, mainly, this is my son's thread, he came back next to sewing, and in the same year, my female engineer organized the money to pay the asylum's school, it was an activity.
Very heavy, and with many parents, some of them also said, "No, because we need to help, we should think about the Comum State," but most of them were extraordinary for helping astronomy, to help us the Commune State, because you don't know 100 euro from then.
And it was one of the strengths of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we went to the United States, this time is similar to the same school as a school in the neighbourhood. This is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explained that it's a totally ordinary reality, that is the thing of 'giveback' of the restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole society: I said this to the restitution, I've had a fortune, I am part of the school, I enjoy the university, along with the museum, theaters, there are all the communities supply to live voluntarily, there are processes, there are no basis on this, so the effort is a phenomenon that is a positive circle.
The seat says, "Desistemis Dion is now."
We are already expecting, very actively, to ask ourselves, "System is one of the moment."
A famous baking lotter Obama was an incredible technological debt.
They build a study that doesn't work so many millions of situations, and this is the standard answer they got, soon, critical doesn't end up for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal, by trying to do and help, which is extraordinary, technological experience, for us, is not a common thing.
(Laughter) This is the copertine of Time Magazine, which reinforces the savings of technologies that have been sent by Google and other companies, there are fert, and agree with the white house, they have re-architect, markerch, has put in functioning the Site in just a few cities, to one decim of the costs.
Maybe many of you would have thought, but Google probably has its own interests, and it's what I want to explain to you about what it was wrong, I've spite of people who hadn't learned a lot about their lives, who had this suit, this bag, and they've decided to repeat the experiences they'd made of their lives.
But in this case?
But they keep the ability to manage great, technological systems, complex processes, flexible, and reproduceible.
And making them again reproduce and tangible, and creating a replicable system that is the YOSD of Torris, from this effort, has been born a replicable system, what we expect to do as well.
But I want to suffer with the word models, because we also impose the models, the ones that have taught perseverance, the desire to never make any mood, to continue to insist, energy, empathy, so these are the models that are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to rest.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we've said until now, but also Italy, I wanted to do it: almost 20 years through school, the idea of going back to help was even because they're Italian, two World Dirisno Tright Worlds.
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meetings without Francisco, and we've seen it in the mass in business, and in Silicon Valley, sensitive to the need of transformation in general, to those things that have affected us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of public recording public, asked me why he couldn't help us during an year's trip for a couple of years: I think, we reflected, the payment with my wife, Monica, and talking to my capo, Jerpeso, in order to make it short, I decided to apply a methodology to find out, I couldn't, or I could, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't give up, or can't get informed, or can't get informed.
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years, in the Amazon roof.
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
But I was mentally convinced about chooticism and bureaucracy, people asked me, "But what about the disaster of this disguise, and I didn't expect, obviously?"
But authenticism isn't often about sexism, that makes you feel a certain mentality, you never change it, obviously you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind, and in this country there is a lot of common sense.
It's about doing things because you think of helping, improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, like a mass commissioner, I say this because it's the title of great, my children, and then, immediately from the beginning, of extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to assume some people from fuel of public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems inside don't transform themselves, we want to try to transform them with people outside, where the fact that we don't know the public administration is a sign, not a beach, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so it can afford it.
Here you see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't scratch what I think will happen, in this way we can see such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
Straneously, it has a compense, and it's probably much better than what you see, and I'm convinced, so I came up with the idea: but how do I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that faithful photograph of beauty, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, has given the phone kids, in all the United States, in this sport, massic and investments, infrastructure?
We've created the vision that the country's operative system, a series of fundamental components, which can build more efficient practices for citizens, public management and companies, through innovative digital products, a very beautiful vision of documentation, is fencing and blood.
I've continued in my place, a field of business in salt, but that American future, if I don't agree.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we had to learn how to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of us have already experienced many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And I am still, we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be ugly and prejudice, the critics of the first type riding from people who really want to offer sponsorships to their contribution and we treat them a lot.
The second guy, the people who want to defend the status quo, is that they're always the animal that is flight, or that they're simply addressed to the impointment, and that's our problem: to re-oach the things that don't work.
You remember this picture, the first time, men and women in the hall of Time Magazin.
Here's here, so, although he tried to memorize as much as possible people among chlists, I got around 3,000 questions, of which, at least hundreds of them qualified, we used digital resources for chlids, an app that's called Jazz, we put it online on the Govern Sea Sea, we did a math test and a third of the technological part.
(Laughter) In fact, we're talking about hydraulics.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should be interconnected, it's silos that they don't know.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their suffering and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
And it spends the survey of the public administration public, of course, of software, and there's a lot of activity in management project, so many legal activities we can't also have a litre, but without the tubes you can't take the breast.
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we said, "The Spanish piano, public administration, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in my situation, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the trential piano requires a team game to simplify amministration public, the city of the citizens, particularly the piano's life, has been added once a year because the kids couldn't be, especially in technology, and they appreciate to records.
It's reassuring the technological rules and the rules of its own potentially three warning wages and connecting to other agencies in another region, and at some point there are the technological rules that are quite incomprehensible: unfortunately we can't improve it.
And instead of thinking in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the inhabitant platforms, these are competitive platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in horizontal all the public recording activities: the more there will be electronic, electronic cards, an informable fire.
But the best project that we followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population: "Oh!
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I have to become a citizen of an island, the motorization of all those posts, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
But we're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
But two weeks ago we made a Seria Akaton.
It was done in 25 Italian cities, without San Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from the technological point of view, like from the state.
All of this constructs, that we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the beautiful territory of Italy.T, where they're wovened, all documentary, in all the code, but more and more, of applications.
Well, from the Italian administration public, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little, I was also working on other projects that supply don't limit themselves to do as an iraulic, I entered the ball as well.
It's already functional, but the tables are being composed, let me disappoint you, this might be, for example, one of those things briefly, to increase the warning version, the alpha, or a digital citizenship, the phone, the smartphone, and the interaction of three citizens, the public recording public, with a little money: we're dreaming a little because work we're doing so much, but it's due to this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
(Laughter) In computer about 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that we expect, I asked many people to talk about what they think could happen, I asked me to talk about basic simplification of life of every day of citizens, I took the occasions to write an article that I want to give you some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
A country in which they read and recognize and promote the right to innovate, to prevent building it.
Being, a country wants technological competitions that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public recording is a weorean, where the Human brains are better fans to work in public research centers that are seen and proper centers of eccellence and innovation that leads development to the country.
Now I'm a dream.
But if you don't have a dream about how to punish hardly you can do things.
To conclude, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
And here, somewhere in this theater between the other, at this point, but it's more quiet, and you haven't managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital transformation team, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our brain is our social system.
And what if I had the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
Then, what will you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're afraid, they're keeping you, it's for that, well, because here's behind the soap there's.
Then, raise your hand those who would change something about your body, maybe lose some thread, or maybe win your muscles.
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom: raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want.
I was sure that I'd all be here, or maybe you'll be one of those who will change.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question: let's try not to change each other, and the answer was different because the elementary school would have a more united family, but my parents don't separate.
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
Liceo would have felt the most complex professors, it seemed to me all eyees and reflected me in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Before the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I had to fight and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't move me well, what others thought of me in the great economical sides, in the interpersonal relationships with characteristics of my birth, when I was a psychologist.
Instead, I carried out my research also to other people, and I realized that them, like me, used mainly three strategies: these strategies were used in small dose, could also bring some benefits, but, as most of the cases were the only three drawings of playing in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a good thing but end up keeping their problem in life.
The strategy, today, the broader, is to get lamented.
And we're lamenting a little bit of it.
Because there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, fred, that I'd done differently, we'd sorry because there's no injustice, we know a lot of people who go to the remote of the table, and the problem is that if they concede mental space, this paralyzes you, hypnotize and fits to the mankets.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything that was to get bothered, from when I started talking, when I stopped to return home, she had started the love of a young boy, who was lazy, and then of the young girl with whom she had translated it.
So the fact that he didn't have a job, the last national ship that didn't help him, felt worthwhile, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized all his daily life, because with a small effort can obtain a great result.
But do it well, you can lie to the behave, or as it is much more often happening, you can lie to the right, by yours, or with friends, high voice or in your mind, because all of us would have so many reasons to let us lie down.
But the truth is that as much as you're forced to memorize hardly something around you will change, old, there's no other way to pay more attention to what's in fasting.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, it's that of lamenting, let's press that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair from the top to the magnifying glass.
Through very tiring strategies, when things are constantly streaming, it's that of giving up our necessity, based on this mentality, we've learned that if something doesn't okay, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being, what surrounds us, doesn't like us, it's from those who rule this antibiotic.
Then, you felt a bit dirty, but why can we never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it?
Your wife breaks you, divorces you.
Allowly, let's take a look at how much rising it is: your child doesn't listen to you, not to you.
(Laughter) And too big, we couldn't lead him to the psychologist. We are here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, I chose him for this, this profession, to make the world around you get involved in the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships ofppies.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I wasn't doing anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
Your left.
Well, it's certain that, to conceive you, but not even to prepare yourself in the gym, afterwards, it's a classicone, and it's not, if you don't listen to me, if any other way or another would come to me uncontrol, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to be, to rest our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing we say it often in good feet, believing deeply, thinking about a couple of times, because you will give a life full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there are no tools, like a tool, take the forehead, put it underwear.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of altruistic needs.
I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, whose end of the first childhood had learned to district with a great degree between the kids of mum and dads.
I hope to spell on the moon that as soon as I was confronted with those who would have lost the love of others, in this limited situation.
There are important things that I learned, for example.
To listen to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no to the things that didn't happen to them, he didn't learn to say no to the things that didn't happen to them, and the need to count how many.
If the strategy that privileges, when things are not as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, I will finish to disrupt them.
To regret this, it requires your needs or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause-skinned cognition, because I myself in my life will be abused.
I tell you what happened to me.
And one day, the primary school for which I was working on sent me to call and said, "But Zuccelli, there's no place for her.
If I'd like to continue collapse with us, I'd have to accept a disturbance and show me a far away, spermful place, I'd go even further, I'd have to go there to do a job that wasn't even a big deal with everything I'd studied until then.
Then I got to know how to die, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never have to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
And there I learned that to obtain different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
And to change ourselves.
What if I had changed?
But the others would also have to follow, change, change.
If I became a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, my primary school wouldn't have sent me a way, if I had done it, things wouldn't take me more than that, but perhaps I would have gone to me, first, I wasn't that person.
But the answer wasn't in the hill of others, but I had to ask my responsibility profound.
Why are things?
Behind, it doesn't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
And choose the places as a cause of things that don't go as a path.
Keep in yourself as a cause of things that don't go as far as you are.
This is our bifth.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I will only find answers and will help confront something much bigger, if read books, go to courses, acquire new abilities, or consolidate those who already has, is the basis of the crisis, what you want to do, but if instead of you, and think of being perfect that maybe there's a margin of change that might be improved, then they open the doors in front of you, because life is of those who don't do it, because the moment is.
And if inside the tank, things don't go well, you think that it's the other side to where to take the first step.
And in this way that I create a mental space, I used to go to the research of his needs, now you see the research of his needs, then things change, what I can do today as a different way to make the best journal, and then try to operate to satisfy them, and I'm staying it, and maybe the own relationships each day this simple question instead of making the war.
I don't know one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, prostitute and relaxation.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do, if you're part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become a role model, but the friends of problems.
Stereots, prejudices, psychologists are the doctor of the mates, psychologists are the doctor of the debts, but they had to talk to a friend, but they go to the barbecue, but what should I do, right?
I had to get lamented or maybe not to explain how many good psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to give up my dream: No, I had to learn to speak a language, which was not happening, but near the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs, instead of being mine.
Little time following this instruction?
I achieved the results for me inimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and in the end I decided I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he intended, I came back here.
I got to the case, I killed the computer, and I recorded a video that I've cartooned on YouTube in which I spoke about psychology, here, in the head, I learned how to pick up the anxiety, because they're probably thinking.
And as time went by, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy for the purpose of video psychology. Thanks to this, every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting into discussion some of the stereotypes I had just given you: recently, a review that from 1974, I am from Google, psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in Italy, and what has led me more about everything.
Well, don't become real because, fortunately, why did you get that chance?
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps you hold and makes you move forward, the ones who don't know how to build and need to reflect, because the culprit should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your bones of always, here.
If there's something I've learned from all this journey that helps me.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must warn to our internal: ten motivations had asked a question.
If I have the chance to express a desire, only one thing to change a aspect of your life, that doesn't come as mixed up, that would change, we talked about the work, the physical aspect, the current narrative.
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least proveing, it's a small question that I personally was very useful, and that is based on the logic that, in order to produce great changes, you're focusing on so many actions.
What's the simplest thing and the simplest thing?
What will you do until now, at the end of the store, tell you in case after this beautiful newspaper and that will allow you to take the first step?
That's not the case.
To put your life into the directing here to collapse.
And you can think: What's the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions that are both?
See, do you have the keys of the frugone, the one who is eating today or is now part of the pullman, ugly, but where do you put the packs, or do we fly the odds?
Or on her feet, which is now about mutating?
Oh, you see, when I arrived to my mother, do you know what?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And I put it aside.
Well, this time I want to take this by myself, here.
But I had a dream.
to create an integration band, diversity, and various abilities, percussions are so fast, so immediately, take up the distances and join the battles.
But we are part of it.
We are part of the sets.
With these kids, I see them, eye, Laura, fear of my pictures, I saw them growing, our provides were marriage, the marriage was the day of providing, where she entered this room at the Andreoli School.
They were picking up the first bidonies, he was together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become a group marathon, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw the first ones, the first marriages in the sinkets, the first satisfaction, the first meetings.
GV: The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012, the world was crossed, in the real sense of the word.
Tutts of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake we filled our land, and from that moment on, we were the thousands of earthquakes.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I mentioned, the cases were no more accessible, many crooks: our room provides, our place where ...
But where all marriages were found was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
The endless voter, the erlopi.
And we made it.
Luckily, we all found them.
We are all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of demonstrations, of thousands, inside that stone, came out of magnificent things.
We saw the fear coming stronger, it kept us in the eyes, with the Earth that washed, to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
There, we've built the first tools: sci-fi belt.
I have become the advertising categories.
These are the tubes that have become?
From the building and combined with ping pong roots, to take out bills with markets, shoot.
We were in a continuous job, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already there, our first spettacol was born, while the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to speak for 20 years, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We began with the construction of the first spettacol: white man, because there were smaller lights, the larger lights and the white man, at that moment, we all moved together as a white lighter.
After that, we did ...
So the year later we did the other spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also have a moment from our land, to breathe for a moment.
And last year after we were cracking, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought that a tone could change our lives.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 impacts in return to the state.
The stage of the first master?
The concert on TV program at a friend's house is the school stage, and we really did a lot.
And also for me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly me.
It's exactly the circumstances of life, that of fatigue, of sudden, but also of freshness, that has so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back to the seeds, they expect that there is still so much to build, thanks to everyone.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until the moment I realized what happened in the last 250 years: there are 250 years very important that have changed our history radically, and that we live today.
We talk about social innovation, and my question is: Is there this social innovation, and especially our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be treated around innovation?
This is the digital photo: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, I believe so everyone.
However, these three factors together, joining mobility, make us enter a new era, which, in fact, adds a technological evolution that belongs to the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution, and the phone, and then the vaporean motor, entered the chordodonifies, entered the Industrial Revolution, in some way, storically committed, and began to change the modality but not mature.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
For example, we need to, for example, the automobilical industry. Actually, it used the naval industry, because motorcycle was a motorbike that couldn't be anyway, when it wasn't able to understand how to save the script to turn it into ferths and advertising it with the spreading that developed the automobility industry, and all that was produced, but not only.
And in the Industrial Revolution we are still debates, for example, for the phone, it is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to reveal our letters, from one part to the other of the world, always smaller than we knew.
But it's also what permits us and has taught us to deposit the caves?
And under the sea.
And yes, because after the phone we could try it in the sea, and then what we had to interrupt everything: no, we had to move forward, we had to digs under the sea, the first cave left.
And we're around 1858.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, continental energy in Europe, and now Rinascente has been built in 1873 by the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, the scat was illuminated.
And a part of our history has swimmed my I.
But let's move forward, we tried to make some more significant income, always more structured, but we started to lose something, to compare something that wasn't known, among the factors that in the beginning of the 50s, they could be in a room like this, and they had less ground functions, but at some point it decided to open these letters.
And these laws called ARPA, ARPANET on the Internet, started to bring information to collect information, in 1995, there were 25 million, a system diffused, oral, non-archical, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of tens of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to copy data, to collect data or to develop data.
When the functional strength, which was replaced by the concept of industrial revolution, began to disrupt artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
That's a industrial process that tells us that what's new, progressively, does what's old, because we've lived right now: that we're living right now, what's called the Internet, we've had the urge that, if little, we've started to live the urge we've lived now, is about to accompany.
It was 1863, when, from the scale, I still haven't done the Italians yet.
And the Minister Minghetti, given the entrance exams, establishes that the 27th century of the doctor, is free, the payment is public dependencies.
And from 27 of the successive months after this happened, in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the less risky stages of the sanitation, somehow started to move away from the land, and especially, has transformed the economic power of power of production of goods and strength in the power of producing a good, the money.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also the industrial system that allows us to keep in a massive way, a structured way, in a healthy way, in the quantity of food.
So there is also the chance, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the emergence of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live at the end of the 90's: these are us, the speed, the speed of the actions, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there is a figure that has characterized these years, that is, a element that we can define as the qualificator of these years, in the length, as we said, arrived the computer and had access to the Internet, but we are very fast.
And until when something happened, basically it's close when you keep the story, to understand the messages from one seventh to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2001, when we can say it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that are significantly indicating the passing of one hour or another, 2001 because in total.
Because the American economy started to slow down, the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in the balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
But there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was already overwhelming, they don't talk about it, but still there.
It changed something, but something has changed, changed the economical paradigm, we couldn't.
But let's not wait for the biggest economic crisis, which was indeed verified in 2008; it was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension, when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
What did those companies do, they didn't innovate in inventing something, they didn't innovate in building something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done to buy and sell, travel, learn, learn?
And in a different way, in a more efficient way.
And the adventure, the idea that often is considered, is so much and little, not yet something, according to human abilities, human resources, ability to heal it, to be different from abilities based, the abilities based on what allows us to develop.
The use of the Internet, frankly enough to look at the newspapers and see that we're growing fast, there are new openings, new operators, new competitions, and it's building tables, so businesses, a third fact that we have to look at the use for everyone, all and five elements that are in a growth, and the inclusion of the fact of growing completely athetic until two years ago, so we're denying the European countries and this is not so little.
Actually, a very profound change has been brought to the biggest multinationals, and there are competences and digital inclusion in Brazilian factors, and in this way we have to pay a lot of attention, not significant to large internationals, in fact.
The only thing we have to do is to insistently apply to competences in this reality, because these reality can become the viable multinationals of Times, which are all these multinationals that can be used.
It's an interaction of the market in an extraordinary way, creating ricks for all the thesis around you: a nature's heritage, for its existential nature, thanks to an analytical heritage, and there's an analogical heritage, we can't digitalize crossing, sale, signs, Rome and then distribute, but the riches of these three cities don't make the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've had the time to start, but we're speed to recover, to include this patrimony within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it away and to spare it from being black, and to bring the tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all of our country, I believe that this is the great pill that we can do in our Italy, greater.
Fitter has drowned me.
I'm going to talk about in a certain sense and the opposite of the word that identifies all this discomfort, and the opposite of the word "share", because I'm going to talk about inequality and I'd like to start in a new way.
But according to you, in the last 20 years, we'll say in the 21st century, maybe the answer of many would be: they've increased, if then, maybe, of the journalists, maybe you'll add the following agenda to bright, perhaps the majority of you would also answer?
I've been asking these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the performance of video, I've prepared with my colleagues a report on inequality, from when they are data, which is to support from 1960, to the highest majority of countries in the world.
And the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
In Italy, from the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90's, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second republic, and in Italy, from the end of the year 2000, the aggressive inequality between the citizens of the world has crossed and precipited, now we are at the storic mining.
CR: We have a trend of inequality in the growth.
And how can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is to say: we've put a complete alcohol in order to keep talking about years of increase in inequality in how data can't support our feelings, and there's certainly in this letting.
But we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are ourselves?
We tried, the feeling wasn't wrong, but maybe the idea of inequality in which we think is wrong.
(Laughter)
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality about what we want to say about inequality, perhaps the thing of inequality is filled with some reproduction, and we move around a century.
And in addition, we moved to Cambrici in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was actually a week of 15 hours of work pronounced, in that occasion, the first one said, "There was a section of a while there, in other words, little to 100 years old, that would be in bed, but with all this time we wanted to use it either or not."
G.G: Well.
Apparently, your second trust didn't become true, because we see it all that we don't work, and it doesn't seem like we work three hours a day.
I'm going to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're convinced that it's not done anywhere, we'll see those succession in Italy.
This one is...
Your life naturally is potentially working, that is, for 15 years now, when we are able to accomplish a job, well, if we keep this trajectory, it is the fraction of time that an Italian means devote to work throughout our lives.
Then, to work and now we call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
I have two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Well, naturally.
If this happened, there are also reasons for the last year, in the 90s, there's another reason, then very positive, and other bananas, if you're ovview and if you want to be banal, up to 25 and 30 years, so young people get stung, but there's a much more important reason for them.
Here's our quote of time.
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see that...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
AC: Today.
We are around 50 feet percussions, we are very low, we are around 50 feet; it means there are more people who don't work, not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't see any income, are more workers.
FdB: Is the frontier of this?
Farming action: we can also have a reaction.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation in Italy.
And there were conflicts: this is the storic series of time.
According to the work in life, as you can see, in the United States only goes to the '30s, it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while we believe it, but even more impressive, and the storage amount of the occupation rate, as we can see here.
There is an increase, the pictures you see underwater is the crisis of 29: we have a general trend of the rate of occupation in the USA to the economy, in this case, we have a situation of reducing the rate of occupation.
But then, this idea of learning is a pathology.
But it's not normal, isn't it?
Yes, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
And it's not normal that most of the population lives in a sentence I defined -
But regarding parasity, dependency, because depending on the network of Twisia, this to you can also be a family member or the State.
(Laughter) But helplessness, because I consumed the available income without working.
But me, a friend who did theatre's work, when I found these results, we went to the scene and I asked them to do it.
And you, as you showed this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence, and you know what answered me?
With Epopopotam, it's the moon that lives on the backs of the hypothama, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, here, here.
(Laughter) If you want to have an idea of how buffaging or buffaga on the other side, or on the other great mammals, these birds also live on the sidewalks, on buffets, we have this movie that will take place for some of them in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What catches the plants, these murderers?
How do you live?
Anyway, this is on the resources that the water provides, that are in six larvae, and that everything that host on the golden bump isn't clearly that I've done as a sociologist.
Society signals, like fedal society where there is an object that has to fit in condition, but naturally it's not enough, we must add a qualification: this is, indeed, a conviction.
Because it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
(Laughter)
Because consumers are more than producers: in the sign language society is simple, classical, we have the signs and the serves of the store produced for him, in society and rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and suffering.
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the idea would define a damaging relationship, let's see why.
FdB: The relationship?
The buffaco with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food located on the therapy, the disadvantagy indicates.
Because we can't, we can'tpower, we don't need buffes, but it's also from the perspective of producers, we also have a face slope, a green slope, the hypothms and automo don't need buffes, but it's somehow a very complex requirement, and this is a situation of tweet lips, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
This is a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we come to the question that I've done talking about Keynes: today, the real inequality is of access to work, the access to work is far asmetrical in our social system, but if inequality is the inequality of access to work and a lot asymmetric.
It is measured by inequality that we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have the means of work, who have a job that has both workers.
And the position of the adventure, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic, the position of the year is to be lost in the graduation, together, in the country reaches mass, but simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, probably, would be the palm of what the doors are.
This is the best situation, that of Norway, with the United States in half.
[A.DE.]
To become an Ox country, normally, seven million jobs.
As we arrived at this, this is the history of inequality in access to work in Italy, always measured with the efficient decent, you can see somethingamorous, that inequality is the minimum during monarchical age, especially under the second Republic Republic that the in which we live in and is massive in our families.
And it would be 1,000 euro per month, and in addition, it would be 12,000 euro income approximately.
In the year, and our state would be around 150 billion euros as much as health and school has been put together, more or less in Italy.
CR: But it's here concluded.
But there's one.
AC: Hi.
We are the only country that has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Paese refugee together with the Turkish of the West.
So, or we change things, and we create the seven million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article of Costitution, and things are like BEFA and ARSR.
