Controlated.
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently far away: Be, you must know that until some time my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to sleep, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
But the words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, there was a little girl called Teresa de Calcuta.
And this little girl says, "Daddy, when?
One day I'll wait for a child, what happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said, "Madre Teresa, but what a beautiful word of freedom?"
(Laughter) Instead...
The child thought, "I'm not.
It's interested.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble, but the desire for this young man to try the battles he had written, the fights with them was too big, and he didn't think, "So everybody, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the Internet that my first words as you've just said were web, web!
Then it was like this: people would laugh, and he was happy because the words used, fluid, in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was something extraordinary, but the most beautiful thing.
It was that this young man, at that time, that people didn't laugh anymore.
They were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mother would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
That's not the case.
And, in other words, they would get the best of themselves.
And if it also worked on the contrary, what is a moment, I talk about my reliability and they take them out the best part, and then, I become a volunteer in a house that hosts people with disabilities.
[A.DE.]
It worked: people, all the people I've met, who have become part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
Then, who is a genius?
Or it's becoming a genius: generating.
Disability.
Well, this is the biggest one of the pairs.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
It's on paper and it reads trisomy, adventure.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
"Mommy freezes."
A: Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) The doctor, subsequent, sign, maybe he didn't understand, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "No doctor, I've understood very well, but I only wanted to know if our son is a mask or a female," and the doctor is always more spoused, close.
And then I, as a matter of qualma, pork, misery, we don't even know when we managed to make a mask out of nothing, but it's dark.
And the dot has given the head to the dot.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
AR: We get to know this very well, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult one.
Also our lives, because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, after a few months.
Anna has arrived, it's here, I introduce it.
(Applause) A marvelous one!
It's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
Now this is not the potential.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, how they're fat..." And then, this one says with Down syndrome, for example, you know that they use more chromosomes, I don't know, I'll give you an example, you have TED talk, adding a little X.
[A.DE.]
No, why am I showing you this example?
Why you?
Because you, today, to know TED, talk to people, have made a little bit of fat, here's the invitation to make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life, both persons, but also from people around you, a very hard advertisement.
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to give us a step forward, a grader underwater, here, in order to wake up the eyes, you have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me to often lose, in this sign.
In sign language, signs are the word disability, so I can't just allow you to look for paths of disability in your life, to enhance them and more importantly.
And remember that the paintings that you watched in the face are truly brave, thanks to your heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like the masoce, that I saw, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple way, it changed my life, and I understood what my mission in the world, but in an internship, it captured me, how many of how much it takes to each day, how much it takes a night thanks to a traffic, and what is what happened to me a safe, thanks to a traffic.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable, just leaving food.
Why food?
That's why I believe it's important to be, if not another perfectly aware of the choices they make each day, and not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices that each day produce a large part of our daily environmental impact.
My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
Mr.C.
Another thing of consumers also is to optimize consumers, and especially the way in which we compose the bact every day, theattoo, so, what are we, effectively, bringing it to the cake?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
And the scary, so the less noble part, is in average to at least 50% in winter, we arrive up to 70 feet, because a lot of vegetables have more protected areas.
So what does it mean to optimize in the kitchen means to have a different approach, to see all these parts as together, let's take an example with the candle: me, I can see it as a group of four ingredients, for example, a chicken.
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us a cut, a cake.
By the way, maybe, if you don't like too much damaged by the chicken, you can concentrate on the bus, and it's also using the use of thedominal intelligence, for example, I think that, for example, another example, a professional instrument of 2,000 euros, but it's the thing that I like very practical, so to optimize your ow, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, for cube, and for some, it can't be cute.
And truly, when they could put the keyboard, for example, of the forests, of the fish, in fact it's too much overwhelming, eating so many vegetables, and in fact, we take a large part of our daily life's protein because I've inserted this thing in environmental impact.
(Laughter) It also means that we can reduce our environmental impact, and above all try to eat them as quality, and as much as possible, protecting animals with low environmental impact, this is the problem that, even more if we do it at the global level, even in sphere, public policy, for society, and a benefit that all of us will find a few less proteins in theattoo.
Well, in other words, next year there will also be HECPO, and there are a lot of people speaking about food of the future, I can say so much about insects, personally I believe I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we are not a consumer country, but here is a representation that we can't stop self-producing, which is part of the Italian tradition.
And here in the room, who among you has never eaten the lights?
Okay, those who wouldn't eat them, you see, maybe ten years ago, a law that prevented us from recycling them, we were also lunch rooters, but only to be appropriated from the lighting producers in Italy, not only to evaluate it, but also for the cosmos and for other uses, but it's a food that also requires chefs.
Simple, but I'm a very optimistic and Bourghignon, the French seats or richer a stranger, so united to me became revolutionary, and two times in the year you will have your rooted in a primary, like an ortagger, ask you a time of covering around an hour and then you can do what you wanted, so, for our happiness and our planet.
Wow!
QD: I brought two data with me.
One, no?
A piece of data with six faces, take part from one to the other.
The other one.
But he went with ten gangs: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing?
Now let's play: you'll launch your side for ten gangs.
And I can do it.
Let's start this game, put an equal or largest number of mine.
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
To win with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on the experience, I explain.
But I can completely release data and take the data of every victory.
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventh seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you will realize that the probability of victory is around 75%.
But with the remote increase, my stomach based on the media of the succession.
It gets more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
Later, if you had a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer, your port must deliver 100 million data in a single second.
This kind of issue has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called the Monte Carlo method for this ability in computer to simulate the case, it is a powerful method, we can simulate a data release, but also a fluid behavior, or the development of a colony of battery of an epidemic.
Or even the abandonment of financial systems.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To be a kind of magic, and for this, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
The environment of work at exceptional levels, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary level of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and humanity, unbeatable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
And the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time alone on a computer or on a statistical background.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach them: I was so tight, they think they were teaching math and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson.
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending.
Everything that I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I wasn't interested in answering this question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's why I joined my degree, I started to live as a lesson in education, and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to be a solitary preparation, I wanted to compete with my students, to be able to convey them, to convey them, to make them fun.
I tried to take advantage of all opportunities, I got a diploma in didacts with university students, and I began to teach two hours to student from the first year to more than twenty years to births of more advanced things.
But the majority of the workplace, the more I became efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
I had realised in every aspect of learning.
(Laughter) Preparing with education is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
(Laughter) I like it to pick up my compounds.
To read the lessons to the students, the right mistakes they are, provides a continuous learning.
Then, there is the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman, and the opening to each store, the lesson is my protocol.
The gratitude of the students paying for my whole career, and I was talking about them, as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my doctorate, I had so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way, I was experiencing something that works in large scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
That's how I talked to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, that fuel, that dissemination?
The place I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing themselves to such a value situation.
Is there a concert?
FdB: Well, State, at this event.
Or a stone, a book, a trip?
Or an experience, an operation, a moment of silence.
Behind, a passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind will be in motion when I was trying to put in motion the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
But, as you've understood, the journey of learning is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But let's see, I told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
And then passion followed, as catalizers of our talents, that we weren't expecting it, and then passionately, as catalizers of our talents, and the culture of sharing.
There's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams: there are more richer than the students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
In his face of the time, I cut myself off the voice, there's already silence.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some instructions about women's questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to witnessed the friends of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could see him in election, another one of the few youngsters, and I asked myself where to find other exercises to prepare.
(Laughter) It's true, we had recently had some time to practice, but there's a lot of material on the Internet, and I had to find it on the rear of the pantalla.
I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
I scratch to the food, but I often live to them to ask how to procedure, to each point of practice, we build a element of theory that we repeat the stages together.
Anyone was a very difficult question, but I had spent the afternoon on their testo book, they were well prepared, I had it.
I start with them to make them take the breath: it's a saying, fly, I bring them up to the glass for the exam.
(Laughter) A group of students breastfeed, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
I've got money.
But he teaches him how to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
Alright.
Take the courage, just to tell me.
But I just want to thank you.
Why what do you do for us?
But don't do it.
S: I stay in the classroom, and I have a huge smile, a bigger heart, and I think maybe...
This is exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
Well, this is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are connected widely, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside the country.
(Laughter) I'm a mind runs.
G.G.
Hail!
They are completely prepared for art, asking for our love to donate on the model of the beginning, research has a movement and supported by the evolution of Bafco's body, and they start to make the bathrooms grow, we do a self-vember, very precisely the Bapco's frames, where Movender, and the mosca at Trento, Teddo, Tedarch Cirento, Tedarch Cirenternovender, in more than 219 million Salt.
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
And that's how a bit of freshness came into a bar, I wrote a book.
What's interesting about the change is that, as the law has already told us before, it's as often as it captivates me, when I read and bite something, it's normal that you have to do something, but in reality, when everyone approaches the change, the first thing that you have is beyond fear.
And the opportunity seems that here, right now, instead of diversity, you feel far from the objective, feel your diversity, experiencing your diversity, you feel this change, you are bringing a lot of people, you are a lot of people with different intelligences, each one of which has more intelligences, and you feel that in this change you are covered all that has been different, remembering one day my daughter.
Alright.
It's a mom at home, we have a family of friends, girls, so at some point the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Of course, we are really three men," and he says, "No, they both love each other."
So this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and that's the difficulty a little, but, if you want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders of change, that I've been working for many years in companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
And then, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
But the word change accounts this word of change, I get a thinking that brings me - I don't know how many hours - and it begins to put into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and form an encouragement, hunt.
Kaching, in fact, is a presa, is a bit of achievement that, in my opinion, clearly, this prosecutive of all personal personnel, a leader today of willing to know, that is to know how to stay, to know how to drive, but to be present and to lead the change, to the cake is an enemy, and it is a creative of transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new element is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, meaning in Germany, brains.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then, the prosthesis, the change of perspectives I make a project, I've paid on the project, but what transformation I've got, and in this way there's a transformation that can be transformed into me, it's not what I've thought, but, to take this leap, to do things, to gain roles that will move through this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've imagined it, then, through five fundamental purposes, the first one would know about transformation, that is that everyone is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of works, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can integrate your creativity, simple, stormine, we have started with a tunnel, brainstorming, it's one of the tourists that allows you to fulfill your creativity, what you do with the divergent and convergent thinking, but this is not enough.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve that emotional part, that which is the fear of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first, here, to achieve the absence of being emotions and emotions, those forces, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And what's interesting is that doing this isn't that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, not that you stay different to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a change of rule, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, consciousness of both emotions makes you do this.
I'm not so much the idea of managing, but also of nourishing transformational voices, because the real difficulty today is to support the leader to identify that with their behaviors they can generate something that has a concrete impact on the inside of organic groups, what does it mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the contesto where people can relate to each other, but they can also help each other trade, and that's not that simple in the organizational networks, because there's always the evaluation of the results, as if the results were all accumulated in just one way.
But on the other hand, dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, it also offers the opportunity to do that, to explore new ways.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow up with an imaginary spirit that is a child to imagine something and, in the end, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Do I get involved in collecting creative spirit?
It's here.
And, of course, the impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact that necessarily reminds you of whether this organization doesn't require to reinvent the very customer relationship, because the prosective is completely changed, then to return to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change its paradigm, meaning what, so the sense of attention we've seen in the video is like saying: the guide is the volcano for the development of creative thinking, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way we look at people, I can find something that is not so discussed.
Then, the courage, on the one hand, to make physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all, to create a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
But to do things happen before you and then outside, so in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to land, to lift the confidence belt.
But how many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
which is the chance to see from the top the most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcasting human being.
The city.
And it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible that millions of people, for thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They can live not all separated, but together.
But in what we call cities.
But are you ready for the forehead?
An important question, but it's positive or negative all that, but it would be better to enhance this phenomenon or limit it.
And this is a story that has gone back in time, in fact, this is Manchester, in 1845, was the biggest city.
It's more populous from the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money, and in fact, in this city started.
What I call the longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
(Laughter) And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were living in Manchester, and they didn't see what today captivates you when you spend your weekend in New York or in Parigi.
Imagine: they saw strade, without leaves, without poverty.
The question, but not that of today, the true smoke that was indeed.
Because carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And obviously both scratches with the book, of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon possible was like saying a malignant suffering, something necessary, sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
There are also tools to limit this phenomenon which is clearly the cause of all the problems of the world: Sciences, urbanism that you see here.
Something tremendous, that maybe you've ever met, that has bizzy tools, one is called highly the service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a mud at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then the pianification, the piano, meaning the idea that there is someone from thealto, who can imagine the future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or is it still for the reason why, fortunately, you have never met?
All of us, who can even say and pretend to imagine in a centimeter of the city, what should happen in the future here in a house.
It has a feffice, a theater.
And then, let's imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about cities: a famous movie, a series of movies in the 80s traveled to New York, from Los Angeles, where Manhattan.
It became an uncontrollable slide, and maybe, for those who watched the movie, you remember, a city full of violence and gold, so much to abandon it, and maybe for those who saw the movie, become a jail where all the world's catals are launched into the high and breeding for forever.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all the processes, maybe even for us a little lungh, from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
"Yeah!"
If I'm a scientist in science, this sentence, it's a total solution sentence.
But not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
It is known that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
This is the solution to all the greatest questions related to human beings: demography?
Inquination, environmental sustainability, confidence, economic development, job creation, the ability to create knowledge.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
The fundamental elements that motivate this ability, which is the city, you can see what myallels, my photo made from the ups of my city.
And tradition is creativity, that is, the fact that there are not only many things in a small place: this is a white nightcraft where thousands of people, for one afternoon, have a carpet, a househouse, food, and gather together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Here's my idea, that the city as a solution is actually a mechanism, the city's definition is no longer.
The vastness, the people, are all encouraged to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the product PIB, no, the city, a mechanism.
The city works and solves the greatest questions of humanity because it's like a black scat.
A huge mechanism that transforms, different interests.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
It is thanks to regions that have different goals, regions that have in Italy too big, that the definition of the city is no longer a static definition, the city can also lose its status, now we know some cities, in Italy, what?
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Others may be negative, maybe you may consider that, right now, we have to move on mechanisms of the human phenomenon, but that try to feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example is Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city, of the satellite, and some of them were evident, not all of them, but a green group that was unknown in the center of the city, ten minutes per meter, from humans.
That was my idea together.
[A.DE.]
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
And to nominate this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city as the largest urban stage in the world, 72 km of green, that each day can walk, as I did.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps can be imagined as an element of diversity and strength, believing in the positive things of the systems we live in.
Don't let us go.
Sure, we say...
To fight.
TB: It's the topic of INPS.
The academic law is still invoking, before the lack of solution, of cities like natives.
From then to land, he cement.
But I don't know if you all have these spots in mind.
The second example is now that.
It has a few billion km of the harp.
Because I have worked, it's called "Bon Aires."
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do from this city in 2030 with all of the adventures: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
Well, from all over the nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, has been in some way uncertained.
Violence, poverty, also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation what was it?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
Sparing the bass, with the same ability to believe.
Well, in the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies: three strategies.
The development accelerates, and here you have here behind.
A shell of intensity, which means a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure and the creation of...
Picks, pedestals, or glasses, you can see this.
It's density.
Piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build.
Stituting rooms more basically with more dense rooms.
Changing ...
QD: The population not only of the agency but from all over the world is creative to get together.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
Affering allows us to increasingly believe in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned, social spaces.
Please!
Diver and pedonals.
And this one, TG together.
Then they were applied to the development of Buenos Aires, with science?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all the world, then when ...
Ancorates a time.
Keep choosing the spot on the spotlight, you will look at thealto, this great invention of humanity.
Why is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe?
You would be proud to live in what I call, the section of cities.
[A.DE.]
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
They give way to our thinking: the words of our language are extraordinary, they are heard that they are full of stories of vibrations, of emotion, are waves.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you.
I'll talk about it in a mountain way.
My school in the yanglesis, the provincial and motivated many times dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But it took a bit longer and I'll start to show you some Latin monks.
There are many mouths on their insign and the world's greatest universities, and they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are in a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, in Sve despertar, in the UK, in Oxford.
Chicago, the United States, Harvard, says you see in your insecurity, not just university, but also proudly.
They will say, in Latin, "Only rounds have a Latin motto."
Parigi has a Latin motto, Canada has a Latin motto.
The 15land in Australia has a Latin motto, but not only: the American marine says: "Sempen finennium, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, because if there is a monke place to the world where a Latin motto could be.
What about this?
Exclusion: cooling.
The active.
"Yes."
Have you seen that?
And what is the recent marriage, touristic in the city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality, and that?
It doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, Miandyu," "Wow, Mendyu," what is this subscription of ugly blows, there is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each of us, what are the five details?
And one is asked.
Napel?
Because when we look at all the tourist patients in all the cities of the world, there is no one who leaves the point to settle their names.
For you to move from anywhere.
It's just a dogma.
(Laughter) "But then, did you have your feet?"
Let's give you a totally twistical knock.
(Applause) A round of applause from the Ministry of Benicuto: "Great, that's it!
(Laughter) Not really beautiful to see, Beautiful.
But let's use English Italians in a way for the whole of us.
Well, I don't like us, I don't even like nonsense, which is the thing.
It's curious, that's it.
G.G.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposed to "Roomyangyu" - I'm in a lot of Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents, in this country.
(Laughter) The fourth most studied language in the world, neither studies have the Italian to do things: studio or because they love it, for the kitchen, for fashion, for the operation.
For art, for history, for Dante.
They don't study it for that.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
The second stammatic.
And he said, "Why?"
Let's see, for example.
G: The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map, selling hamburgers or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And she says, "Pizza, why did we here in Italy have guided us?"
(Laughter)
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
So, there's a story to promote, in the weekend of Italian wine, of Colombian wine.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Happy and plantations that sell food and wine.
Do they say that?
(Laughter)
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence: let's drop food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
Well, that's what works the Italian magician in this way.
The "Luccorri Frendley," more "blem," directly from the passes of the flow Winter.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
And he said, "Mom, I ask you who told me."
A disorder.
Give it occult.
I ran as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon.
(Laughter)
It's like they are in our job.
And the women we see in our mental birthrates, why do you run?
But you see, there are no colors.
(Laughter) Let's talk about publicity, old, aderting, anyway, this one.
And the publicity publicity via a vecture of us in Spain and talks in Spanish: this is a publicity campaign of breveting medals in France, French, this is the same payment in Italy and English talks, there are two, only Italian words: the first one.
What's happening to us if the union perfectly?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call us, theinians, this: UNYOS.
Riuniosi.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalian, isn't it?
We are not safe.
Here's the curious thing, because, for two reasons, an Italian out of two doesn't like an English word.
60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we can see it.
And who?
We have to wait for the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled with the sign, who has compiled this model of the formula, to be superior, linguistic competition.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are orto-vincial.
We use a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
(Laughter) Not deeply, it's said in the text of the Italian language, she has purely access and subtle.
CR: We said colors, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I heard them say, "The bucket is the "lockering" that we chose for the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
AC: In the ufficies we can feel, we have to schedule a set of toothpaste lines joining the caste for "Satisfaction."
With business it's united.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this track on the customer service, because then the unite business is always a guy, white and journalist.
The Dyteglese of Mai talked not only in companies, but also in average the public administration public, the government, we have a law from the State called Jobset, and I promise you that Jobset isn't the most sympathetic approach.
(Laughter) And I forced the newspapers in Giobatt, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
(Laughter) In English, we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
And a couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To make activist awareness about this problem: free and without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of communication skills and trade, and a little bit of energy.
What's your appetitions?
who invented public records, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian, and the first group at the Cusca Academy, because, as a result, became the protagonist of this idea of sensibilization: we were expecting a disabled, but not what happened, in less than a month, they filmed, performing their name, with Dizzo's men, and in the same way, 70,000 people.
They have signed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spike that the engineer has signed up professional suppliers and have called pensioners, they signed Italian people in the west saying, "What does our language do?"
C: From Singapore, from Jedu Jalem, from Peduda, South Africa and North Africa.
(Laughter) One thing with movement: I spent hours in Canada, Canada, looking at these signs that grew up and reading the motivations.
And we could make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a dober, we are in the soap opera, if we think abundantly, we'll talk about another etangoscodetically, working in a public recording, support.
"Film, because I've studied Classic Alice, "Goda the work with economists."
Later in fashion, I've received a prize of answer, it's not for the index of the trend, I don't think it's going to happen.
(Laughter) An Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Swiss.
AR: And we know how to dress for AND.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Cchung, go Rome's food."
So I started to let me talk about our language decence, because I'd never like to say you are diagnosed and funnels that split from occasions.
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
The film because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
But the movie, because I've heard of it, the universities that say displegated, instead, that they visualize.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And now that somebody would finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old, thanks for engines.
That's it.
CR: I said, an extraordinary ecosystem transversing because in mass communication they established this thing between 0 and the year amplified.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the Pop on the Republic Republic Republic, which is considered a large applause, a section of Italy and the sale.
He spoke about Wired, and Vaniti Faire talked about, he spoke about Christian family, he spoke about the dancing of Turing, he spoke about today that the behind him made a publishment: azensity.
Why?
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in interactions, it also touched me to put myself in the city, and on the beach of the Etigi, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lady.
That's it.
We need that.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
And we have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, it's a factor of more emotional, we need to sell the spiral, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
(Laughter) In English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten, and so the one who talks about how he manages, spoke better.
And then, that goal has been challenged.
FdB: In the first of the talks of this play?
The championships that defined himself "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he'd scratch the volcano, in Italian, it's always the structure, the way to decline the Italian language, helps us express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
(Laughter) We resign to express one of those feature.
One of its successes.
From the great potentialness of our specifically Italian creativity, which has radicized in its mapping language, and even if our linguistic view is used, we can approach some term strange.
But we need to enhance it within a thesis which is not fulfilling and enhanced by losing sense of what is required to an excess, of endings and detrimental.
But why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, in Italian.
With our identities, our radicies, our history, our openness to the world, that passes from our words, thank you.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
And when does a guy look bad?
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
G: But if that person, even to something that doesn't go, is your mom, or your grandma?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
And I started to look bad if still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young girl, the young man, like everyone went to school, I ran and fought with my friends, but what's behind these photos that you don't see?
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
(Laughter) To the beginning, if I asked you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother to the center, to my adulthood that I'm currently passing through my teenager who you see without record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called "S health Problem," and when a parent hits, and you're still a child, a teenager, they're your reference points, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they feel vorty, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
It's the difficulty to focus.
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But, along with this, I could really manage your emergencies for which no one has prepared you, how to manage the situation while your father or your mother saw many things that are not psychologists.
Or to have to do with alternating in a gold and depressive way, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, setting up, the treatments of suicide.
But in addition to all this, we also had to keep going all the time, going to school, studying, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another character, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your good mother, a physical health problem, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and designed in automatic way, or if there's even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mummy, mum, something that doesn't work, the answer of the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a ring to understanding what happens inside you and your love, a ritary to ask and receive access, many times, not to receive a cure, and to you that if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside you and it was family, stigma, prejudice, sword, can lead you to having everything inside you and not say at all, but loneliness, in silence, I'm a heavy person to bring to a board, but at the same time, I felt distant from them, because it made me grow up before the others.
At the same time, there was also a result of help, a result of help that couldn't allow us to go out, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
And when the first grade started to open, at that time, when, for the first time, light started to filter, remember again the psychologist of the family council, which is the first person missing out of the family, where I could learn, and that helped me, the piano is individual, and even the search for me.
Later on the Internet on forms, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that had brought me to the trips.
Well, the stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has collected me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
And you know why it happens, because of our children's stories there is no one who has lived the same things we've lived on us, but it's statistically impossible, in the world we're millions of people, and yet we've tried to see it, that there's no other who've lived the same things we've lived on us.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that natural reactions to what I've experienced, but I've also been able to see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I traveled my first intercontinental path by myself, and I traveled to see in Canada, to meet these children, to talk to them, and it was a moment of positive or powerful spirit, because their view, the pain, but also the ability to react, to transform the pain together for someone I spoke about, but also my own.
This encounter has been an enormous owner, which still gives me energy, and it's an owner that I've strongly visited in Italy and Europe to help other empty features, other children forgotten to be able to pick up their heaves from their homes.
The wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel just when one in the business starts to suffer from a psychiatric disorder, it's an immune desire that needs the help of all of them on my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2010 that they don't have a voice, to start the first Italian association, created by children for other children, to give voice to children guided to all consultors and sedentary centers of Italy, because no child left alone, and also their mental disorder, and even these kids must think, I was one of them for a period.
And initially, when I thought about this project, I was detailed: I will never make it realised, how will it do?
But on the piano, I asked the people around me, also to the scursionists, who proposed to tell the story during a year in ten minutes the story, and to find these people in the civil society who perhaps hadn't experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in the change, and the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
And the other huge desire we're realizing is that of meeting schools, talking to the students, not only the schools, but all of them, to be part of the actors, to be front of those that are positive and negative emotions, the leaves of life, being disconnected, even if it's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
It's that one of the characteristics that wasn't opened for us, let's enter their desire, and also thanks to you, is the will to change the scope, and that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream fully, also thanks to you.
Today I want to talk about a special person: Aaron Sfarz.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and it's easier, but to make a list for as much technological projects he has collaborated with for about ten decades and an intellectual, up to ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something related to something called reddit, becomes a millionaire from one day to another, continues to do what has always done to build an open and collaborative Internet, which is one of the protagonists of the archae, and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, because it would go to Buduto, enormously, the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 years ago, the history of computer education revolved around March's capital at 16 years old.
Aaron told her brother in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn prestigiously: she told her mother that, at some point, she was carrying out, and a Aaron was two and a half years old, hanging in the segelon and hanging her on the fridge she had just attacked with her head.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at Aaron's projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information, HIV's Internet preserve memory, at RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, that allows blogs to synchronize, creativity, so they make access to people of content, creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information, that we just need to think of a second at anywhere, we are in schools, libraries, universities.
Power information also talked about Mility, also about Montessori, which means giving access to information to people means making a democratic act, our democracia democracy, based on giving access to education education, without this, there is no dismiss.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
Aaron came to this genius which he is, this came from his cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker, not as a hut, not as a hut.
When you know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reading the world a better place requires access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this with it: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become a monopolic act, but you become a building act.
[A.DE.]
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in this thing called Open HACS, a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many great editorials have the keys of power making scars what scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
Inès: Wrong.
QD: You're passionate about this, scratch this thing called Open Hux, Guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy; the first steps was power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
There was scholarships, AFBI had accepted it, not a hacker of this genius, it probably wasn't observed.
It means that your opportunity to make Aaron an example, you want to give a small example to show all hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a set of rules.
That's how the aromine is made of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats and could do it, but not in this scenario, and they've been answered informal Pharmacy attempts, up to 35 years.
But it spends millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And it was equipped with the most novel that she saw a terrorist: two years later, her first arrest, an air conditioner arrived at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
And one thing we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, some similar, people who wanted to access information, on the contrary, I would like to share with you now a minute from the last week of arnospharies, a few months before dying.
S: I think it's a soccer pole, because... (Laughter) Do you know how you do it?
Now we need all the tickets to get out.
S: You know that she talks about a teacher, so we are very fortunate.
"Yeah, no!
You have seen a bit of prosecutive: E39 is Streetland, Streetland, Streetland, Streetland, Streetland, Spotlight, E39 is a more important thing.
Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese, Inglese...
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two edible polarizers of the Internet, it's a mass spionage platform that is used to spy, to check, to oppress, and there's another prospective: the Internet is fantastic, liberated, is extremely complex, because the Internet will always be, this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
But I didn't share my fears because I don't have them, but with the words of someone braver, and to make living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what is already here, the hell that we live in every day, that we are working together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore, the second risky requires attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make it last and give it space.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everyone, then in 1950.
I was eating with some physical colleagues in the area of the lab of Losalamos and improvedly with the eyes of theattoo and asking where all of them are.
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians: he was overwhelmed, no, he had a reason.
Well, then, if life appeared on another planet around one of these very ancient stars, so much earlier that on Earth, you could appear, in galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, and maybe you'd already traveled between the stars, there are more people from our Sun, most of them are the oldest of our Sun, which are all how many, we are alone.
So, this is possible: Charles Darwin explained that this is a question that we've asked all of us, how many, before or after, in life, I least do it as always, when I was a child, I was looking for a stunned sky, and I asked myself if at those bright bright bright lines that could be the living beings, that perhaps at that moment, they were waiting for the hope that there is life outside the Earth, it would be an epocentric change for understanding, for understanding, and also from the place, as well as in the other places we see in the other places.
But to bring it back.
We could do better, but also the light that is certainly in the sea in a sea of space, and so, in the right future, we could do better, in the right future, we could do better, in a right future, because, surely, in a sea in a sea of spacies, in an open speed, I spends more than four years, to understand the things that are seemed to us of planets of pianets, to make us think that there are more, for example, more than four years, that there are no longer real opportunities, there are actually a reality, that in reality, there is a reality, in reality, there is a reality, that there is, in reality, there is a reality, that, in reality, in reality, there is a reality.
And I use an example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand's pairing and the tip of my hand hits, and the transcending time between the formation of our planet and Earth and today, four billion cells, the animals.
The dinosaurs appeared the dinosaurs, and so this gives us the idea that this long history, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, it was a long path, it was a difficult path, that was accepted by unbelievable events, and that, therefore, I should not bring the origin of the most complex organisms, I should not bring back to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an ugly: we could hide the road completely with a Lima's harp.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
If one day, as I wish, we found out that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms, the first extraterrestrial ones that could be a simple battery, the pregnancy could be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be rare, and even their existence can be significant, incurable, compared to the times of the universe. Perhaps they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they reach a certain level of technological progress, to self-manage, or simply get involved with the audience, they spark, without leaving any stage, saying something.
And life had to overcome a large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we thought about ourselves, our species, far away, imagine us coming from the universe, no one would ever be accounted that we've been.
And we are alone, we are a very young species, maybe one day life on another planet to confront and overcome the problems that we'll find in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover the possibility of helping scientific knowledge and technology to reach the highest possible, and we'll be harder.
And then I believe that even more we have the obligation to keep access until we get to this.
In schools, wonderful, full of consciousness, sorry for example, in a small planet that was lost in the spring of the cosmos.
KP: The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport made of Vitoria.
(Laughter) Not from the sport that those who arrived before, classifies, but from the fact that sports creates positive and positive things for others, and as you may think, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like running, and here I was in Namibia, during the first cover of an extremely hard trip, a trip made of 104 kilometers that later became 100 to 6, or even joined two, because 150 were too few.
This is a long story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 km with all the participants, that instead of running, instead of being worried about the arrival of the first, we came together after the 100 Chilean agonies.
And the journey is the first difficulty.
After the first days, we were terrified in Windock, which is high inside the map, and after six hours of traveling, it's enough.
But the difficulties we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a night cover, a cover of 15 Chileans, so it's very simple, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
But we do them during our attitudes.
But the desert is in general, the race is a bit like the metaphor of life, no, you begin to do things.
Later, the unexpected things happen in life, and even in the crop, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a garage, whether it's time to do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the chance.
AD: You react.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
Thank you all.
Miabe 3!
Thank you very much.
C: That's it.
S: Yes.
Good afternoon.
For example, I couldn't make a mistake, because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, it's true that running at 61 grades, I didn't know the fortune of the existence, during the marathon of 42 kilometers that we have, but, unfortunately, there are many many many, many of them, who, in this moment, are evil, before losing a cover that was in a desert.
And the desert started and taught me so much, he taught me that we often are to be.
And we also feel during all our ideas.
Build, during all our work activities, our inhabitable, we feel inhabitable, we feel.
But many, unfortunately, in the desert you realize that you are a punch, maybe where you walk around you and I run around 15, 20 kilometers where there was nothing.
And when you travel 15, 20 km, where there's nothing around you, you realize how small we are, and you also inspect that beautiful things of life.
They are not just cellulare, or the ultimate fashion, absolutely many youths to be happy must have a cellulare, no, at the last night.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at some point in the desert a night we went to eat and stood.
It depends on the pulmine, there was scens.
In this desert, it's going to take a wake from a backpack, it's the door to this warning and it tells us, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this wake."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, teach.
And I don't know if you know that with warning, now we don't need to be happy, not only for warning, it's good to be happy with many other things, but it's important to sometimes valuate how fortunate we are.
The anamibian desert is the desert I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there is the highest doll in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when you're here, we have made of strings or almost, you can see it there on the side the gallerine that is spread on the other hand, it's as if it touches the sky, because in the desert it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist.
So, when you know it at the top, it's an amazing thing.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, only five Chileans were left.
We are already the Chilean, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and what I did now.
[A.DE.]
He scusates it, Maringan, (Gringan) 4 km/h, the tridouette venture.
C: For me there, daddy.
(Laughter) "Why am I walking full, am I happy?"
[Inglese] Thanks to everyone that I'm losing my strength, (Laughter) Chiao brings me, brown, I'm no longer there anymore.
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when the city, in this morning, talked about the small principle of my well-being, and I found so many people with me who had shared other 26 people, because it was a motorbike garage.
With many contents: 96, there were only 86 people who had a degree with me, in the end, the last 2 km could also not do them, because the challenge was 104.
Throughout history, and at the end, a magic, an amazing magic.
Then, you can see, they were all very humiliated during the score, because the winds were a bit rigid.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician seas, you can go backwards, do the other Chilean, you can go back toward.
To get to 1006.
But why is the project?
The goal was to say, to reach these childs' bells, it's really inside, in the number you, always, important and recurrent, the interesting thing that we've arrived at the end?
And the funded recipe?
The money drop was over and achieved its goal: on December 20th, 2016 that if you take the figures, they are exactly the numbers that make 116 km, or 116 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
But I wasn't very sports.
I was smoking, when I had other caps, to bring people back together.
I was surely facing 100 meters and already made a big deal, right?
I wasn't alone.
Look, ahhh!
Besides having a wife that is enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who is already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
(Laughter) And Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years difference, this is the first day of school, and nothing, Riccardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first elementary school, so big, so big, I don't know why Riccardo was a Police in her Pietro, I don't have life.
[A.DE.]
It's a bit like the race, what I've just mentioned before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating epidemic, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this celebrating hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malform that we didn't know during birth.
It has endured hardly, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
(Laughter)
When it seemed like everything was right, February 18th.
But in 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too crazy, okay.
So I said, "Oh!
G.G: The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Surely not me.
B.G: There's no.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
Wow!
But in these moments?
But you don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) Continuing?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Continuing to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And in Riccardo, keep moving forward in life and give the chance to the other two that arrived: Emma, has never arrived on January 29th in San Pietra.
And eventually Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there are them, we had to be positive, and I couldn't do what can manage to create or improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people the strength, right?
I reached the desert of Namibia, where these 160 Chileans are completely in auto-sufficience, so I'll only get the water, we come, and we hope to get to the end, but the desert is different, but the metaphere is always the medal, which is to be able to pick up 2200 euro to help children and help them get better.
It's all the difficulties we can have, big or small as there are, there's always an expectation for everyone, to do a lot of things and to move forward.
Because life is a bit like we have a bottle, right?
And today we are here.
And today it's 17/6 of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to all of you.
