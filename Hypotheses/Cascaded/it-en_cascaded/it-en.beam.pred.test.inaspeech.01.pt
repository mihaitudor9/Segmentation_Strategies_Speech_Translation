(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently so far away: Be, you must know that, until some time, my two largest children, Mars and French, in order to sleep, they chose two words.
Then, the story begins with the little kid, Riciolino, I'm convinced, now this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't, and so the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon, but intrappolated from a terrible incarent.
The words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune.
There was a little town called Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man to try the potatoes he wrote, the potatoes were too big, and he didn't think about it: graders of the psychocenic, he picked up the microphone and said, "Salva todos, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the internet that my first words as I was born are web, web, and there was this way people would laugh."
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
What is this a man?
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So one of my family would have interrocted me and would have said, "Yes, man, we've understood that you are."
(Laughter) And then you won't forget that, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, so I'd say mom, but the strength makes you, but I'll tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, my debilities.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What's a moment, I talk about my flexibility and they take away the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
It's then!
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
But, how did it work?
I worked with people, all the people I met, who became part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me: finding a disability, you can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
Trisomy.
None.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They are the words of that little glass.
I was failed.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) the doctor, and subsequent, sign, perhaps he has not understood, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
(Laughter) Then I, at the point of qualma, cow, misery, we don't even know what we managed to do the NELA mask, but the rhythm, the dotted we gave the alarm to the doctor, because... (Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause) We keep moving much about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, after a few months.
(Applause) And even the most beautiful thing that have traveled to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've become all the best people, the best of them, the best of their work, and all the people who, somehow, find each other, and if this is not the potential.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are very informed from the technological point of view of disability, particularly from Dan Syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, analysis, we know everything, but very few, very few of these people have had meetings with people.
Hondisability: and then, to put together a bit of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone news" and "Second Anna," where so, without predicting too much serious, but exactly for nothing, ancient say.
(Laughter) Or another, where she says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know from one, how they went to school," and then we set up this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you cause an illness of Down syndrome, and you don't give birth eyes to dark, because we believe that the words also have their importance, and also because we talk about Down syndrome.
Have you made a small X?
(Laughter) (Applause) Because you, today, to meet TED, talk to people, you've made a little bit of fatal, here's the invitation to make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your lives as persons, but also people around you, a very small advertisement.
In this path, we can lose because our tendency is always the one to give us a step forward.
A blow clock under: Here, in order to wake up the eyes you have to put yourself at the same level, and in this sense, it captures me a lot of times of losing, that is why I like a politician to leave sailnesses, through my stories, and well, I also did this afternoon with this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to try to trace disability.
In your life.
To clarify it.
And most importantly.
Remember?
That's it.
What can you look at the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who lives or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And I understood that my mission in the world was actually not born for a bunch of bees, nor for a romantic disorder, as they told us about some speakers before, but for an orchestra, it went well, it could go further, because it was my mission in the world, it would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable, just leaving food.
But why food?
food?
And not only, so, it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact, because our food choices of each day are usually a large part of our daily environmental impact, if we want to translate it with an indice, we could talk about ecological pressure.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, saying that almost more one word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the life of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
Another thing of consumers also is to optimize consumers, and especially the way in which we compose the bact every day, theattoo, so, what are we, effectively, bringing it to the cake?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the support of the thread, of the rejects, of what we usually use via, and here in front you have a small example of scary, so the less noble part is around 50% of the raw materials, but it can't see all these parts as a group.
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
With this implicity, I made chips, but I could also cost that naturally, make us a cake: the bus.
Magarius I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria, I'm sure you're more, the torso is focused on it, and I'll close it and appreciate something that we all have at home, and that we usually don't give up on a look and we go on a way.
In particular, ants, but all the food, to sprease less and appreciate it to the maximum: optimizing is also optimizing the consumption of energy heat, for example, every time I use an electronic electrodom like the vast, but you can simply use the vast coast, and all the time you've bought, like it is.
A very practical example: take a glass like this, it must be hermetic, let us, for example, a new, covered with the water and youth, and compete it in the middle of the golden plates: when we were in war, okay, there was a lot of food pressure, we had a lot of patates, of pollution.
And truly, when the canvas are put, for example, cards, fish, it's certainly something that we can improve, if, furthermore, these proteins are animal proteins that surely have an environmental impact, eating so many vegetables, in reality we coexist a large part of our protein hydrogen that serves us, because, in reality, it's really too frightening.
To also say, ridicule, can decrease its environmental impact, and above all try to eat them as quality and as possible, as privileged, put a few fewer proteins in theattoo, that maybe try to convince all of you to rely on the products around the house, and probably for the society, and also a benefit of public goodness for the society, I think it would be important that all of us will be less protected in the environmental investment.
Those of you may be wondering, well, in the next year, HECPO will also be HECPO, and there's a protein food which is absolutely zero, but here it's a representation, because I like the lights, that have a little suffering from bones to vegetables, maybe not the ones with me on stage of people who talk about the future.
I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, we had more light food products, around 35 years ago a law that prevented us from recycling them. We were also so many to dare, extremely versatile, an extremely delicate taste, just knowing how to do, to save your lunchons, a small painter, a gold, a little bit of land, a retina, to avoid it.
Simple, but I'm a very optimistic and Bourghignon, the French seats or richer a stranger, so unite of me became revolutionary, and twice in the year you would have your rooted in a spring, like an ortagger, ask you a time to cover around an hour, and then you can do what you wanted, so from the year.
I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six gangs, you fell from one to the other: the other has gone with ten gangs, if I give it any value from one to ten to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you'll launch the side of ten gangs, come to this game, add an equal or largest number of mine.
So, six to five different experiences you've experienced the play, to win with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
I'll explain to you: I can launch data repeatly and capture data from every victory, a possible approach based on the experience, after 100 lights I'll realize that coming to the Mount 7 or 8 times every play, after 100 lights, I'll realize that vicinale to 75%.
(Laughter) With the increase of releases, my stomach based on the media of the succession becomes more precise: this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of the big numbers.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the resolution of a mathematical problem, called Monte Carlo, for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematician: a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo in an elegant way as we would be abused of the brutal force of computing.
(Laughter) To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago, I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Music) Now let's put the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
The environment of work in Uorica is exceptional, my performance, a supercomputer, to semine the conferences are in the ordinary of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence, and humanity, unbeatable, is revealed after the first week of a doctorate.
But the PhD doesn't do it for everyone: often frustrating, after all, based on innovative research, behind every surgery, there are 1010 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time alone on my computer or on a statistical background.
(Laughter) In order to confront these shocks it would be a very lonely passion that I wasn't proved to.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
(Laughter) In a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how you think you can teach Maths and English, for the first 40 minutes I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending, all that I needed, and why?
I didn't want to answer this question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I opened my degree, I started to live as a lesson in education, and I wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to be a solitary preparation, I had to compassionate my students, to take them, to make them more advanced, I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
Preparing with the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
(Laughter) I really like to correct the contents, read the readers, the right mistakes they are, brings a continuous learning, and then there's the moment of their performance in class, become a showman.
And in my heart, in my heart, the lesson is my spettacol.
It was the attempts of the students who paid for my whole life, and I was learning from them as much as they were learning from me during the third year, and there was also a specific recognition, the University of Warrick gave me the reward for eccellence in pregnancy, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my doctorate, I had so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way, I was experiencing something that works in large scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
At that point, I went back to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, you remember, why is the reason of all this euphoria, that floor, and the extent of determination?
(Laughter) The answer I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
This is the culture of sharing.
(Laughter) There are objects, benches without any astrology, that give birth to more people, instead of reserving them to almost scorvating.
There's a concert.
Behind, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, a passion, a talent, the happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind was sitting in motion, at the moment I had tried to put in motion the lies of my students.
(Laughter) In Inghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my doctoral thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step in which mathematics and communication will meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
I've told you this captain of my story itself because I think that what I've learned is shared, met Monte Calla parte, but we'll be watching, but we'll be watching, but we'll be able to see, but also passion, as a catalyst of our talents and the culture of sharing.
Is there an ultimate thing I want to share with you, and to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a preparation for the graduation exam: there are more than 100 students in the classroom, a young girl in the front line asks me if I can give some instructions on women's questions, there's already silence, I didn't see her, but I spent the Saturday night to witness the friends of the five years passed, I picked everything that can expect in a scholarship, I entered a good one.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare: it's true, we've had a little time in practice, but there's a lot of subject in the Internet, and wherever he has been written on the rear of the diagram.
But I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
And I scratch to the washing machine, but often an animal to ask them how to procedure, they are well prepared, I go to the cavity, and every point in practice we need a theory element, that we put together, someone asks a very difficult question, but I did a show on their tattoo book to make them take the breath.
It's a saying, come on, I invite you to get to the magnifying glass for the exam, a group of students get close, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
A final student approaches me: the solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
And finally ...
It was too courageous, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
And I have a huge smile and a bigger heart, and I think that maybe I'm just in the classroom to your place in this world.
So, this is what I want to say to you: mind and heart are worthy, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside your belly, your mind is core in movement, thank you.
It was a physically starting on November 2th, 2003, during December 26, there was a "Selfie," and shared it, #30, #Movender, asking for our love to donate the global movement, finishing the research on cancer of the prostate, in more than 29 million dollar treatments, and they start to grow up the bathrooms for our world.
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
CR: In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book.
It's like often a captain, while I read and while doing something, started to make me some of the others, started to listen to different conversations, there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It's a central topic: Samatina my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, when everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
And you feel your diversity, or your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know itself to practice, and the opportunity appears right now, instead of diversity, which is how to integrate?
All that has brought a different look, remember one day my daughter: Carola.
It's a mom home, we have a family of friends, girls, so at some point the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Of course, we are really three men," and says, "No, they both love each other!"
And then this diversity, in fact, is exactly the right thing.
To do something different.
(Laughter) I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and this is the difficulty a little, but because if, on one hand, I want to create a culture of change, on the other, I need to create change leaders, that I've been working for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
Then, when I'm driving this birds, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States, writing in a paper, the word change, adding to this word change, I start a thinking that gives me in these words and forms a hatred of cake.
(Applause)
Katch!
Because in reality it's a belief: it's a bit of achievement that, to me, clearly, this is a prosecutive of personal whole, a leader today must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change; to cake is an act, it's a creative, of transformation and change.
Well, what's the new setting here, at least for me, at least the new ones?
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, in management.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
And then, the prosecutive is the change of prospective that ...
And in this being there is a transformation that has also transformed you, who are also involved, who is not that I'm a project, I'm paid on the project, but which is the transformation that has, and in this way, there is a transformation from one side to another, to be, and all that I do, thanks to the transformation of this transformation.
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've already imagined it through five.
Filater fundamentals: the first one would know about transforming, transforming means...
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of the workshops, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's, by turning the environment in which you are.
(Laughter) And if that is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can integrate your creativity, simple, stormine, we have started with a tunnel, brainstorming, and this is one of the tips that allows you to fulfill your creativity, what you do with the divergent and convergent thinking.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve that emotional part, the fear of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first, here are those forces, those that make you feel a mistake, but also those that make you feel the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that to do this.
It's not that you remain indifferent to the contents, and to say what they've done, that they've made these messages, for only to suffer in Italian fields, certainly deserve global immension, just for innovation and it's growing up to 67 inches, now we can mention the number of examples of rule, no, but you can enter a transformation that is personal.
Men transformations have to do with, like saying, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is precisely to work to create people's responsibilities.
Luckily, we say in management, create the climate, but I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader to identify that with their behaviors they can generate ...
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can interact with each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not always the same amount of organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were achieved only in one way, on the other, but to lead the opportunity to do that, to explore new discoveries.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
Well, there's a simple competition here, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, better than I say it, better than I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins, and what's interesting when we get to this situation is: "How am I doing?"
It allows me to collect creative spirit.
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, and it necessarily remains if you don't have an organization, you can also reinvent the very customer relationship, because the prosthesis is completely changed, then to get back to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
So the sense of attention we have seen in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking, but this assumes clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but especially that of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
And then out, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
(Applause) We are about to land.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance to see from above.
The most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
of the man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, actually this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it doesn't exist, and in fact, in this city.
I understand what we call.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They used to be strade, without leaves, without poverty.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
It was called "the conviction."
Out of the city's operating classes.
When the city accused, of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty, all the bad guys in the world.
And there was no other way.
What limiting this phenomenon was possible to say?
S: A bad suffering.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
There are also tools to limit this phenomenon which is clearly the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendousness that, maybe, some of you have heard about, those with bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years: only him is on his forehead, or even in the last year, the Zonization that fortunately you've never heard of all, but who has even managed to say?
And to imagine in a centimeter of the city, what should happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot against the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And being thrown, so much for abandoning it, and maybe because you've seen the movie, you remember, it becomes a prison where all the world's rivers are launched by the high and can be launched for you.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all the processes, maybe even for us, a little lungh, from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
"Yeah!"
If I'm a scientist in science, this sentence, it's a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
It is known that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution.
All the big questions related to the human being.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
The security is the economic development, the work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Congratulations.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The mentors that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, you can see myallel, my photo made from the upset of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks and others who also ignore the name of the most famous calling.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare where billions of people, for one afternoon, have a carpet, a midday at home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Here's my idea: the city, in the end, suffers, and somehow addressed as a solution.
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The vastness, the people, are all used to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solve.
The greatest questions of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, with such individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Why?
Maybe right now?
After thousands of years of history, these abilities are temporary suspected.
Waltri, perhaps!
Please, may you ever consider that in this moment or in some periods?
Remember how to be.
This virtuous mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
I find tools for human containment, mechanisms and tools that develop development, and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the past few years.
And that they are not afraid.
And it's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
You can feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast!
Autopia and courage, the first example.
It's from Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From that satellite.
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
Who among us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving towards the city.
The idea is...
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbital stage that each day can walk, like made, and what?
For example, when you see the city maps, you can imagine as an element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
The first sentence of solution, cities like nurses.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have this in mind.
The second example is now that.
in a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do from this city in 2030 with all of the adventures: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, has been in some way uncertained.
Violence, poverty also derived from a higher national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
Limitate development, and it's now courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
The ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do development accelerate?
And that you can see here, behind, an intensity priest, that is, a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician:
The creation of pedonal spaces or glasses, you can see this friendship.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build.
Situiting.
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency, but from all over the world is creative to get together.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
And he too.
I mean, that allow us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
Are you spacious?
Diver and pedonals.
And this tragedy brought together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
We know that the cities...
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Stop.
And Makaki.
Sitting the location on the belt, barefoot from thealto.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe?
Are you very proud?
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
(Laughter) The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
It has never been our thoughts.
The loss of our language.
They're extraordinary, they're evocating that they're full of stories of vibrations, of emotion, they're on note.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And you see beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about it.
In English, the provincial mixing and motivated many times dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But the penetration was a bit like the larvae.
And I'll start to show you.
Some negative twists.
They have many Latins on their insecutions and the largest universities in the world, and they show them with a big budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia.
In Syria, in the leg united to the Kins College of Ronda, in the unite Oxford paper.
In Cicago, in the United States.
Hardad says "three" in his insurance.
Not just universities.
Happyly.
Dichiarian, if it's in Latin, eh?
Honda has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
Kinsland, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: the American Marina says, "Semper finelli, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even an education there's no point to be seen as NASA."
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
On the other hand, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality?
And this: it does not even understand how we should say, "Room, me and you, Wow, Mendyu," what is this amp of Blça Lega, this contamination, this quote of the circuit between two lights that gives sense to each one, what are the five stalks high?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
But why, but because at the moment that I take, if we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there's no one who takes the insane thing to settle their name, to land.
It's no part of it.
Just Doma.
"Dad, then there's his job."
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
(Laughter) An Apparently from the Ministry of Benecuto, "Veribello," that's it, (Laughter) It's not very nice to see, Beautiful, with the English Italian, in a way of all, it doesn't like names, the curious thing is this.
Mah.
Two Italian speakers, but we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about the Italian, the most romantic language in the opposite of "Roomy and you."
Stoized in Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents, what you mean.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, don't do anything.
Yet ...
That's it.
For example: pizza?
He achieved the world, continuing to call us.
Pizza.
(Laughter) Here you see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map that sell to bug or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Why do we here in Italy drink wine?
Keat here: we eat food, we drink wai in Luca, there's nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote in the week of Italian wine, I say, "OK" (Laughter) Why don't the Resistors of New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
That's it.
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
This is what is written by the Italian River's paper: the "friendly" scene, the most "blem," directly by the passes of the "fowinter."
(Laughter) And OK, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones once, but explain why I should call one ...
Don't think about it as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
How are we for our benedies?
And the women we see in our childhood rituals.
Why?
It runs.
But you can see, there are no colors.
We're going to talk about publicity, old, of marriage, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and French talks.
This is the same hall in Italy and it's English: there are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if it perfectly disappeared?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go to our radicies, let's call us theandini, this, "I'm on the Only."
Riuniosis, the radicies of the same Catitalian?
[A.DE.]
We're segmented, here's the curious thing, because more than two Italians don't like an English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say, this is not 58 so we don't know English, we don't know how a country, and we can see it.
(Laughter) And here we have to wait that the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled the sign that has compiled this model of the is beyond the linguistic competition, and yet every day, for drugs and prediction, for conformism, because it seems model, because we are very vincious.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The clockery is the "lockering" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
(Laughter) We say compilation competition, we say "casting" from "big ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must create a set of lines joining the caste for satisfaction (Laughter) with the united business.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because the unit is always like that, flat and genital.
(Laughter) In English, they already talk about it not only in companies, but also in average, public recording, the government.
(Laughter) We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't make it much better.
And I forced the pictures of Giobatt's thesis, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea, I was in detail that I had to do something, communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To make mining sensibility about this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
It's a bit of energy, this appetition?
It invites me.
Public public records, the government, the companies, the media, say it in Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for us.
A speech of disappearance, but not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting names, cognitions, addressing, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spy that the engineer has signed up splendit professionals and called pensioners, they signed Italian people in the west saying, "What does our language do?"
From Singapore, from Jerusalem, from Peduda, South Africa, Canada, Canada, Australia, it's something with movement: I've spent hours!
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
And we could make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a doer, we are in the novel of fuel, if we think abundantly, we talk about other tangoscodetically, working in a public recording, support.
Filure, because I studied Aliceo Classic, but I work with economists, "I live fashion has received a paycheck, and it's not a price for the trends, I don't think it's after," and we know that we're talking.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, go Fast Rome."
(Laughter) First of all, I started missing out about our language, because I would never like to say that I would never feel diagnosed and funnels that split from time to time.
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We sign because I don't believe those who say "cool" or "cool".
(Laughter) But why did I have recognized teachers and universities that say disappointed, instead of visualizing, "I'm filming, why don't I know the workshop?"
(Laughter) First of all, I want to understand what politicians say that ask my vote.
And then, when someone finally brings this initiative, I'm 85 years old, thanks for engines, here, here, as I said, an extraordinary approach to transverse, because in mass media, this thing was done at a zero cost, on the Internet.
The year amplified.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the storm of the Republica, but it was taken with great applause, also, in Italy and Turkey security.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
He hasn't spoken about Christian family, he has spoken today that behind a drag, a transversality.
That's it!
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of riachrums related to the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional people, and I also had to put myself in the city, and I was interested in an Australian radio, a lion.
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate but the Indiana helps us understand and it's a fact of democracia, because it makes us understand a fact of democracia.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, it's a factor of more emotional, we need to sell the spiral, bring it to the world, because it represents us, and know more lingue, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, on top of all, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks like mangia, speaks better.
And then, this duty is lit.
In the first of the talks of this journal, Leonardo would define himself: "Here without lying."
Because he was scratching in flat, in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign and express one of our pecuriarities.
From its flessuosity.
The magnificent thing?
Potentiality.
Our specifically Italian creativity, which is the ten in your mother language.
What's more, if our linguistic thesis is strong, commonly, we can approach some strange techniques, why personality?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
From lack of sex to excess.
Finally, they are not bad at it.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
(Laughter) When a face starts to look bad, the attention is to the person about their needs, but if that person, even to something that isn't your mom or your dad, what happens?
What happens to you, if mom or dad or dad, started to feel bad if a kid or a teenager still had the hardest idea of being a young age, like everyone was going to school, I'd be picked up with friends, but what's behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the dead part of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back and reclaim...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love the channels, and I've changed my hair straight away: at some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then crossing it, but what is there to be invisible in those photos?
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, love, hatred that are strongly altered, fear, rage, sadness, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
And the difficulty to focus?
And also the need to look at each other in addition, like using sponsorship or addressing flowers, are the nicer lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy, but in addition to this, or being a victim of bullism, perhaps because of behaviors that no one has prepared to do it.
But how do we add all this?
So I had to continue, to make my life always, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another goal, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or Tovaban, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and destined to be automated to ereditate the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your mother have a shepherd disorder, a disorder bipolish a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mummy, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Nowadays, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect, and for you that, if your children, affection becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the neglect, can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What was behind those photos that wasn't visible, behind that smile, there was a crown that came to be automatically formed, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to be afraid, rab and cave, and to prevent me from getting the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing the things of all my guetans.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade started on the Internet forum, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that my parents gave me, but it's statistically impossible in the world, we are millions of people, and yet we were able to experience it, that there is no other thing, who saw the same things that we saw, the same things that we saw on us, but the right and the right thing, and the right thing that this person had to filter, to me, to be the first person, to filter.
But through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017, with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association, created by children for other children, what was incontrol was an immense owner, who didn't recognize me, but seeing the reflection in them, finally, in the containental, alone, for the first conference I suffered from a psychic disorder.
And it's a project that has come out of low, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of you are here in this room now, who have grown up in this same desire, gave us the challenge to start, for parents' children, with a mental disorder.
At first, when I thought about this project, during a trip in ten minutes the story, and to find so many people in the civil society who perhaps hadn't experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in change, and bring a soup of the needle in two or part of us, to the school library, with the students, to move the institutions to do more in mental health, but everyone.
You can have a marriage of atoms to face those that are positive and negative emotions, the face of your life, leaving markets, before you are too bad.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
One of the characteristics is that bottle that wasn't open for us, let's enter their desire, and also thanks to you, it's the will to change the scope, and that's why I know that the young person will make her dream fully, thanks to you.
[Yes!]
Today I want to talk to you about a special person: Aaron Sfarz, when they have dedicated him a documentary last year, last year, 2014 the online-boy anniversary, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and it's easier but it's to make a list for the technical of projects he has collaborated with, ten years ago, and an intellectual until ten years ago.
(Laughter) So in 15 years, we built the creative people, who were responsible for the technical part: today, the creator Commons are around a collection of content, of free permitences, make the most flexible and open copyright, for example, Wikipedia's license.
A few years later, a small start-up started building something that co-founds something called reddit, becomes millionary from one day to another; but, honestly, they didn't turn off so much money and fame, they still do what they've always done to build an open and collaborative library, with digital memory archives.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high school law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do monopoly, to go to play-out, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What in ARON absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronna tells it himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 years old, all the tasks of economy, political theory, the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
(Audience) Yes.
Aaron and this told him about his fridge, in a very touched moment of the documentary that you had to see, and he had learned how to learn how to learn highly: he tells his mother that, at some point, she was sponsoring, and a Aaron was only two and a half years old, he was seduced in that fridge and showed her the avenue on the fridge that she had just attacked with her kids to calm.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creative Commons are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental point for banality, which means that power information, power information, power information that we just need to think a second at anywhere, we are in schools in libraries, in university, that is to give access to information to people, meaning, to compare a democratic level.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this ...
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
(Applause)
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
[A.DE.]
That's it.
Circa, in 2011, was interested in this thing called Open HX, a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
making the keys of power making scarce what scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
People said to me, "There were...
It's interested in this subject, scratch this thing called Open Hux, Guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy; the first ones were power information.
[A.DE.]
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
And AFBAI had taken care of it.
It's not an act of this genius, it's probably not been observed: it understands that your opportunity to do with Aaron, an accident.
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
(Audience) Yes.
Yeah!
It's an aromine made already of a veracity and its traditional farming persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from traveling to the academic fish and it could do it, but it couldn't do it, but not in this scenario, and they've been answered informal Pyramatic atts, up to 35 years, it spends millions of details in this legal cause.
And it comes equipped with more nim than seeing a terrorist.
Two years later, her first army, anon stood at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people wanted to access information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: I think it's a person ... (Laughter) Ah, now I ask you to do what is there.
But even now everyone, she has arrived.
S: You know you're talking about a teacher, (Laughter) Ah, I ask you to do whatever you want.
- And no!
Attention is a little more important for prospective: Streetland is Streetland, Streetland, Spanish, E39 is the Art of Stone Street for Cracking Challenge.
And then, what can we do?
- Yes.
The line was drowned in dust to the corn, and it was the mourning.
So, how do you do it?
Look: these means are a monk of a damaged winter.
You're basically!
And so, after the last years, this is the first time I love football, it's not a scansion.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass spionerform is used to spy, to check, for or first: there is another perspective: the Internet, fantastic, liberated, a full space, freedom of expression; in fact, these things are equal, in the same way, the Internet is too complex, to be just a single thing.
What can we do?
Aron says something important: Zaptuas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing, and I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make it last and give it space.
Good afternoon everyone, well, in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly, I had a look at theattoo.
It's duty.
There were all how many, and he didn't talk about other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
He was boiled, no, he had made some reason about some other planet around one of these very ancient stars, so much earlier.
That on Earth, we could appear in an intelligent species wing, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, than we do, maybe we'd be already traveling between the stars.
But, we've never been informed about none of these intelligent civilizations, and here's the question of hierarchy, I said, "Who are all how many, it's something that can generate some curiosity to extract and, effectively over the years, many approaches were tried to answer this question, to these very fantastic proposals, but the most simple thing is that there is no one outside, that we are alone.
So, this is possible: I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a hooded sky.
I asked myself if, around those bright bright lights, could be planets, planets of living beings, that perhaps in that moment were waiting for my vocation, they are asking the same question, we are alone in the universe.
Our species has also been learned with all the other species of the planet, and we actually come here, we all descend from a paragonable unit, maybe even better, to the other two.
This is one of the biggest in astrophysics of the last 20 years, 20 years ago we would be able to suspect it, that there were other planes, we could understand many things, to understand, for example, if they have an atmosphere, so to understand if, in the future, there are not too far away, and in this light that there are, in these pianetian planets, that we couldn't be.
And the answer is: don't prepare Alige, no, because they're incredibly far away from us, they're separated from us inhabitants, I hope that all of us can be plenty of kilometers in the second, so a huge speed, but I'm saying, how much this space probe is to reach the closest to our lives in this moment of gender, because I believe it would be an epocentric change for all of us.
It's a longer time than any citizen civil society has already existed on our planet, we could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the fast speed is accepted in nature.
But surely we are seeming isolated, we are expected in a sea of space, and then there is one of the things to be present when it tries to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that.
And then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, evolution and only here.
On the left hand, there is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complex made of a life of billions of cells, animals, activities, dinosaurs appear here at the end of the palm of the left hand.
(Laughter)
In the beginning of the last speech, a natural catastrophic event, very likely, during this long history of life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet are bound, stressed.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history on Earth's journey was a long journey, difficult, accidentated, governed by unbelievable events, and that so I didn't have to bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, and not that I should bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens, which is, we, all of this, in all of this, where we are.
Very well.
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence can be very significant, incurable, compared to the state of the universe.
The great cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a little bit of advertising, maybe we are saying something, life had to overcome it.
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine us coming from another planet, if we spark ourselves.
Besides, probably in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
We are a very young species: just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate on radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived at the residents of the solar system, but we really ended up putting the footprint in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounds us?
And I think that we're going to really be a fool here, and we, throughout the dinosaurs, have, as I believe, and I hope to help scientific knowledge and technology to confront the problems that we need to face, to guarantee a long future, in which the othertelle will continue.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key of these galaxic intelligences is to survive as long as possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep access to the end of achieving this wonderful chain of consciousness, for example, in a small planet lost in the window of the world, thanks to it.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before classifies, but from the done sport and that generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that is likely...
Then, just believe it, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 Chileans, which later became 100, I joined two, because there's our little bit, no, and I include two, because I know a number that will come back in more moment, this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
The journey is the difficulties already started in the first days: we were terrified in Windok, which is the highest, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough difficult, we arrived in my desert, the oldest desert in the world, the beautiful desert, a desert with characteristics that are particularly responsible for which I chose this type of garment.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first cover on the first cover, and the chord is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things; then, during life, imprevists happen; but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, it's always the opportunity to react; and I'm the first difficulty I had after three kilometers.
Calm down the sun!
(Sound of soccer) You want to do it for this ghost.
(Laughter) Okay, so you put me... (Laughter) I don't like it anyway!
For example, I couldn't make a mistake, because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to pick up basic resources for the control loop and a infant cancer that unfortunately unites so many children, I, before this experience, I hadn't experienced very much the existence, and when it's in the desert, because there's wisdom, which is warm.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a car on a pull, and at some point in the middle of the desert, he realizes that you're a picker, maybe where you're not just a cellulare, I've had various problems, there's no arm, or broadcast the door to this line, and I don't know if you know that with the ward, we also feel the doctors.
The anamibia desert is the desert that I chose because inside the desert of Namibia, there's the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters high, and when you're at high, it's an incredible thing: sometimes we feel good, how fortunate we are, and so when you're at high, it's an incredible thing.
We are already in Chile, which also corresponds to the dome of a corner of the world here in Namibia, and the real sky: (Sigh) They miss, in the last four kilometers, when they make them strength.
(Video) Ricardo: Pad, I love you not to understand anymore.
I, in the desert, I found, even when I was also invited this morning, when I talked about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, other than 26 people, because there was no such a girl with so many stories, 96: they were 96 and 96 people who crossed with me at the end, the last 12 millimeters could make a magic, a magic, an incredible magic.
As you can see, they were all very humble: I also had the share, because the horses were a bit rigid.
So these are us because the organization that had made a Chileometer away from the front had put the gang to give me the opportunity to come, to finish the uffician cow, then return, and go back, and do the other Chilean to go back, to reach 1006.
Why did the project have the goal of getting to these?
In a Chilean is really in the inside, in an important and recurrent number, the interesting thing is that we arrived at the end and the money drop, on December 20th, 2016, there are exactly the numbers that make 16 kilometers, or even 16 to 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
I was sometimes captained the people of smoking, and I was surely 100 meters away.
I wasn't just ... scused.
Obviously, besides having a wife that's enough, I had two children, a little bigger - Riccardo, who's already ten years - and the other Pietro, who was six years old - and nothing - Riccardo had to go to the fourth and Pietro, in first elementary, so big - I don't know why Riccardo had policies in her and in Pietro.
It's a bit like the race.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the one I mentioned earlier, in the end, the fact that sometimes you should know how to add, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this cerebral hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malformation that we didn't know, during birth, and it lasted hardly.
And...
So, when?
But when did it look?
When it seemed like everything was right, February 18th.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too crazy, OK?
G.G: The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
BB: And then ...
And of course it isn't.
KP: There's no.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments.
You don't have to let go.
And it needs me.
(Applause) Continuing to continue to dare not to convince the strongest strength, because you remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed, and Riccardo continues to move forward in life and give the chance to the other two who arrived: he arrived at Emma, and has never arrived on the 29th July in San Pietro.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there are many combinations of so many, so I started running, until I got to my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people the strength, and to be myself, stronger, and so I had to do that today is an important message.
It's all the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always there is hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
From 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everyone.
