In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Forum Fortiching Learning, which was supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born rationally.
The motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient: Let's imagine that this is...
A big university class.
So when I go into class, I usually go into class.
The first ten minutes, when the students come in and are seven.
Ietto with the ego my computer to analyze and use a classic music.
And I think this is the first step to create data environments, fewer disabled forms, and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
Well, during my lessons I use a method that is used by ananticity.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on everyone's shoes, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942.
Together.
Black Park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a young, thirty years old.
Alan Turing.
They arrived at Cambridge's school.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator of tastes.
But, older than setting on a paper.
And from those letters they get stamped other letters, according to an impoted functionally under the machine.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures to "black".
with his team.
And I built them a machine.
the one you can see.
Dietro, grado of...
Decide.
This test is written by ATDESC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine?
And we make them form the concept of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about mental magazine.
computer and machine learning.
Dove proposes your test to you.
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
Are we familiar with one more person?
Digital it and have the computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a M machine.
It's a "o" operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the Mapa's machine exceeds that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome testing.
We must interpret natural language.
The question, who comes from person?
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches.
To study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they get there.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
We've heard about Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates and mortal.
This is an active argument.
Both premises.
Feritire.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detutive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
It's close to building deductive arts.
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people?
Initiality.
(Laughter) Do you have to act?
It must be adapted to this.
You have to set goals.
And know how to bring them the terminals?
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is linked to intelligent agents.
Riforming Turing's quote, a machine can think.
Let's say, can we make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's close to building entities.
Artificialities are supported by man.
It's a cycle.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents, according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I'll explain to you with some examples.
Eight managers are the agents that benefit better than all men.
And you can't do better.
For example, agents that resolve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, think that a few years ago a child has been rising.
From the start of the Rubik cube, it was resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any months ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve the index, in 63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
that act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the camp is...
The face of scacks, shakes, landscapes, beaten by artificial people.
We have the human rights actors.
Those that exist almost like all people, for example in the Pker Texano's game.
Think about acquisition.
We looked at the "min".
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
We are talking about the fridge.
How is it?
Mela.
What are we talking about?
From the bus of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
In America it was introduced to a concept of technological singolarity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest.
Arts of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate?
Now imagine.
A red line that indicates robot intelligence.
With a sponsocial call.
This is a sad moment.
The abandonment.
I'm preparing in the wallâ€™s law.
Why?
Computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, twelve years and in quadruplicate every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I don't need it.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we could already be able to operate in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then?
In 2045 and theindic is the moment when technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
I was talking about the mental magazine.
Turing didn't just propose her test.
But it also proposes new observations against its same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
He was a student at the University of Varese.
AC: I followed a course of epistimology, of ethical psychology of computer science, so that this teacher won aanzerone high school.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the things we had to do was to propose an obectation.
According to Turing's test, against artificial intelligence, I was the only one who proposed a formulated decision with mathematical communication.
The toney is stupidity.
Afterwards, I want to describe it in simple ends: Should we take the intelligence of all people?
Tell the seed.
The symbol of the summit has the lead to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we have ...
An equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
Let's start with the first question.
I can use machines to think.
Now I'll encourage you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
But how many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
Okay.
Well, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I call the rivers, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his phone, which doesn't do absolutely for me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here to discuss.
We can consider mobile photographs a new linguistic way of influencing the aspect of view than the forms of complication: technological consciousness that exists.
In the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer.
It still does the difference compared to the simple gesture of a smart phone.
And how do photographs change the forms and theestructure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to learn a confrontation.
With photographed, rappers, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflection.
I took the photos of professionals who, for the first ten years already, opened the challenge of this new middle, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal elections, the experts, of their share experiences through the cellulare.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
at the DESC of the photo editors of New York Times Magazing, that scattered.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big community places of contemporary.
selfie, for example.
The selfie is to simply get involved in a global narcissistic disorder, or it can't be seen as some sociologists have sustained with the disturb of body dismorphism and it can even be registered, as some psychologists have sustained, with the disturb of body dismorphism, and to put ourselves in a session.
Like an identified setting.
Like a subsidiary of his imagination, as it is biased by the visa to the female artist like Keitard Ben.
Look at Sholaga.
It's the financial term which has signed and still segts both our vision of the mobile.
This is my dream, Zazzi, who is the victim of my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's academy of interactive taste.
Or, as sociologist Bornata has sustained in New Yorkenson, it can't be let to the police of more complex fators, of social, storic nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
Because it's called "I Revolution," joined in a history of mobile photographs, because in front of the floor of images we were married to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that puts individuals into communication from one angle to another of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
Let's forget because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the man there.
In a contemporary, which is still very signed by the question process.
In certainties, as brilliant as the philosopher Zygmunt Pound.
It's as a typical of modernity, architecture, work, family, coppy, are increasingly increasingly increasing, and here the drawings are unstabilized in a universe in movement, spontaneous from the average of the messages that harvest them daily.
The phenomenon of the mobile photographs seems the most natural expression way.
A liquid vision that is composed, makes you compose.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What is the only professional photographer left?
And what difference happens between Western photos and conscious photos?
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
taking part in the process of democratization of photography.
I started with the Kodak industry and it arrived until IFO.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's ending, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
Following for being.
A powerful tool to guide public operation is to capture a source of devices and information impossible to control the regions.
This is a picture of Cairo Pensichi, a show that the Folfang Museum of Ess, has dedicated the center of the photographer in the Spring.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he released the necessity of accepting a political agend, a law and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalistic priority, he has liberated it from the impossibility of reaching limited resources.
And he allows them to directly put themselves in the ranking of News, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
We offered Time magazine in 2012, with Instagram coverage and directly put it into real time through T-E-COber's performance, naming a new model of Newsmacking and I see journalism, reality in journalism.
This is the scale model that had originated after this experiment, and if it's true that in the radiation, "Pscat," we photograph the compulsively, a quantity of pictures of hell ultra better than the one we are able to remember, and the truth is that in this same time, new paths of preservation of the global memory in which they read and photography and society in Novecent.
Or you are born men.
We traveled by corporational section, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by those professional and non-normal photographs, and there is a job of scaling in accantinity, in narrative, regarding a topic.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Dengami Lowi.
Hr. VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic measures that, starting with a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Bay Strek platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
Pread Mengin, who is used by the photography of sport, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreperformant look, and made a huge traffic of intimate and minimal narration of most basic income.
Richarch Corte Ernandt, who tasted discourse and acknowledgement in the street, creating a personal beauty.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempt and partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
The Peter of Campo, who, through the Everest Everest African Count, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African African African African Systems, along with media outputs of Western matrix on the crisis and on the fame, has also proved to put in question the stereotypes of the journalist.
It's like the Luis that reinterpreted the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, storying in the IV TV series that I'm one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history with the most new vision tool.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who photographed the successive manifesters in the sink who, during the proteste of Midan, with an old puzzled bronic, and contemporary registered with his own cellulate the moment in which the capture of the Bronic bronze and is born in the image, translating this photographic experience in a pocket, between analogy and digital, a long term, and contemporary stream.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do, that we don't know how to do you?
To keep on walking down the outskirts of action, or trying to see many ideas that see many of them on top of the benches.
To learn more than to record.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contesto, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creatively the code of storytelling, designing in a different healing.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world's perspective.
And the quality of deep learning.
Anyone is the pregnant recovery tool.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a single, articulated in a puerent way.
You can distinguish yourself.
Right away from the background that is me.
That's all I believe.
It's still a difference between photography, isn't it?
It's a real image.
Her bulimic, reproducing, her self-refidence and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
Half thirds have come into the mind.
In our quickly lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
An email.
It doesn't exist.
And so, in this room, those actors.
These are the fights?
And to give you a frequency of 50 ARS, so you imagine, you shoot home after a job magazine really stressing.
You tag with your partner, with your partner, and then you will get to bed in your bedroom and think you're on your own.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
We have a positive side.
Or better, I start before the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive side.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
Great.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50 hectares is nothing more than a sounding circle, a sounding circle like a rich circle, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents?
They enjoyed when I was a child.
Well ...
I know it, you may think that this is the classic 'backyard' history, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness.
During those days, in the burden of that house, I started to play music with everything around you, so ...
Each complement of the net was no longer.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But let me become my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
But I certainly say, at some point.
I started to become a normal person, trying to say.
So I started studying yesterday.
It's the pianoforte.
I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to stop the clearing, the problem was that I liked the arbore very much, that there was a strictly ambiguous song, bringing it to the first years of studio in genius.
I also helped Clarinetto.
It's good then, to dare ...
My failures, my classmates.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to sponsor it.
to the problems of life.
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the rumor made us grow much more.
And of a smile.
So here's my mission.
Even when there are children it's like transforming a failure, a sound.
In music.
And to harmonize what it is.
It's around me.
I felt a great example of Clarino Paoli.
And all this would be conclusions, but no, my life was complicated in this way.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
What is the study?
Well, this is one of the hardest ways to understand, but also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion.
Our inner ears, the colony of bones, our team, reach the massive functional.
return to the fifth week of gestation.
Thirty weeks of gestation: this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching.
And this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
To what spetheral in life, once born, it must be ready to the sound texture.
You shouldn't be afraid.
It must be its own.
So no, in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child is once born.
- Yes.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to music choices, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else.
Okay.
(Applause) What is it, but what is sound?
The sound is this ...
It's all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
But it's the sound column every day, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, and yet, always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's much smaller than what you imagine.
In a small town, what?
Picola for the men of Mility.
The school of San Pietro.
With your house, maybe?
It captures the same as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me.
I imagined higher, well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So?
starting from this budget.
The visibility?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try!
Imagine our life, I would like to assume your ability to observe, then we are in vaccine.
We are in the sea, not in case, and we start to...
Let's take pictures of the feet, of the wisdom, then the architect, and then another prospective, and then it's photo from below, we don't do it, but we also make those, then there's the beer application, so we use a drone to take a lot of photos: "Wow, a food blog isn't true."
(Laughter)
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others: bahway!
To listen.
Fermarvi?
And to listen.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, hooing it.
Your perception?
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life.
The dream of my life, born.
What about harassment?
It's from me.
For the first time, the architect of myself.
It was 2013, I wanted to flee far from school, a series of failures, problems, and other things.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I listened to the plant, yes.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artistically, it's really far from me.
Shanghai, I decided ...
And participating in a competition, an artistic residence and the most beautiful years of my life was simply listening to me for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only growing, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of all over the world, of all the cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this Sound of City project.
And everything starts, really, from the waste of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool.
And in order to reach this musical tool you succeed in entering the city's heart.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a shap colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to swallow you.
ShanghÃ¡.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography differently, and you've become more than once, but that smoke, that comes from tombs, that's coming.
But Brooklyn bridge can resonate.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
Everything is completely in the leg.
And the desire to root for them?
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was another part.
It's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you ...
You know a bunch of posts.
In this photo ...
The helpless drop is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
(Laughter) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds gave me data of these children that in this tube.
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Then, and now that is elaborated.
This is not.
Salt, to the span of...
(Bianche) Great.
And I like a little, it seems to be part of that ...
It's so normal that I've never been, I've been attacked in this beautiful situation and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
It's a big deal.
It's in the lab.
OK, Genova is Mordandis, and it wasn't a fight, this is a serious thing.
Anyway.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Junt of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical instrument, and it helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
It's filled with the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I cry.
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become something like AP.
The door voice of the column are no.
This is the rock sound.
Mr.C.
Hello, now.
I wanted to make you feel Geneva at hand.
It took me to this point.
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
I'm sitting on our passions, in my and in your lives, and in the way people will tell you they're rumorous, stupid.
For a long time, she really wants to hear her, and I thank you for listening, thank you.
As Guy Beck says in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea has, in general, the idea of the Ristitution linked to the Monetary Ristitution to Benificial Intelligence.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And to pass from the part of those who say: it doesn't work.
Afterwards in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approached us, so the post had 18 minutes shared some aspect of this story.
But starting from the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's paper.
It has a network near Segrate.
It's in the same year, my monastic wife I organized the moneycut to pay the school.
And the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some people said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the Commune State."
Most of them faced these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
But it has taken a billion 200,000 to read, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro, then, and it was an extra effort of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similarly, the same school at the next school is active, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
There's the concept of gameback, of reproduction.
It's extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is mandatory for the whole of society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Both.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've had good fortune, I reappoint.
She likes school.
I used the university, along the museum, along the theaters, there are all the communities that can afford a voluntary restitution, not that really there is no treatment, there is a phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are alsochanisms, there is physical inequality, there are processes.
Function: a city based on this.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
To the supporters of the famous Obamaker.
He says, "That's Miss Dun, it's from Mormento."
We are already expecting a lot.
Initially, they ask, "System is one of the moment."
Obama has a famous bananasier and has been an incredible technological debt.
There are technological gangs, there are 100 million dollar gaps, so not worried about these things not only happening in Italy.
(Laughter)
This is a sound that doesn't work.
A lot of millions of content, and this is the standard response they receive.
In a nutshell, the criteria doesn't end for some days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, and it is enough to pass through the criticism that is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is extraordinary.
It's not common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Let's raise awareness of the technologies that were sent by Google, other companies, got fired, and agreed with the white house, not riachitty, laughing that you put in, functions on the site, stay in a few weeks, in a decim of the costs.
Many would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
"When?"
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting time, and that's what ...
I'd like to explain to you about what it was like, the spirit of people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible.
And make them again reproduce and scarce.
And they create a replicable system, the IUS of Torris, from this effort, it was born.
A replicable system is what we expect to do as well.
I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, which have been the ows of our lives that have inspired us and have taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, keep insisting, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
As of course, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
I wanted to do it.
Do you want to feed the world?
To be or not to do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian guitar is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Any year later, we're five to discontro-materence without Francisco, and he came to my visa, to Silicon Valley, has become sensitive to the necessity of transformation in general.
Anything has led us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of the public recording.
But he asks me: Why don't you help others for an year's pair?
We thought, I reflected, the payment with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my capo Jerpeso, to make it brief, I decided to apply a method to choose, in detail of not having any payment to find it, and I couldn't, or I also try to notice it.
The choice has been made and so it has been done by Rome for two years.
In the roof of art.
- Ah, manzone.
But those who do it, Mallia Amazon Probone, you're killed, but from something you'll get underneath, these are only many slums, I must say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on a positive side there was.
(Laughter) I would mentally ask myself about chottingism and bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But do you think this disaster of this disguise, and I did not expect, of course?"
Butoscienticism should often have cinism, that throw you a certain mentality.
You never see her, obviously, you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind.
This country, in truth, lack a lot of sense of common good.
And it's doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interesting.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner.
For the older people, you recognize it, like a high-grade commission, I say this because it's the huge title, my children gave me an immediately at the beginning of an extraordinary commission, and simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume people from the foots of the public record.
And of course, the only thing I asked you is.
It's like the systems from the inside aren't transformed, we want to try to transform them with people from outside, where the fact that we don't know the public administration.
It's an asset, not a Billiti bathroom, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so we financed a small team.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations, about 80 times, 20% hopeless to make giants, legal ones.
Doctors of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write?"
What I think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
It's also temporary.
It has a compense, probably, much better than what you see.
How can I guess you?
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other reason, maybe some of you recognize it, that blank picture of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone's children, all the United States, in this massive sport, in terms of investments and infrasion?
We created the vision.
The country's operational system, a series of fundamental components about which building the most simple, effective forms for citizens, public management and companies.
It has through innovative digital products.
The vision of beauty, the introduction, is decrime and blood.
I've continued in my postcard field in salt, but in that American future, if I don't agree.
And I continued, there will also be many rules, complicated, unimaginablevoltaic, and it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of us will say, don't understand how the public record works.
We've already tried many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
What follows?
Let's take a lot of criticisms: some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and biased.
The criteria of the first group will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and there are many treatments.
The one in the second type, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the bicycle as a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is your problem.
To teach things that don't work.
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the Times magazine cover.
This is here.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible for us to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of course, at least one hundred years, we made digital tourists for the chores, an application called Jazz, we put it in Beth in the Govern Sea, I did a math test, a terdicoli for the technological part, the team gathered the chronic mass, now we are a few of you, and he was successfully in search, what did we do?
In fact, we are dealing with idraulics.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect because it's a big problem.
Why?
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected is silos in not to connect.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machin, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their fears, their applications, so it's about introducing this, explaining it.
In years, implementing this, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
Then there are software, of course, and doing so many activities in management project.
So there are so many identical activities.
But we can't also suffer.
To make the tasks of the sink, in time, you have to make them improve authentic interface, selling more basic things.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your friends you can't do.
After a few months, during the period of 2017 we said, "The System triends the publication, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in pharmacy, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Due.
It has written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
The first time it was...
According and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole affirmed the decreto of the present as minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the formal element riches a team game to simplify amministration public, the city's life, particularly of the piano.
It has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, there are especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
What's this: this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management.
According to the recovery of the technological rules and the rules will likely to three warning wages and connecting to other norms and at some point there are quite dark and incomprehensible technological rules: unfortunately we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: the trendal piano has put its hands on the technological skills of you understand it, has put our way to do it.
Talking to administrators, making us give feedback, documentation on Ox networks, so that the administrators themselves, the technological administration of software can't.
Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano.
At the population platforms, these are the competitive platforms, they're the digital payments, they're the things that abilitate in general all the public administration public activities, and even more there will be.
Digital payment is one: digital payment is one: electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
Let's do that.
While developing technologically, all the data of your citizens that at this moment are about 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the huge database unknown.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk about the rest of the administration applications: when I come across a community to the other side.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago we made an Akaton Seria.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
In a vaga-fixing, so, putting up a software problem.
The improving documentation and even new projects.
It was done in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us, namely, a technological view, like the outside of space.
All of this?
It concludes, and we're talking about sustainability and replicaability in the beautiful territory of Italy.T, where they're wovened, all the documentation, in all the code, but more and more, of applications.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what should be, maybe even of me.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that officially...
They're not limited to do an iraulic, I enter into the ball as well as the child.
But it serves that the tablets are composed, let me disappoint this, this might be, for example.
And it's one of those things that would love.
When we'll launch Alsa version, Alfa, it's called digital citizenship.
Do you have a phone?
Smartphone has the digital identity, has data the card of electronic identity, in Nepsi.
It's functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction of citizens and public administration.
The interface is simple.
We are dreaming a little, because work will really do so much, but it has different vision of this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it.
We design a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rules and not the institution.
A country in which they read and recognize and promote the right to innovate, to prevent building it.
A country with high technological competitions is also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public administration is an wealth: where the best humans do better to work in public research centers, that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation.
The door in a development of the country.
Now I'm a dream.
And what the components to do all this process policies?
Technical data are really many and maybe many.
But if I don't have a dream about how to punish hardly, they can help me do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Beauty did it do."
[A.DE.]
And here it's been taken somewhere in this theater among others, to this point, but it's easier, and in a site I managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like the slums, like the 25 kids of digital transformation, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Anything?
And if you want information about us, our dream is our social, thanks.
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life.
That it's not going to be passed.
What would you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know it's, then raise your hand those who will change some of your body, maybe you lose some threads.
Or maybe you won in muscles?
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom, raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want, or maybe you're one of those who will change partner.
(Applause)
Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't understand if I took part, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have a more united family, but my parents were separated.
[A.DE.]
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
The lice would have smelled the most complex professors, it seemed to me all eyees and all reflected in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Before the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I had started fighting and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't affect me from what others thought of me in the great economical sides, in the interpersonal relationships, in the characteristics of my birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
And these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but since most of the cases were the only three posts of playing in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up in order to keep their lives with their issues.
Nowadays, the strategy is more broadcast.
It's lamenting.
We're lamenting a bit about it, we're sorry a little about it, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, frustrating, that I'd have done differently, we lament ourselves because there's no injustice, with many people who go to the parallel, who go to the homeless mank.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who wasn't doing anything but to get bothered, from when I started to talk, then the girls with whom he translated her, so the fact that she didn't have a job, the ultimate ship of the government that didn't help her, felt a valuable, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized her daily life.
But lamenting, for all of us, is a little the big attempt.
Because with a small effort.
We could have a great result.
To review the victim's role, which is listened, comforted, helped.
But don't worry.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
From alone or with friends, to a high voice?
What in your mind?
And you can remember one thing already happened, or one thing that maybe one day could happen.
And you can lie to your tea, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
(Laughter) But the truth is that as much as you're forced to regret it hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what's in fasting.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, is that of lamenting, assuming that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Let's go.
(Laughter) Another complicated strategy, when things are stretching, is that of imporciation, it requires our necessity.
But at the base of this mentality there is an increasing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being what surrounds us.
You don't like ducks.
But from those who are skeptical noises?
And you felt a bit dirty, but why would you never be suffering?
I took two pillars and solved it easy.
The wife breaks you?
Divority.
Even fresh, let's take a look at how many risks are at hand.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
It's too big that we can't reach it, send it to the psychologist: we're here, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, so that the world around you can encourage the perfection with your own needs.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, is.
The relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during which I'm doing another thing, that listening to what, according to the other, would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
Well, it's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in a grade.
There's no classic.
And the law, right?
"I'm the one who never asked me, if not for those."
And he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do another way to get me uncontrol, and that's how, in the end, a strong iron-looring arm that always starts with the same stream word.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old.
Instead of removing the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy they privilege.
When things are not going like wearing, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result, think about a couple of times, because you will have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's...
Fair enough that there are no, like a tool, take the forehead, put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, many times, there's the pleasure of facing the inability that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the deserve of necessary needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that the time was openly driven in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example, in words.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no.
Things that didn't follow them, I didn't learn to say no to the relationships that were looking for it, there was any social condition, and it was one of the things that would always be measured, but in this way where they were going to finish their needs, their desires, and their ambitions were always under the fear of facing conflict and the need to count how many of them were.
And the strategy that privilege, when things are not as you are, is that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of containing all of this.
I'll finish to disrupt it.
To be able to get lamented.
To integrate your needs, or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in my life, in my life, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school for which I was working on sent me to call and told me.
But no, here for her, there's no more place: if you like to keep collapse with us, you must accept a transfer.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most. Besides, I would have to go there to do a job that neither had a great deal with all that I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to regret me.
Trying to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and not even because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbeatable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, clearly about my hair, at that moment, I realized that the secret...
To change others.
It's changing yourself.
If I changed?
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
And if it was a psychologist that was really brilliant, competent, complete, united, the primary school wouldn't have sent me via.
If I had done that, what wouldn't harm me more than that.
In a few years, maybe I would have traveled to see, first again, that the immense cage.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
Why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do?
He goes to the agreement of choosing us.
And choose you.
What's the cause of things?
that they don't leave as they are.
Keep in yourself as a cause of things that don't go as far as you are.
This is our bifth.
If you haven't ever had a job at the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll never find myself alone and to help confront something much bigger: I mean, you open your doors in front of you because it defines your responsibility, the gend, you can always decide to speak a new language, if you read books, go to the courses to acquire new abilities, or consolidate those you've already had, it's the basis of the crisis, what you want to do, but if instead of you, and you think that it's perfect, that maybe there's a bank to change a journal.
Because life is the one who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
And if inside the tank, things don't go well, you think that it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It's invading a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
Then, what can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
Then things change.
But they don't change the case, but they change because you know you've changed, I used to go to the research of your needs.
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate.
to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war.
(Audience) Yes.
I know one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, national prostitute, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a standard of tatuage.
It's starting to work on me, considering the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to warn to be a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes pressure, to bring great value to their lives.
But, friends, I met a "I" marriage.
What about the problem?
Stereots, prejudices, obsession is the doctor of the mates, homicile is the doctor of the debts, but had to talk to a friend, but went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
I would have had to get lamented or not to explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
No, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to people, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of having mine.
It's the turn of...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and it's the final decision.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here by the hilly lady, I say to get along with her anxiety.
Maybe you're worth it...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm from 79 published psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best editors, in Italy, my house, and what surrounded me more than anything.
It was recognized that the bathrooms initially fled a bit strange.
So I let myself leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something in common, and in Lumbium was elected to the vice presidential and the workplace.
I had dreams.
They don't become real because.
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The story you have to have is that which you can hold and carry on, those who don't know how to build and you need to discuss, because the topic should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
What if there's something I learned from all this journey that helps me?
That's not the case.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must agree with our interaction.
For many reasons, I've been asking you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life.
It doesn't come to be treated.
What would you change?
I've talked about work, physical action, and the current countdown.
(Audience) Yes!
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, as much less proved, it's a small question that I personally was very useful, and that is based on logic that in order to produce great changes you have to concentrate on many small actions.
What's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put ...
Your life in the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You may think: Which is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do?
to put your life into the direction.
It's ambitious.
Fedetto.
"Oh, are you joking about the rubbish, what do I send?"
Or feels right now, I went with the pullman, right?
Be, ugly where do I put the packs?
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I hold my hand, I steal the leg.
In her feet, it's now to change.
When I arrived to my mother.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
with diverse and different abilities.
And percussions are so fast.
So immediate.
They take off the distances and join the battles.
We are partners.
We are part of the sets.
Seven kids, I see, I see, Laura, Paola.
It's Daniel.
I saw him growing.
Our provides were marketing.
The Friday was the day of protest, where it was entered.
Studying at the Andreoli music school.
They were picking the first bidonies.
It was together.
The first one deserves together.
Then we decided to become a split marathon.
And from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw: the first transcend, the first marriages in the class, the first satisfaction, the first ones.
Conclusion?
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Soundly?
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we stayed.
The earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
On the other hand, it was completely district.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
Io, Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo.
We tried everything.
You have terminals.
And the erlotte?
We've done it.
Luckily, we found everything.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manitis, of military purposes.
Well, inside that tunnel ...
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth shaking?
To search...
A smile?
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubophons that have become?
tools that are built and combined with ping pong roots.
The crying leaves with big markets,
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, there was always an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already there is born our first spettacol.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we stayed, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards.
We did.
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also display a moment from our land.
to breathe for a moment.
Last year after we made cracks, this marine show.
The next moment ...
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea is the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look.
The sea.
There were so many things inside this tender.
And no one of us would have ever thought it's a stone?
It could change our lives.
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
Mults are ending.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first master?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
What about the maternal backyard?
We haven't really done so many.
And they also give me the hugs, because that's exactly me.
It's the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also.
This is freshness.
The problem is there are so many possibilities and future.
That's it.
What happens when a dream?
And it becomes reality.
Now I have to go back to the sports mirrors.
They'll wait.
What is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, I'm actually born as a researcher, until I realized what has happened in the last 250 years.
250 years that have radically changed our history and that we live now.
But we talk about social innovation.
And my question is, what is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
But this is the digital photos: we all carry around, around us, a part of it, I believe so everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution, which actually includes an evolution which has been extraordinary for the last 25 years, is an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs in fact.
The internet revolution is known, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution of the internal phases of our history, and these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era.
But let's understand, then, what has happened in these 250 years, which ones flood?
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the broadcast on the Internet, we considered it an iron.
What was my studies?
I'm in some school books, but it wasn't only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we are huge debates, usually advertisers, for example, because we need the coast bike.
And the vapore mask is not only a vapore mask, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored, and it became much faster, the anticipation of carbon, and it started to change the modalities, but it didn't make it.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
We also need to wear glass motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanan invitation, it's an Italian invention, the scoppy motorcycle.
We need, for example, the automobility industry.
In reality, first, it was used in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motor that couldn't go from far away, when I was able to understand how to take off that belt and turn it into the verb and then on to that sculpture that developed the automobilical industry, which is all that was produced.
But they are not.
And in the Industrial Revolution we are still debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to another of the world that is always smaller than we knew.
But is it also what has allowed us?
And it has taught us to deposit the digs.
To submit.
And yes, because after the phone, we could try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
Let's interrupt everything.
We went on, going on the caves under the sea, the first cave to give a storic dimension was taken from artists between Mexico and artistic artists, not just two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave went there.
And we are around 1858.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
In Europe it was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
Today, there's the last stage: a time in 1873 is replaced by the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, it was lit by a store.
It's a part of our history, it's a great swimmer.
But let's move forward, we tried to get a bit longer rooms, and we arrived in 1950, the adventure has already grown and knows a certain agency, which has been a seventh.
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important events and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never happened before in the past history: the computer, the sidewalks.
The school designer who, in the beginning of the 50s, could be in a stance like this, and had marriage functions, just made the calculus quickly.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be artificial intelligence that we know.
But in these 50 years of the internet revolution happened a little more, there were research studies, and above all, there were discoveries of tubes and deaf people that brought us to develop land-based events, but they didn't know why they were not known.
It has at a certain point.
They decided to open these responses.
These rots called arpa, the Internet.
They became and began to be the World Web, which we know.
A system diffused, orchontal, non-archical, extremely captured, is able to bring information to collect information and were 25 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
And when does the power function?
It was, as I said, that was replaced by the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
And the Internet had theoca that, if little by little, we started to live theoca that we've lived now, that we're living now, that which is called "Fother on the Internet," and that, according to a phenomenon of "craction of creative education."
Because of course, it's an industrial process that tells us that what's new gradually distruits what's old, because it needs to make space, and we'll see better then.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions, but there's a story that is a little more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which we started to reflect, to accompany you.
It was 1863 when, from the scale, it wasn't the Italian yet.
Minister Minghetti, put an investment financial policy, establishes that 27th century of the judge is correct, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing inghet minds, I'm introducing something extraordinary.
But first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce good servings, that were necessary for their support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most importantly.
It has transformed the economic power of power of production.
of goods and services, in the power of producing one.
Well, the report.
But there is a second aspect.
Because it's the fridge, for us women, of course, it was a revolution that has been quite read, but that has actually been the fridge.
It's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but it's also the industrial system that allows us to keep, in a massive way, a structured way, in the soil quantity of food.
So, there's another chance, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of the daily life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
And in the breath, what did we say?
They didn't reach the computer and the Internet arrived, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, which is a element that we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
In the past 250 years we didn't have speeds as we are today, we do things very fast, we move fast the speed, the speed of the rings, the speed of our movements, the speed of our thoughts, which is not the detail of the thought, but we are very fast.
But until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900 to 2000, when we can say that the 20th century has finished, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that are significantly segmented in the passing of one another, 2001 and 2001 because there is no date.
The American economy started to slow down, and there were Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were strings to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
However, there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was no longer the warning of failure, they don't talk about it, but still there.
And I changed something.
But what has changed has changed the economical paradigm, we couldn't.
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis, which was effectively verified in 2008; it was crazy, we didn't think, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would happen.
We were certain that we didn't know how to wait, look at these images.
And this print?
Because they are affordable multinationals, in most of them, but above all, they are all the ones left after 2011.
And what did those companies do, aren't they innovated?
They were inventing something, they had never been able to build something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done, buy and sell, travel, learn.
Think about it.
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
And the second one, the second one, often denied it.
We tried to look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors, the connectivity: we are ten percentage below the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection between 50 seconds, and so it is little.
Anything already, according to human abilities, human resources, the ability to heal, to a distant being between empty competences, abilities based on what allow us to flow from formatical systems, digital systems, those advances, those that allow us to develop.
And a third fact that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, the industrialization of products and services, the digitalization sign.
The public administration system: we immediately get the field of some ambiguity, and we keep both important and most of all a good news: everyone, every five element is growing.
I am all five elements that are growing up, at a speed of growth completely athetic until two years ago, so we've been attending European countries, and this doesn't want to hear, but, collectively, we just need to look at the newspapers and see that I am.
We are growing fast, there are new buildings, new operators, new competitions, and we are building a very important and competitive topic, the use of the Internet, frankly we are truly applied seconds.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to watch with much attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the abilities and the inclusion of digital in brutal factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first motorbike?
It's what has done most of the time in the '50s and the pictures of the companies.
And glasses from being, the small printed media.
Something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't require the biggest multinationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
And you know how to do something extraordinary: "Made in Italy" has a quality, an eccellence in the production of services in the production of product.
It's quite united in their position, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, abilities inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve.
It's a safe interaction.
The market, extraordinaryly, generating ricks for all the thesis around you: a nature's heritage, for its existential nature, thanks to Dio, it's an analytical heritage, and there's an analogical heritage, we can't digitalize the croceo.
But can tourists?
Not only three cities.
USA started, and then they started again.
But the ricks of these three cities don't make the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've been able to start, but we're able to recover, including.
This heritage within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it away and make it black and bring it to tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all of our country, I believe that this is the biggest asset we can do to our Italy.
The issue I spoke about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word.
What to unify?
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, I'd like to start in a new way.
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
Hello.
Secondly, in the last ones.
15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century.
In the world, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens are increased or are diminished.
But I believe most of you would answer.
They're increased, if you go to journalists, maybe you'll add the precious act of action.
They are increased exponentially.
It's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be, too.
I've been asking myself these questions for the last years, and with only 24 hours the performance of video.
I was prepared with my colleagues for a rapportopment.
We know about inequality, from when they are data, that is sustainablely from 1960.
For the vast majority of countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve.
The abandonment of inequality in the world's citizens, as you can see, was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 80s, but in the beginning of this.
By the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated now we're at the storic mining.
In Italy?
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality in the growth.
How can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is that of saying: we've entered a complete alcohol, because we've continued to talk about years of increase of inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are myself?
We don't find it?
And ... the feeling wasn't wrong, but maybe the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Wow!
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality: what do we understand?
For inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality requires some rhythm.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And also in this case: we moved to Cambridge in 1928.
One year before the big crisis of 29: Lickens.
That Cambridge added a speech in front of me.
To a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, in that occasion, Keynes forms two professors.
The first one says.
It was a seventh, the product.
But for a while I'll be working ...
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this profile, indeed, is realized, because if you're about to engage.
The richest agricultural reforms of the economy.
Effectively, in most society, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years, as well.
Of course, twelve times, in some 15 occasions, so this profile was realised, but from this professor Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
Little by little, here, you can say, little to 100 years, it would be found with a huge quantity.
From free time that I'd have ...
Lavoring less.
She also said to her, to work all the time, and when she told her she wasn't much less, she wanted a week of 15 hours of work, or a three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
Very well.
Apparently, your second feature didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
But me ...
I'll show you that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says that we will all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We will remember much less, we will work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not made from any part, we'll listen to those flooded suces.
This is the first proof.
The curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
Tedical to work throughout your life, your life naturally working hard, meaning from 15 years later when we are ...
(Laughter) In terms of working, if we keep this career, Keynesi's teacher really achieved, because we reached the beginning of 1990% of the time of our lives to work.
And now we call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
Let's do it?
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Naturally?
If this has happened, there are reasons too.
Evvie, and if you want a banal, for example, the anguish is very tackled.
Because we die a lot after life expectancy and those who grew up from something like 27 years, from the beginning to the year 2000, there is another reason, it was very positive, and other bananas, it was also studied up to 25 and 30 years, so even young age was burned, but there is a more important reason for them.
Our quote of time?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the framework of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people.
What was it? What was it?
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
Reflect on this occasion.
It's this dramatic, dramatic series, because you can see it...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
Today, we are very low, we are around 50 scarc shoes, but from 1968 and 18 a year, the rate of occupation has always been lower than 50%.
But a range of occupation?
It includes 50 percent.
What does that mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income are more than workers.
In front of this?
Farming action: can we also have a reaction?
But it's enthusiastic and says, "But this?
Progress, beauty, is modernity.
Things are gone like this because we can allow it, but then we see if in the country that the modernity emblem, in the United States, things are gone the same way, because if this interpretation really should have happened in the United States, and then we can see the confrontation.
Good afternoon.
In Italy.
It was united.
This is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument, while we don't believe it, but it's even more impressive, and the storage number of the management rate, because here we see.
There is an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency to the rate of occupation in the United States to the monument, in our case, we have a situation.
Riduation.
at the occupation rate.
But then that?
Education is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
There are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most people live in a condition that I defined -
Dipendence in parassity, in addition, because from the way to your wisdom depends.
This can also be a family member, the State.
But would parassise, because I consumed the available income without working.
I was a friend who did the theater, when I found these results, we came to the scene and I asked him, "But...?"
And you, as you showed this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence, and you know what answered me?
With Epopopopopopopower is that excellin.
It's on the back of theppopotam and it's called buffago, some say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The buffag or the buffag on the asspot, or on the other big mammals, these murderers also live on the rinocerontes, on the buffs, Be, we have this film.
What's going to be there for a second in which you see?
These are the ones.
The animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
By paying attention to the resources that the buffler supplies, which are larvae, ze that everything that host on the golden dips, is not clearly that it's playing or infrassed by the hell.
Anyone.
This is sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
How can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society where there is a majority of pure consumers and minority of producers, how do we define a society in which?
There's this kind of uncondutive consumption, the first there I've been told, but this is the signal society.
The feminine society, like the feudal society in which there is a job that has placed in the conviction of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
What can be defined?
In a signorious society, but a society that's useless.
"Yes."
Because consumers are more than producers.
In the simple and classic sign society, we have the signs and the serves of the grey that produced for him, in the mass signals, things are a little more complicated, the signals have become so many and...
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the idea would define a damaging relationship, let's see why.
The relationship?
And it's the buff with the hypothomo and parasitism, and this is an advantage in green, but it's also dependent, because it depends on the food it's there.
The red light indicates an avenge on the backs of the Epopotam.
And from the point of view of the producers, we also had a face slope, a green slope, the field is autonomous, we don't need buffes, but it's somehow in a report of obligation, like we are, in front of the colors that live on our roles, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of tweet lips.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
That's it?
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
The question I had done by Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very asmetrical in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools of the protection of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent coherent concentration of neighbors that the tool with which we measure from inequality we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the position of the year is to be lost in the graduation, together?
This is Turchia.
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this graduator, the best situation, that of the United States in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
In the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured that efficient decent, you can see something pleasant, that inequality is the worst for the jobs in more than our families.
You would accept it.
Million euro per month, and in addition, there were around 12,000 euro per month.
In the year, and our state would have 150 billion euros to spend, as much as health and school cost, put together, more or less in Italy, but here, I conclude, there is one but.
Hi.
We have the scholarship to write in the first art of Costitution, which is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country.
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
So, we change things.
And we create the six million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a BEFA.
Thank you.
