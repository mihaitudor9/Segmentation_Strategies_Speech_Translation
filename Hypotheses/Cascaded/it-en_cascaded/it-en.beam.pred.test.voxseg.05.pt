Poorry?
And fragility.
And some of you will know what to do, these two words apparently far away.
Be, you must know that, until some time, I had my two memories.
More growing, Mars and Francesca.
And...
To fall asleep they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So the story.
But I would like to tell you this evening.
Then the story starts with the little kid: Riciolin.
Thank you.
But intrappolate?
It's terrible.
The word?
They were fat enough to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years pass, the child becomes a boy.
But it suffers a lot, a lot.
about this problem.
One of the bubbles is so much that it tries to meet psychologists and psychologists.
All brave people, brave professionals.
But nobody knows how to remove this instant.
B.G: One day, we traveled to Rome.
And so, just for pure fortune?
And she hangs up a little old man.
It wasn't called Walt Disney.
The Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
"When?"
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
How many people around you said Mother Teresa, but what a beautiful word of freedom?
And then he ...
The child thought.
And I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
And I want freedom.
Well, for my words.
Anyone.
It's still been in the years.
And the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
GB: But a good day?
And at the dawn of his country, they were celebrating a big party with a clich√© and a microphone right there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means?
For a glove.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the battles he had written, the comic fights, was too big, and he didn't think about it.
He came out free of the barbecue, took the microphone and said, "Salva todos, I'm an informatical engineer, think I'm so brave in the Internet than my first words just before were: web, web!
And that's what happened.
And people were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
And this is a child?
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
Dilo.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my family would have interrupted me and I would have said, "Yes, man, we understood that you are TED."
And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say about strength.
Then, I thought, "Yes, guys, that's a bit the problem of having Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power runs us.
But first, I have to tell you something very important: why when I spoke about my disability, my debility?
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
And, in other words, they would get the best of themselves.
What's a moment, I talk about my flexibility and they take away the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
And then?
Because I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
It worked.
Well, people, all the people I've met, and have become part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing?
It's wonderful.
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
But believe me, finding...
A disability, and can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or it is becoming a genius.
It's generating.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes.
And we go to the Padova Civil Hospital: we're called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician doctor can carry us in a beautiful storm, with a wonderful light to the neon.
Is there only one heart?
And she makes my wife walk again.
Let's open the paper and read it.
Risomia?
Good afternoon.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears?
Behind, there are the words of the little sidewalk.
Boom is angry.
A: Not to be afraid.
But my wife's father's harp.
She says, "Yes, puzzled, dotted, but our son is a mask and a female."
The dottor says that...
Then, obviously, ladies, maybe she didn't understand, trisomy 21.
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answers.
And no, as a doctor, I understood great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female.
Then the dotter is always more spathetic, close.
It's a feminine.
And then I say to myself, "Oh, but there's a misery, we don't even know when we were able to produce NELA mask, but the summ!
And the dot has given the head to the dot.
Well, we're moving a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult one.
Also our lives, because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyone.
After a few months.
It has come.
I'll introduce it to you.
(Applause) A marvelous one.
It's so beautiful!
It's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families.
Very wonderful is that it has been all the best people, it has become better to me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, somehow, find us.
Now this is not the potential.
But we noticed one thing.
What's going on?
Among the people we meet are all very informed from the technological point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by speed and analysis.
We know everything, but few?
Many of these people had encountered people.
Clothesability.
And then, to put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Second Anna".
But in this way, without asking too much seriously, but not for anything, old, dirty.
We pick up the news that bring: for example, a little while ago Francesca came home and said, "Do you know you're wearing like a party at school?"
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, how are you fired?"
Believe this one, and you'll be here, so this part of coal?
Or another one, where it says, "But is it true that you suffer from Down syndrome and don't give birth to blue eyes?"
Believe this one, it's said "commony of ideas."
Because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in more.
I don't know.
I'll give you an example: do you present TED?
A small X announcement started.
No, why am I showing you this example?
And you?
Why do you, today, for us?
To confess TED, talk to people, you made a little bit of fatal.
So the invitation is ...
You're a little fatal, and don't avoid the disabled encounters you'll have in your life.
Whether it's personal, it's also people around you.
It's a very recompassionate scale, but.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on or a bathroom.
Well, to wake up the eyes you have to put them at the same level.
And in this sense, it captivates me many times of losing: that's why I like a politician to leave bricks along my stories.
Well, I also did this sera with this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to try to trace disability.
It's in your life to enroll them.
And most importantly.
And do you remember?
Because I pause them.
that they can look at the face, they can feel brave.
Thank you.
And I thought that in order to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like the masoce, whoever lives.
Gandhi?
And then a night, actually, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And I understood what my mission was in the world.
In fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds or a romantic disorder, as some relatives have arcoded before, but for an orchestra.
So I went along well, I could go further, because it was thanks to a sorrow, so I remember very fortunate.
And maybe many of you have already captured, while you had an internship, to realize how scary each day.
KA: This is the scarcity percentage, it's what happened to me at night, thanks to a traffic, and this has opened my mind, it has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment I decided that what I had done, what would be my mission in the world.
Wouldn't there be nothing left to be ignored?
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
And food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's the reason we can decide, for us, for our family, every single day.
And not only that, so it's a question of choosing, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices daily produce a large part of our daily environmental impact, if we want to translate it with an index, or how we move to the city.
And that's why I believe it's important to be, if not another perfectly conscious, of the choices they make.
Every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
Ideas!
We have to optimize.
I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied.
Every day's life, especially what's our inhale with food.
To optimize means, for example, the way we use sponsors.
Then, how much we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
And then, obviously.
Trying to use 100% of the subjects.
It's also about consumers, optimizing consumers, and especially the way in which we create the behavior every day.
So, the challenge, what effect?
But let's go to the table.
Lili scares, I'm part of this project, so, through the encounter with affection.
I propose the end of the file, the rejects, the ones we usually use before, and here in front of you have a small example.
I look at the first nobilities: we're used to doing what I'm doing now every day at home, when we pull the vegetables.
And to separate from one part, there is the noble part that we use and on the one hand, there is the scary.
So I fear the less noble part.
It's in average to about 50% winter, and up to 70 percent, because many vegetables have more protected parts.
So what optimizing in the kitchen means to simply recover those things from rejects, means changing food, that means using 100% of the raw materials, but that's not mean having a different approach.
and to see all these parts as together.
And let's give an example with her house.
I can see her with me.
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup.
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also say it naturally, make us an athlete.
And buccity.
Magarius I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria, it probably costs more, the treasure, the focus, and I'll put it to every ingredient moment, another example, one of the ants that can make us more time to breastfeed.
To love 100%, for example, zenco.
And here I really like it because the bus is the veracity of nobility, it's where the fiber's maggiorequence concentrates.
It's less than the dust, because perhaps if you don't like the dust too much, you can concentrate on the buses and it's also the part that contains more fibers, so a benefit surely for health.
But not only: with all internal behaviors I can prepare a cell, the seeds can cut them off or simply make them manage.
To manage something I think is a practical example.
It's a very easy technology, but it allows us to transform, also to value.
Something we all have at home is that we usually don't stop looking at and traveling, so we optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that, changing our mentality a little and seeing.
With a different eye.
particularly the ants, but all the food.
To sprease less and appreciate the maximum, optimize is also optimizing consumers of energy heater, for example.
And many times here, there is too much or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, water there are other things.
To make verdors, it's enough to have a box, isn't it good for you to know what?
Yet?
Sometimes I use an electronic device like lavatovicles.
And to use it to care, and it's not just a cause.
I'm sure some of you are going to be born?
But it's a very small kitchen technique, low temperature, so it doesn't happen that you buy a professional tool for 2,000 euros.
But you can simply use the washing machine all the time you wash the ants.
How do you do it?
Well, a very practical example: take a glass like this, it must be hermetic.
For example, let's take a new copper with the water and youth it well, and put it in half the golden broad, the wave warning must not be filled, full of hatisports like always.
And then you enjoy the reading you prefer, you choose based on the mirror of theatti and not vice versa.
And when it finds, your egg will be to the kitchen, to the sidewalk, to the handwalk you've chosen.
And it will be fantastic because it will be racist at a low temperature, so much better than the classic or the left side, an amazing consistence.
And have you done it at zero level, at this zero?
And, more than obtaining a result that would hardly obtain with traditional technology, so optimizing the use of the electronic scale, I think could give beneficial interests: another application of optimizing this time to the inact, I enter even more into your home, when we were in war, okay.
There was a lot of food.
And we had few proteins, they would eat a lot of potatoes, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the table on, for example, the carts, the protective jokes, it was a party, and it worked like that.
Now, the problem is the opposite: we have so much abbondance and we all have a bit of tendency.
Let's put the doppy of proteins that help us, because it's a problem, because if we eat swords or offshots, yes, maybe we may put on our weight.
But if we put the protein ratio, we are actually waiting for rivers, featured, and also increasing the risk of developing some patologies, and so it's something that ...
We don't do that, so the classic portion of the resistant, but also that we make ourselves in our hands, that can be from our legs, our hearts, and our fish.
In fact, it's too much overwhelming and eating so many vegetables, in fact we take a lot of our performance.
of daily proteins: Why did I add this to my talk?
Changing more than what we are using is our sponsors, our resources.
It's certainly something we could improve if more proteins are proteins of animals that have surely.
It's an environmental impact.
It's also important to say, to be ridiculated, to decrease its environmental impact, so I think it's important that all of us would be less protected in theattoo.
It would sufficiently like a small effort to be part of all of you to have a highly environmental benefit.
It's about our health, but also of the kings of all of our country, even more if we did it at the world level.
Also in public spirits for health.
A benefit of being the singer is obviously for society.
I think it's more efficient to try to convince you, to put a few fewer proteins in theattoo, that maybe try to convince all of you to drop off the products at home, maybe you'll convince one.
Maybe that's what?
And I hope that you'll be ready, don't worry about eating enough, but not eating too much, that's the problem of proteins.
Trying to eat them as quality.
And more possible, regarding animal products that have a low environmental impact.
What are you asking?
FdB: Well.
In other words, next year, there will be Expo, and there are a lot of people talking about food in the future.
It can come from the future, I sense so much about insects.
Personally, I think I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me.
We are not just a comic country of insects and I think we'll hardly become it.
But there is also a protein food, which also has an absolutely zero impact.
What can we do to make ourselves more self-productive at home?
And what more can we nourish?
Separte vegetables, maybe not the ones that will carry on to the sidewalks, maybe we can't use it: what am I talking about?
I'm talking about surprise ospits that are with me on the stage today.
That of rumors.
Because they have suffered the first arrangements of the Trentin, as you can see.
They decided to go to letargo at night.
I have a representation here because I like the lights, I mean, because any of us can self-produce them?
I'm a winning product.
It's a part of the Italian tradition.
And here in the room, who among you has never eaten the lights?
And who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, it had more food consumers of the atomacco: about 35 years ago a law has prevented us from collecting it.
And we were also rooting the shower.
But only to be appropriated by professionals - this promoted a great development of light producers in Italy, and we are one of the countries.
And there is precisely what the economy has at the global level: there are thousands of producers in Italy, not only for food use, but also because they are used, then for the cosmos and for other users.
But it's a food that also ask chef friends.
It has really much to dare, extremely versatile.
It's an extremely delicate taste, you just need to know what to do: to alleviate your lungs at home, there's a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of land.
a queen, to avoid them escaping.
Well, the things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to get rid of the animal, or you can take uova, and then nourish them with plant drops, so even more, to knock the chests.
Two times a year, you will have your recipe in your own spring, like an internship, the French sewches or ricks more of a stranger, surely can have satisfaction.
And there's a meat, among the other slightly low fat, that has a lot of benefits.
And that can, in my opinion, not only the food of the future, but also the food of the present, I hope that the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room, that eat them and not that they'd never eat them, that surely they need a small sustainable mentality change, I'm sure you can be at the door of any of you.
And that really riches a small change, of course.
A change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices: they are conscious that they ask you to carry out the vast coast, to eat all the waste, start to compensate the glasses that is not just one thing.
It's so simple, but I'm a very optimistic person, so I really hope to see if there's no other trouble, less protein in the act, change the way we see all the ingredients and the benefits are really many, are for our health, for our well-being.
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
You know how to fly from one to the other.
The other one.
But he went to ten gangs.
If I launch it, any value from one to ten has the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play.
And you launched the side of ten gangs.
And I can do it.
Through this game, you get a number: equal.
The greatest of mine.
six to five.
Happings have come to play.
To win with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
But you must say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
One possible approach is based on the experience.
I spy.
But I can completely release data and take the data of every victory.
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
With a bit of peace starts and thousands of snacks.
But I understood that the victory proved was around 75%.
And with the remote increase, my stomach based on the media of the succession.
Then you become more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
And then ...
Well, if you had a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portable must deliver to launch the incidents?
100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method.
We can stimulate a bunch of data.
But also...
The behavior of a fluid.
Or the evolution of a colony of a epidemic.
Or even the abandonment of interests stunning together.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
I find it quite a way of magic.
And why is that?
Four years ago I began my PhD in the middle of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, which I was so streamed, was disappointed after the first week of doctoring.
Money of work at exceptional levels.
I have my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the end of the day, and the two professors that follow me are intelligence, competition and humanity, unstoppable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technical, often frustrating, and also based on innovative research.
As for every ITAincent, there are 10, 130 failed attempts.
And the dot can be a lonely path.
I spend most of my time sitting on a computer or on a statistical article.
What can we do?
The shitting rooms would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't proved to.
That's it.
Meet in motion seem to be a subject that serves a bunch of gold for a mathematician that studies the Poca.
But I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
It was so smart, you think, to teach Maths and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
With that first lesson.
He scolded a hole inside his hand.
De determination, motivation, ending.
Everything that I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't care to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I kicked out my boss.
She began to live in lesson.
And it wasn't enough to be, I didn't have enough money preparation, I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, surprise them.
and make them fun.
But I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
I got a diploma in didors with university, and I began to teach two hours to the students of the first year to more than eight years old in births of the most advanced things.
The more workplace was, the more I became efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Or preparing the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
In plays, for example, collapse.
To read the lessons to the students, the right mistakes they are, provides a continuous learning.
It's a poet.
There's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a show.
And in each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
The gratitude of the studios paid entirely all my bill.
And I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition.
Well, the University of Warrick taught me the award for acceptance in education, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my PhD, I got so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
It was all so natural, beautiful, approaching.
But in my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
What's the point?
I have to face everything that had happened in such a short time.
To answer that question, the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is this whole bird's reason?
It's strong, that burning, that explosion of determination.
The place I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that are sparked between more people, instead of evaluating that value.
Is there a concert?
Stad, at this event.
Or a stone, a book, a trip?
Or an experience, an operation, a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits?
And if you even know it.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind?
And it will be the first moment that I wanted to put in movement the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months.
And that's when I decided to take my next step.
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great.
But the university is not the only place where mathematics and communication meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
We won't be seen.
But I've told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
A method of motorcycle, for example, that of intrapening a path that doesn't come back to what we saw, or find finality in motivation through the street that we didn't expect.
And then, of course, passion as catalizer of our talents.
And the culture of sharing.
There's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams.
There are more than 100 students in the classroom.
But I come in a good eye, I divide and catheter.
A: Yes.
We're really in microphone, my three colorful penales were scared.
Have you ever seen herself?
I switch my voice, it's already silent.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it allows us to pass by.
Everyone scavenged from the class.
A young girl in the front row.
She asks me if I can give some of the questions of design.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to witnessed the friends of five years old, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have instructions.
Another guy, a few seconds ago, asks me where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had little time to practice.
But there's a lot of subject in the Internet, and you can find it, I wrote it on the rear of the web.
I'm satisfied, OK.
And I started to do it.
I scratch to the food, but many times I used to ask how to procedure, every point of practicing we rich a element of theory that we repeat the stages together.
Anyone makes a very difficult question.
But I've had the gift of their story book.
I'm well prepared, I run it.
I start with them to make them take the breath: it's a saying, fly, I bring them up to the glass for the exam.
A group of students breath.
But someone asks for evidence, but most of them only reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
I've got money.
But he teaches him to speak, it seems harmful, he's looking for the words in the past.
Alright.
Take the courage, just to tell me.
But I just want to thank you.
Why what do you do for us?
They don't do it.
I stay only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think.
What if it were?
This is exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
This is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are wet.
And that's why, when the mind is in motion, the heart beats within the country.
(Laughter) I'm a mind runs.
So, at AMOVENBR, we held the research, we put BASF, we did a selfie and shared with our love to donate the global movement of amateur #MASTATRE, Movender, Movender, the Movender, financed as well as research on cancer of the prostate, in more than 29 million dollar, and they start to do it for the development.
Good afternoon everyone.
And today I want to tell you how a voter has changed my vision about leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
And that's how a bit of freshness came into a bar, I wrote a book.
And as often the captain, when I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me out of others, started to listen to different conversations.
And then there was in front of me a coppy.
Because he was talking about change, he said to her, "We don't have to change your attitude, you should do this, in other words, change.
It was a central theme: Samatina, my colleagues.
And they presented it in a very clear way.
Now, what's interesting about change is that, as we've already told you about the boundaries.
AC: We all face change as if it were the most normal thing.
They tell us that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approached the change, the first thing you did is beyond fear.
your diversity.
Listen to your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of which has more intelligences.
And you're there to mix and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
It feels like it doesn't.
This concept of change, which is the most normal thing, actually doesn't get used to wear, right?
And the opportunity seems to be given here, instead of diversity, that is, how to integrate.
Everything that has brought a different background, remembering my daughter one day.
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so at some point the girl says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Clo, we are really three men," and says, "No, no, you are both of them, you are with mom!"
I guarantee you this: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you never know what to answer a child, especially if you were small.
And I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
So this diversity, in fact, is exactly what we call it to do something different.
Proprio A.
To build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
And this is the difficulty a little, but, if on one hand, it says: I want to create a culture of change, on the other, I need to create leaders of change, that I've worked for many years.
Well, within companies, today, I take care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
But it's not the immediate thing.
The brightest leaders do this too.
And then?
Always, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
But the word change accounts this word of change, I start with something that brings me, I don't know how many hours and starts putting into other words.
The transformation, the creation of creativity, until when, in play, they start putting together these words and forming an act.
Cattoos.
Wow!
Because in reality it's a prison, it's a bit of reach that me.
And of course this is a prosecutive of personal entirety.
And a leader, today, must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an act of change, the creative knowledge of transformation and change.
And what is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income?
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
And then in fact what happens to us.
Instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the prospective change that ...
But what I thought was to take this leap, to do things, to enjoy the sounds.
To work on projects.
Take people from one place to another.
And in this being there is a transformation that even involves you, involves me.
Isn't it?
I'm working on a project, I'm paid on the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and all that I do, thanks to the development of creative thinking, which is a bit of leading it to change this transformation.
Because to do this.
It's true that the work of me, on the other hand, but I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've imagined it, then, through five fundamental purposes, the first one would know about transformation, that is that everyone is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something related to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may be in their houses as a workshop, rather than communication.
But creativity is something that...
Keep waiting for everyone, at the moment of the story you were in.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity.
Sport: "Samattina we started with a tunnel, with brainstorming, it's one of you that allows you to fulfill your life.
FdB: Creativity.
What does creative thinking about working on divergent and convergent thinking, but this is not enough?
And we need to take a leap and ...
And to make a slightly deliberate movement, right?
And starting to involve that which is the emotional part, the frightening of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
Well, to precisely try to express your emotions and emotions, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
So, fear, when I feel that it's not courageous, and to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's this too.
When you know about your emotions, you can allow yourself to depend on the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
Well!
It's the interesting thing to do.
That's it.
CR: It's not that you become indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a modification.
But in fact, no, but you live in a transformation that is personal, consciousness of both emotions leads you to do this.
I want to share with you several examples of leader who have made these tests, just to suffer in Italian fields, certainly deserve.
The Marimets with Rome, but also Chico.
Who conventionally knows that the other day has been awarded as the business of ...
Most global immension, just for innovation, and is growing up to 67%, that is to say what?
Transformations.
But they ask, how to say, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of the world.
Opportunity: we say in management, create the weather.
To me, it's true.
But I'm not so much in the idea of managing.
But how much to nourish?
Because the real difficulty today is to support the leader.
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
But something that has a concrete impact inside organic interactions, what does this mean?
Because nourishing means that every day you build the contents in which people ...
It can beaten on ideas.
It may be a free spiral, it can be a way to relate to it.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not that simple in the organizational environments, because there's always the balance of the results as if the results were collected only in one way.
On the other hand, dare!
I'm leading the opportunity.
To build a weather with its own actions, would I also give it the opportunity to do what?
To explore new definitions.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so we don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, ask a child to imagine something, and in the end, if you ask an adult.
Well, there's a little competition here, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the best, it's better that I don't say it, it's better that I'm in silence, I start all this internal dialogue, and what's interesting when we're in this situation is: "How am I doing?"
Give me to cultivate.
It's the creative spirit.
It's here.
Well, this is precisely the impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, it has an impact that necessarily ...
It's true that this organization doesn't happen, even to reinvented a very customer relationship.
And the prosthesis is completely changed.
Then, to return?
It's to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation?
But to slow down the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in what way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
Well, the sense of attention we have seen in the video before.
It's like saying: guide is the volcano for the development of creative thinking.
But this feels clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all.
The thing of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen first inside of you.
And then out, in a few words, the courage to use.
We are about to act.
Let's light the belt of security.
How many times have you seen the city?
Is it the only time?
But there is a chance in it.
Then, let's see from above.
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most diffused invention of man.
[A.DE.]
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Check it out!
These places to be together can be fun.
Celigan?
To live not all separated, but together.
But what about that?
Let's call it.
That's it.
And you'll have also been ready for the forehead.
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Olimity.
This is a story that goes.
But let's go back in time.
Well, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest tapir.
It's more populous from the West.
And how do you see it?
Maybe not Nega Gankhi.
Well, in fact, in this city.
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
This is it.
It's obviously the growing process.
And these two kids started, then.
CR: Rivember.
Are we quite famous?
Mark!
It's his friend.
Aello.
They were practicing for Mances.
They didn't see what today captivates you when you did your weekend.
New York or Parigi.
(Laughter) Imagine.
Let's go!
Strad and stretch.
Without leaves.
Povere and so on.
(Laughter) Interesting, but not today's true smoke was indeed.
What did carbon parking disorders prevent their view?
And he too.
One with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
Why was it called?
But the conviction?
One of the operating classes in cities.
What?
They refused.
Of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be ...
Wow!
Inquination, insicurity, poverty.
And there was no other way.
What limits this phenomenon possible?
How to say?
A malnutrition.
Then, one thing we need sometimes, but to contain.
And what about that?
Throughout the years, we are 1850.
But in the beginning of Novecento.
(Laughter)
The discipline of tools to limit this phenomenon has given Chiara.
Probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
It's Albania.
What do you see here behind?
One thing?
The tremendous feeling that, maybe, you've ever met, has bizzer tools.
One is called full of service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a change at home, you have to do hundreds of practice.
After that,
The pianification.
The piano is the idea that there is someone from the top.
I wanted to stop imagining?
[A.DE.]
The nature of an athlete.
in the next 50.
Only him is on his forehead, or is it still for the reason why, fortunately, you have never met?
Anyone, but what can you even say?
It's an apphetto.
Who is imagining?
In a centimeter of the city.
What should happen at the bottom?
It's a house.
And here I have a feffice.
I'm a theater.
Pah!
Let's even imagine children.
It's cool.
It's a huge spectrum against cities.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Andes.
A: L'OVR.
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe why did you see the movie?
Do you remember?
Then it becomes a prison where all the world's challenges are launched from the top.
Scannine.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all the processes, this also drove to us a little bit of lungh from 1845.
A window.
Then the sentence came.
The unique case in science.
This feeling is a feeling of absolute absolute absolue.
But not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
Then you find out that the city is not the cause of everyone, then in the world.
Thinking the growth of the population.
It's the solution.
Have you ever asked them?
Who is associated with the human genius.
And demography?
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
Because the confidence of economic development, the creation of work.
The interface.
[A.DE.]
to create knowledge.
In fact, this feeling also fits three.
Importing?
The foundations that motivate this ability, the city.
The first one is to improve the world.
It's density.
What are my daughters?
This is my picture from the upset of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities?
Imagineations that can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That's the fact that not only we are.
How many things in a small place?
Which things are diverse.
Because there are people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks other people who also ignore me the most famous call.
And the third element is creativity.
But this is one thing.
To work on the white night.
Two billion people, for one night, have a tank, a seed home, food, and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
And then?
Here's my idea.
Because the city, in the end, is scared, is it somehow?
Additated how to solve it?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
But the vastness, the people, we are all used to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
And the city works and resolves the greatest question of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I have different interests.
How many individuals from stories?
from regions that have different objectives.
That if you decide to take a trip together in a car, you'll lit all day long.
But now the city has to end magically, counting on such individual interests, in the collective well-being, so the city definition is no longer a definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
So it's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Maybe in this moment ...
But after a million years of history, this ability has proved temporary.
(Anglese) Very good, maybe.
FdB: Neglette, maybe you may consider that right now, or for some useful ones?
But take risks?
Ah, that's it!
So, this virtuous mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
But we must pass by ...
Then, mechanisms of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and that they are not afraid.
Behind the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
They try to feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example.
(Laughter)
At 10,000 years old.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
What about the satellite?
They are evident from some steps.
A group of "verde."
Little people know about the city center.
Ten minutes.
Dal bug.
(Laughter) Who among you?
And that's my idea.
And this is also the journey I've been doing for years with this map.
Vocuation for the city.
Liber.
Dominate.
The group of green, with courage.
Why do you believe in life?
[A.DE.]
They are larger in the world.
It's from two greenometers, a stage B.
That every day you can walk, how do you do it?
Let's go, for example.
Can you see the map?
If you put a magic.
It's a element of diversity and strength.
Treddo.
In positive things?
It's one of the systems we live in.
Don't let us go.
S: Great.
Have you seen it?
What stops?
with spotlines?
900?
It's the first version of a solution.
One of the cities like the local.
Great.
That's me.
I don't know if you've all remember these stories.
And the second example?
And then that.
Namous billion kilometers.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina he captured it.
They were standing here.
What?
Of this city in 2030?
Keep it?
Buenos Aires, more than in other years.
The country is right.
Where is the place?
Everyone sees a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I propose to you.
Addin.
Violence?
From a higher international crisis.
What's the temptation?
Malsa.
That one.
Limitagne zero.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparating the vast!
The strength of this?
Sleeply.
What are they?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I've offered ...
Great catch.
What do development accelerate?
That's it.
Good afternoon for the activity.
A magician in frutture.
Ciao!
If you pedaled or checked.
Picture in 2030.
Not in imitating, but increasing a billion.
How many more in life?
Situing?
Four yesterday?
Yes, with lensiest quarteries.
But the population not only of the agency, but also of the whole world.
I used to see ayer?
Build a system?
What's the point?
And even more in this development to accelerate, and then, what do I say?
Pays of social media.
Diver and...
What about this?
Readvices.
They were about the development of Buenos Aires.
Hi?
Sound.
Well, the solution to all of us is the world.
When?
I'll tell you.
Sitting the spot on the spotlight, you will keep it above.
It's this great invention.
Humanity.
You hope that in your heart you're feeling different and you know how to answer that question.
Have you seen seven posts?
How many times!
Can you imagine that?
You're very proud.
To live in what we call.
The section of ego.
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
It has never been our thoughts.
And the words of our language?
They are extraordinary, they are vocative that are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion.
Behind, I'm waves.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
It has to do with this beautiful beauty.
Tuterata, preserved, perceptible.
FdB: No, come.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'm going to talk about art.
A huge idea.
It's from the English year, the school.
Provincial, motivated, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But the penetrated a little longer.
And will I start to show you?
Some endless twins.
They have many Latins on their insecutions and the largest universities in the world, and they show them with a big budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana, in Corea.
(Laughter) It works.
Ideas!
In the leg united to the Kins College de Ronda, on the coast united to Oxford.
G: In Chicago, in the United States.
Wow!
(Laughter) They say "you" in their insecurity.
Well, not only.
I: The unexpected one.
Surely.
(Laughter) You may say if you're in Latin, well!
TED: Londra has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada.
It has a lattive device.
The 15L, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not just that.
(Laughter) "Medicana," she always says in the end, her senses are given.
In a thousand film.
But the British marine speaks in Latin, and even an institute there's no tone to be a passwoman.
Like NASA.
(Laughter) Take a Latin motto to the Apollo emission.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a single place in the world.
In which a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Cool.
The active.
Have you seen that?
AC: Instead.
What is the ABC recent?
It's a nose.
A physicist from the city of Rome.
Approbate was a blind.
[A.DE.]
But from the municipalities, in the past?
And that's it.
What?
How should we pronounce this [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese]
Wow, Mendyu!
This funding.
What is it?
Contamination!
I've traveled on two blankets, hanging and jumping.
What are the five words with them?
And one is asked.
We keep it.
The twisty of all cities in the world there is no one.
The thing is essential.
Then I'll give you her name.
Let's move.
Give it?
Just one.
(Laughter) "But then, did you have your feet?"
Let's give you a total footprint.
Studies.
(Laughter) Please, get involved.
Come on.
The Ministry of Benecuto, see them beautiful.
That's it.
(Laughter) Not really beautiful to see, Beautiful.
We are the English Italians in a way for insensal life.
Well, I don't like us, I don't even like nonsense, which is the thing.
It's curious, that's it.
In Italy, no?
Let's use an Italian code, right?
I'd like to say, I'm talking about it.
But the most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
I think it's a bit self-driving.
The most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents.
(Laughter) The fourth most studied language in the world, neither studies have the Italian to do business, study, or because they have it.
But for the kitchen, for fashion.
for the operation.
Perry.
For the history, for the dancers.
That's why they study it.
B.G: We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, become male.
Please.
[A.DE.]
G: The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us pizza.
Here you can see the map of the maps.
And if it comes to the United States, it was confronted with the mind.
I started negotiating with the quantity of the same business map that sell.
Hamburghedo.
Hotdox.
Let's start!
The world is male.
[A.DE.]
That's it.
Why do we here in Italy have guilty?
Let's change.
Wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Mility.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
What happens?
The nottories have.
Everything changes.
The Italian wine of Colovino.
New York's data.
Happy and delegants.
If they sell food and wine?
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's give food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
It's what scratches the paper.
Rivist, Italians in a way.
What about him?
We try to turn them off, more glinely, directly.
The head of the word "follow."
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
And he said, "Mommy explain, I ask you who told me."
Give it occult.
(Laughter) "What if it were an idea?
It was a mountain in "Goen Kenio."
And what about it?
"Let's go!"
It's how we make our events.
And the women we see in ours?
Good afternoon for Nash.
Perfect.
[A.DE.]
But you see women, there's no heart.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy and it speaks English.
I'm only two Italian words: the first one.
What is happening to us if we even get the symptom?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's look at our radicies we love here."
And the Argentinian, this: "I join on-s."
Riuniosi.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalized.
We are segmented.
The curious thing, why?
Oh, Fedou is palletic!
(Laughter) Italian they don't, no.
Then I don't like it's an English word.
60% of 2012 we say that this is not 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we can see it.
It's from here.
I want to make the medical abilities of the sign...
I've compiled the sign that I've compiled this model.
One is improved by linguistic competition.
"Your left!"
Every day, for drugs, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems model to us, because we are orto-vinted.
We have a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
"No!"
When essentially you enter the thesis of the Italian language, she has purely access and...
AR: Inutti.
CR: We said colors, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I heard them say, "The bucket is the "lockering" that we chose for the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
AC: The athletes can feel, we must schedule a set of toothpaste lines joining the athlete versatisfaction.
With business it's united.
I'd like to say, we have to call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because then the unite business is always "Pipo Franco."
In English, email speaks not only in companies, but also in media: public recording.
The Govern.
But we have a law from the State called Jobs√®ke.
And I assure you that the fact that Jobset didn't give him the most friendly.
It's forced.
Going to Giobatt's newspapers, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, we did a bit of a house.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, to put a start on the internet in foot.
Fat.
Sensibilization activates this problem.
FdB: Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and waste, and a little bit of energy.
What about this pet?
What do you want to invite?
Public public records, the government!
The printers, the media, to say it.
In Italian, and the ratings were first at the Cusca Academy because it was the protagonist of this sensibilization company, we were waiting for a discourse, but not what happens.
But in less than a month they filmed, by putting a name, a cup, a dirty, and there are 70,000 people.
Nurturbate everyone.
Good afternoon, old.
Pauli Gloppies and people who didn't spray that the workshops signed up the toys and the students signed.
Let's start.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed up hundreds of professionals and they had elevated thinkers, signed.
It's Italian and the west.
I said, "What's wrong with our language and they signed storers and Eni?"
In a movie, the whole world.
A: Yes.
Singapode, the genuine keeps it, it keeps it.
Africa and the North Africa.
From Canada.
No, it's something with a movement, I did it.
A: Ode.
To look at these signs that grew up, we could read the motivations.
I'd like to talk to you about someone.
Italian is a right, but also a doer.
And we're in noved at FUFA.
(Laughter) If we think abundantly, we'll talk more secondly about tango: workers in an administrative public, help.
Figno, because I studied classic studies, "Oh, I work with economists."
Words in fashion, I've received a prize of risk, it's not penendiplious and the trend, I don't think there's any.
(Laughter) An Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Swiss.
(Laughter) And we know how to lose.
This is one of the most.
Stay pretty well.
So, I have a new slam, but italian parliament, says, "Cchung, go to Rome food."
And so it starts to let me decrease our language.
Because you can't say, "Senty day, it's funny to split this."
(Applause) Dante, Montal, Caproni, Paese, Banguts, why?
I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to talk about tables' bubbles, but you can remember the range of campaigns, but you do.
And that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
We fill because I've met teachers and universities that say displete, instead, that they visualize.
Very good.
Because it's not just the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take this initiative, I'm 85 years old, thanks for a motorcycle.
That's it.
(Laughter) I just said.
A echo.
It's challenged to discharge, because mass media has trapped that which is due to zero cost.
And does not amplify it?
And this initiative has been used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and in imaginable, they have spoken together grammarins and will be on the crack of public news.
But I had great applause as well as security and welcome.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vaniti Ferra talked about this.
He is not affected, family, Christian.
He spoke to me about the Mexico of Turing, he has spoken today that behind him made a publishment: azensity.
Why?
It is estimated all the usual tree, also a little core and a little here, and that you are deeply committed to stop.
Dimicchia is hated.
What are the most populated?
And you've often had a great desire to laugh at each other with knowledge and consciousness of our language.
And these things end up the newspapers, it has also touched me.
You look at yourself, "Hey, it's a bear, I went to talk about you."
She was pregnant from the eradium, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from an abandonment.
That's it.
We need that.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We don't have all stretches.
The Italian.
And did I find it rich?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to dare the right success.
Our language, the future.
This is a value, it's a fact of your emotions.
Let's talk?
The door goes on, the door.
Believe it in the world, why does it represent us?
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
Very good: he also protects the brain, through the most of a language, but switching theingue, uses them one to the voice.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten it.
So, who talks, how do you eat?
A: Not the best.
And then ...
"That doltine is tolerated!"
FDB: On the first of the talks of these days?
The messages that defined this sign.
S: Homo Sanzalitter.
Because he scratches in volcano, in Italian.
(Laughter) Anyway.
And the structure, the form of decency.
The Italian language helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
We resign one of those pecurialities.
One of the caldious things.
(Laughter) Wonderful!
Potentiality.
On our own.
Specifically, Italian creativity, which is the ten in your mother language.
And yet, if our linguistic thesis is "fuck," used to this, we can make some extra fears, why is it charity?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fulfilling.
The logo.
In a sense measurement, we must have an excess, a finalist, or a misuse.
But why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, in Italian.
With our identity?
Behind our radicies, our history.
With our openness to the world.
Our own from our homes.
When a guy stares at me.
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
If that person also has something.
"And your mom?"
What happens?
What happens to you?
And when mom or her grandma or her ambitions?
I started to look bad if I was still a child.
A teenager, when I was a teenager, didn't have the hardest idea of being a young man in the school, as everyone went to school, asked and dressed with friends.
But what's behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
B.G: Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
Probably?
I was part of my age telling me that I still love channels, and I changed my hair.
But what is invisible in those photos, what has led me from my mother, who you see in the center, to my adulthood, who I'm currently going through my adolescent who you see on record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called the health problem, and when one in two parents hits, and you still have a child, the teenager, they are your reference points.
It was really complicated.
What if I tell you what it is?
The problem of health?
Is it a mental health problem?
The caregiver for a child?
And it can be very heavy.
And it can be made of senses than that.
What is it?
The sadness, love, hate that alternate, take care of it.
It's the constant feeling of walking on the shoulders.
It's an eccessive charge of responsibility.
It's the difficulty to focus.
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
Mahhh...
In addition to this.
Giving power must have its own emergencies, for the core.
Stop.
How to manage, but when your father or your mother saw many things that psychologists don't exist.
Or to have to do with alternating in a gold and depressive way, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, setting up, the treatments of suicide.
But how do we add all this?
But I had to continue my life as well as always, going to school, studying.
The reason I'm here today is that you add another character, that sometimes you can't talk to anyone.
16?
So that your mother or Tobabana, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will hear it for that or will remind you of parents' problems or deities.
But hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and destined to be automatic to eredit the same disorder.
But if I tried to say, "Hey, what about your mom or your grandmother?"
They have a metaphoric disorder, a bipolar a schizophrenia, or if there is not even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say.
Mamma or dad, something that doesn't give.
But the answer of the foreign world will be completely different.
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good.
It took us all.
And this brings a way to understand what's happening inside you to your own affection, a bit to ask and receive sometimes not to receive them.
[A.DE.]
For you that if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
First of all, you perceive the difficulty of communicating inside the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the embarrassment.
You begin to have everything inside and not say exactly anything.
But loneliness, in silence, I'm a heavy musician to bring, for a wormer: How did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born.
A heart of ice cream that allowed me to be afraid, anger, and pain, to prevent people around me from turning around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans, but that at the same time made me grow up before others.
In its time.
There were also...
A bunch of help, a bunch of help that couldn't be able to pull, that no one in the school imagined.
When the first grade started an extremely beautiful, in that horn, when the first time the light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consultant who is the first person in the family member.
The one I've been able to open and that helped me, on the piano, is to see people sitting around me the strength that they could be supported.
But the truth and the right "scchia"?
Is it Bern√©?
On the Internet, on the forum, on the stories.
So from other children, from other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that had brought me to the trips.
And the stories of our children of parents with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has held me and that we have in common.
And that we're often convinced of being the only one.
But it's statistically impossible: in the world we are millions of people.
However, we invited us to try it, that there is no other person who has lived the same things we've lived on us.
And you know why it happens, because our children's stories we don't talk about.
Through stories.
CR: Children, activists, from Australia, USA and Canada?
Not only could I give a name to the emotions I had experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I had experienced, but I could also see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent side by myself, and I went to see in Canada for the first conference I spoke about.
To meet these children, to talk to them, and it was a moment of positive or powerful thinking.
Because their view, the story I've experienced, but also that of writing, their view, the pain, but also the ability to interact, to transform that pain together with a change, I've seen those positive characteristics of resilience, empathy, courage, and willing to change the scope that I hadn't recognized in me.
But that seeing the reflection in them I finally felt my own.
The encountered me was an owner, an huge owner.
It still gives me energy, and it's an owner that I strongly returned in Italy, in Europe.
To help other comfort zones, other forgotten children, to be able to take off their swallows.
The wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel alone when one, in both parents, begins to suffer from a psychic disorder.
It's a huge desire that needs everyone's help.
Why other measures?
As not to risk again to draw the weight of the world all around my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today: in 2017 with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo.
We started the first Italian association, created by children for other children, called "Comit, Pacile, Noffmentaly, Parence, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
We gave the journey to a project called "The Little Mermaid," that I wrote.
And that I'd have again in my hands when I was 15 years old, it's called.
When mom or dad teaches something that doesn't work, she survived me for parents' children with mental disorder and it's a project that is ...
Thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people next to me, some of them are here in this room now.
They've believed in this same desire, they've given us the influence to start and do it.
Slowing high.
This project has an annual way of giving a team of this mini guide to all school libraries, citizens.
All the doctors and scientists sedentary in Italy, because no child left alone, but also their families.
Especially the children of parents who don't know about their issues and don't even know how to deal with their issues, and even these children must think: I was one of them for a while.
And at first, when I thought about this project ...
And I have details.
I'll never make it realise, how will I do it?
But on the piano, I asked people around me, and also the scursionists guide, proposing to tell during a floor, in ten minutes, the story.
And finding so many people in the civil society that might not have experienced these experiences.
And they wanted to become our own possessions, change, and bring a box of mini guides in the owner of our part to the library of their communities.
And now we are able to reach so many regions, from the open beach, until the Sicily, at the Sardegna, we don't stop it, we want to reach them all.
Another wish we have is that, I mean, to give up the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
The other huge desire we're realizing is to meet schools, to talk to the students, to the kids.
Not only Filliger Liber, but everyone.
And to have a house of atoms to make front of you.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the life's face.
Stop being obsessed, first what it is.
It's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
Mah...
There's one thing I know.
It's one of the positive characteristics that our parents' parents have mental disorder.
It's the will to change the scope.
And that's why.
Because I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, and also thanks to you.
If this story had harassed, I was motivated.
Tell them, tell them about your friends, your colleagues.
Together with the bottle that wasn't open for us.
Let's get the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Aron-sfare.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I will surely play a hacker in common sense.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Four years ago, they were in a group that wrote down, maybe you don't say much, but it was ugly in the fridge until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something that is called a reddit, becomes a millionaire from one day to another, but they, honestly, didn't take so much money or fame, continues to do what has always done to build a open and collaborative Internet.
Well, we collapse with the Internet archaive and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving.
You will finish, haveabytes, the Internet, your preferences will be a lot of trouble, they're fans of digital memory.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the ticket against theppa, a battlefield that ...
Any year ago, even Wikipedia, had to be a monopoly.
But going to play out, because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
Well, what Nareon absolutely collapsed is an extraordinary, fantastic, anderocious, curiosity.
Aaronna told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 year old books: all languages, from the economy to political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
KP: He was facing the capital of March under his 16-year-old.
Aaron told her brother in a very touched moment of the documentary that was absolutely expected to see, and he had learned how to learn prestibly: she told her mother that, at some point, she was carrying out, and a Aaron was two and a half years old, hanging in the segelone and explained to her on the fridge she had just attacked with her.
The calamite.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents memory, the RSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creators of Commos are a copyright, so they make it accessible to people.
It's about content, creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element.
As banals, that is, information is power.
The information is power.
What about us?
We just need to think of a second, everywhere, we go to schools, libraries, universities.
Power information comes from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
Let's make a democratic act: our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
The fact that Aron came to this ...
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
What if all institutions are social?
They are people's facts, so fundamentally they're culture, so they're fundamentally made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
[A.DE.]
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Hazes.
It's a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many, big publishers.
They made the keys of power, making it...
What scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
And I said, "There were...
QD: It's passionate about this, scratch this thing called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy.
And the first steps were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
And it's supported.
Love B.I.
And he had ...
Attention.
It's not a hacker.
Of this genius, it's probably not happening to observe.
He understands that his opportunity to give an example.
Well, they want to give you an example to show all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a pair of code taste.
A: Yes.
With Harwin, he's already made of a veracity and its technical persecution, for having scared hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats, and he could do it, but not in this scenario, and they've been answered informal Pharmacy attacks, up to 35 years.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first treasure.
They arrived at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it.
Because information is power.
If you decide to be the engineer who holds the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined of the disadvantages around you.
Something we've seen recently.
FdB: With Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure styles, people who wanted to give access to information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
CP: You talk.
- There you go.
You need to do this.
Money, go!
But he also sent all the tickets to watch.
Mr.C.
(Audience) If you talk.
[A.DE.]
Now I ask you to do this.
Money, go!
"Yeah, no!
And this is more important for prospective: E39 is Streetland of Streetland, Spanish, E39 is Sterrabone, is Streetland of Sweb for Caching Challenge or Saie.
Intervistator: What happened?
Let's do it!
Guess what Jestan Bot!
In addition, the cane is a month, even if it's not a can, and the cane is a huge, active cane.
This is Alexander, a monk in the winter.
CB: You're sorry!
And so, after the last years, this time I love being a beautiful eternal thing, it's a simpler thing.
Who's a Rondice?
FdB: Something?
It's essential.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
A mass spioning team, is used for...
To spy, to check, to express, but there is also another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, liberate, a full space, freedom of expression; actually, these things are equal to the same way, the Internet is too complex.
It's to be just one thing.
What's going on?
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
But I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with someone's words.
Betty: There you go.
And to make the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here.
The hell we live every day, which we form is together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning continues.
Trying to know who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell.
And to make them last and put them inallel.
in 1950.
It was a while eating with some physical bonds in the back of the lab of Losalamo.
And I do it improvedly.
Behind, I solved the look of theattoo and it dominated.
Are all here?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
He wasn't mindful, no, he had made a reason.
And in our galaxy there are hundreds of thousands of brains, most of them are closer to our Sun.
The oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half.
It's the result of years.
Be, then, if life was in parallel?
Any other planet.
Here's one of those very ancient sisters, so much earlier.
This is what we can see on Earth, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the point of view.
Technology, with millions of years of advantages that we might have already traveled between stars.
But, we've never been spoken in any of these intelligible civilities hypothesis.
And here's the question to close, I mean, where are all the many?
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it's been a lot more simple, it's that there is no one out there.
We're alone.
So, this is possible.
I think this is a question that we've asked all of us how many, before or after, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a stelling sky.
I was wondering if around those bright lights could be planets, about those living beings' gifts, which, perhaps, were staying at my vocation and they were asking the same question I was facing anchemy.
And now I'm doing astrophysics, I'd like to find a scientific answer to this question: are we alone in the universe?
And I truly believe that finding evidence that there is life, outside the earth, would be an evocous change for our species.
It's also for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
For centuries, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are physically at the center of the universe, there is no one at the center of the universe, because there is no center in the universe.
Well, a seventh and a half ago Charles Darwin explained to us that our species has been learned with all other species of the planet, actually we come here, we all descend from an old unit.
It's common, and I want to find scientific evidence of the existence of other worlds inhabitants, I believe it would be a third, a great revolution.
Incredible, maybe even better.
Only two other two.
To bring.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps forward in the vocation of a possible answer: we still don't have an answer, but we are the first human beings.
To have scientific evidence that there are pianists around other stars: this is one of the biggest identities in astrophysics, in the last 20 years, we could have been able to suspect it.
Then, there were other planets out there, but now we have proves, we know thousands of planets around other stars already, and we hypothesize that, most likely, each store of our galaxy, has at least one planet, so we're talking about gigantic numbers.
There are hundreds of billions of planets that we know, in reality, we also know that many of them are.
And they are at the same distance from their bottle to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so of husband and oceans on their surface.
And this is one of the requirements that we think is essential for life, as we know it, and even, according to some statistical states, we could see in our galaxy, 11 billion actions to life.
Right or potentially because we are truly moving the first steps, so we don't have a definitive evidence.
that one of these planets is effectively ...
But it's inevitable that we have tools that are studying them, and in the next few years of the light confinement that came from these remote villages, we can understand many things, to see, for example, if they have an atmosphere, what elements are made of this atmosphere, so to understand if, in fact, there are the conditions for the presence of life, and even not too far, we could dig in these planets, maybe.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be witnesses at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I'm sorry, I believe it would be an epocal change for all of us.
One of the questions we could ask is that often, in fact, it's done, we'll never reach these other planets, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us.
From an ocean of green space, the universe is truly very big, and then I'll give you an example, a particular example.
It's this probe, myallels and you to Geruno, it's the spacial control built by man.
And it has increased even more.
It's from the ground.
And on the trip of a quarantine years ago, it arrived at the stars of the Solar System, entered the space in testing, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed, 60,000 kilometers back then.
We came to seventy kilometres per second.
So it's a huge speed, but I mean, how much this one's going to add.
But this space probe for us to reach the closest athlete in our country, Proxima Centauri, if they travel in that direction, it would bring us 74,000 years.
It's a longer time than any human race.
Good afternoon.
Speaking of our planet.
But we could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that it is.
And it travels the maximum speed consent in nature.
FdB: Impact.
For more than four years to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that, so also to communicate on radio with other systems that would ask hundreds or thousands of years of education, the reaction of an answer.
So it's all very complicated, maybe we're not alone in the universe, but we certainly seem isolated.
We are financed.
I'm sorry.
For a sea of green space, and then, for me, here is one of the things to be present when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of ants, and then the interrogative in reality that we all have, is right where there are many.
(Laughter)
The fact that being present is time, so we're talking about time.
And they use it.
Let's give an example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand master's hand and the tip of my left hand.
It's the transitional time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, 4 billion in the middle of the years.
Very good.
And the first forms of life, the cellular units, the antennas, which, in all forms of life, never spoken on our planet, even the ones themselves.
Before, these complaints are quite close, some of them are in the palm of the hand.
And then these microorganisms ...
They call life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, they differentiate with natural selection, the evolution, and only here.
But at the center of the hand, there is the explosion of shape.
There are multicellular organisms, the most completed on a network of billions of billions of cells, animals, plants.
The dinosaurs compassionate.
FdB: Who?
At the end of the palm of your hand drowning.
"Yes."
And at the beginning of the last failure, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely to have the impact of a large asteroid, to take it from the earth together to three quarters of living species at that moment on the planet.
And the combinations of these peoples, big ones, have been many times throughout this long history.
One of the life.
On Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have lived on this planet have disappeared.
So this gives us the idea that this long history, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long, difficult, accident, governed by little.
They are unbelievable events and that shouldn't be necessarily brought to the origin of the most complex organisms and not that we should bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species, it's an idea, we in all this where we are.
(Laughter) Well.
It's the whole history of humanity.
It's at the end of an ugly: we could hide the road completely with a Lima's harp.
And this has already happened because we know it today.
That for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been with us other human species that are no longer there, like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe, there's a little the key of all this.
- Yes.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there is another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms, the first extraterrestrial ones that could be simple batteries, the pregnancy could be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be shocking, incurable, compared to life times.
of the Universe.
Maybe they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they've applied a certain level of technological progress, to feed themselves, or simply get involved with harassment, they spark, without leaving any trace in the universe.
A huge cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a bit of a kind of warning, maybe we are saying something.
And life had to overcome it?
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species.
Behind, from far away, let's imagine ourselves coming from another planet.
Well, if we sparkle...
Besides, probably in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
But we're a very young species: we're a very young species, just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate through radio, through a fifty years ago, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived at the confines of the Solar System, but we ended up putting the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos that surrounds us, and I think that closing us here would truly be a little bit like this.
As differences of dinosaurs, we have, at least in part, the chance of...
To change, to influence our destination.
We certainly have the capacity to empower ourselves, but we also have, as I believe, and I hope.
It's the chance to help scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day.
It's life.
On some other planet, maybe in a far away future, even if we can reach other stars.
If the out there are super galatical intelligences, as you see in the fantastic movies, then the only hope to be part of it.
The problem with the claim of these galaxic intelligences is to survive as long as possible, we stay hard, and if we were all alone in this space.
Well, I believe that even more we have the opportunity to keep access until we reach this.
It's beautiful, wonderful, that splitness of consciousness, park in case.
It's a small planet that's lost in the middle of the cosmos.
Thank you.
KP: The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not in sport.
The fact of Vitoria.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before, classifies, but the sport did and generates.
positivity and positive things for others?
A sport.
Maybe it's...
Then, when you believe you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength.
To believe.
G: I'm here, in this photo, to ...
And I'm running, yes, because I run, I like running.
And here I was in Namibia, during the first cover of a very hard trip.
A trip made of 144 km that later became 100, I joined two, because Centro Quattro was another people.
No, I've added two, because you're an important number of you.
It's a number that will come back more or less.
This is a long story.
What about us?
I'm me in the end.
Of these 116 Chileans with all of us.
Good afternoon everyone.
The runners, instead of running, are instead of being worried about the world.
To get the first ones.
I've got to the last.
We came all together after these 100.
Tognate the man.
And the journey is the first difficulty.
But right now, during the first days, we were terrified to Windoc.
Later, inside the map, and after six hours of trip.
It's enough.
The difficulty came in my desert, the desert.
The oldest in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics that I chose for this kind of gates.
And here is another chance.
And the petitoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number I still know: this Saturday I know is an important number.
Is it a name?
This is the first part.
It's the first tap in the window.
But the first cover is a night cover, a 15 km cover, so it's very simple, it's done, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
But we do them.
Well, during our attitudes.
But the desert is in general, the race is a bit like the metaphor of life, no, you begin to do things.
Later, during life, the unexpected happen.
And also in the darkness happens to the imprevists, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman.
I thought time is essential.
To do something beautiful.
Anyway, it's better to go forward.
G.G.
There's always the chance.
AD: You react.
And me, the first difficulty, I had him after three Chileans.
Actually, I couldn't bother.
And I couldn't bother why?
Because in this garage was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga, an important initiative to collect basic income in their lives.
Control to neuroplastol.
The neuroplastone is a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, me before that experience.
But unfortunately, there are many others that are in this moment too.
So my goal was to make these 116 Chileans.
Funding funds to give hope to these children, and when they're in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert, because they know it.
I do calculus.
Very calm, in Namib's desert, in the high school stages, it takes 61 grades, it's true that 61 grades away, right?
It's during the long run marathon of 42 kilometres that is lasted as it requires 7 hours of running.
I've had various problems, threats, feature, scoring was doing this.
Why did we have to move forward?
It's our window.
When it's done, it's used, or nearly this was the beginning of the second cover, that A.
A bit lighter, it becomes a kilometer, so nothing dramatic.
Well, it was a park.
To Bella, a cover that started.
To make me think, a magnifying glass that started to appear even the seventh of the ground, the heat, right?
What's up?
And in a desert.
The comincia desert has taught me so much, has taught me that we are very often, right?
And we also feel during the whole world.
Build it, during all our work activities, inhabitable, right?
We feel inhabitable, we feel.
A lot.
But unfortunately, in the desert you find out that you're a punch, it's a cast, maybe where you arrive around you and I run around 15, 20 km where there's nothing.
And when you run 15, 20 km where it's arrived, there's nothing.
You realize how small we are and also teaches you that life's things ...
But they are not just cellulare, or the final dress, absolutely many youths to be happy must have a cellulare, right?
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus in a tank.
And at some point, in the middle of the desert, a night that moved to eat was closed.
It depends on the pulmine, it scends it.
In this desert, it's going to take a stove.
From one blanket.
And she says, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this photo."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the wage I didn't know if he knew it.
I don't know if you know that with salt ...
I can make them eat.
And I don't know if you know, but what is the result of doing medicine as well?
He was happy for the exit.
Now we don't have to be happy.
It's probably just for survival, it's good to be happy.
But of many other things, but it's also important.
Sometimes it's better how fortunate we are, right?
The amibian desert is the desert that I chose, why?
Because inside the Nanamai Pesiste desert is the highest Duna in the world, more than 300 meters.
And when you know there, we made it rain or almost.
It's in the corner, you can see it there on the tip of the gang that was spread on the other side.
It's like touching the sky, because my desert doesn't exist.
So, when you know, she's high.
It's an incredible thing.
To be out of the Duna is not easy, and I ran little, I was walking a lot.
What happens?
When did they arrive?
On the bridge.
Well, it's the duna.
Other more, Chileans were missing alone.
It's Equila.
But it's already in Chile that's also corresponding to lobbies.
The pack of the world here in Namibia and do it.
[A.DE.]
I bet.
Incredible.
Your mank no.
Seven messs?
Fourth Chileans, fratello, three, two.
"Why am I walking full, I'm happy?"
Thanks to all of you that I've been strong.
Wow!
Tchau, tchau.
It's my door.
(Laughter)
(Audience) I love me.
This is a citizen.
I talked about the small principle of my well-being and I found it.
How many people?
And they shared me if it wasn't another 26 people.
I'll count.
Ascendent, 96.
27 people who have run with me.
Fine, the last two kilometers could also not do them.
It's full of 104.
I have a lot.
The magic has already been achieved.
Then you can see them were all very agile during the talk.
[A.DE.]
CR: It can't be ridiculous.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to get there.
In the end of the ufficious lady, you can go back and do the other Chilean, and then come back back backwards.
It'd be 1006.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to get to these children.
BB: Inne, Chileans are really inside, the number 6, a number 6.
I know, they seem important and recurrent, the interesting thing we do.
We arrived in the end.
It's the fundious recipe.
With its objective.
On December 20th, 2016.
(Applause) That if you take the city.
BB: They are exactly the figures that make 116 km.
Or 16 per two.
200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that.
"Oh, I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for everyone."
You could also run away, I was like that, maybe a little more, I had 40, more friends.
But I wasn't very sports.
I have to move forward.
To the sin.
But do people rifle?
Surely.
It's 100 meters long and it's.
And we're already doing that.
But what's more than having a wife that's enough to move forward?
I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who was already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years difference, this is the first day of school, and nothing, Riccardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first elementary.
And I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his place, Pietro Pan in Gengu, obviously he had already understood, well, the situation.
But, unfortunately, life sometimes crossed us hard things, no.
of life.
[A.DE.]
It's a bit like...
Like the corsa.
What I've just mentioned before, in the end, fatigue, sometimes you should know how to react.
And that's what happened.
And this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
And this is celebrating hemorrhology.
The photography is a celebrating hemorrhage, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November.
During the first days of school, and this brain neurology was caused by an arterovenous malformation we didn't know during birth.
And it has lasted hardly, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
A: Yes.
"When?"
But when did it look?
And when did it seem like everything went well?
[A.DE.]
And it's 18.
February.
But in 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too expensive.
S: Okay.
So ...
The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
And one ...
Surely not me.
I: No, no.
But I don't want to give you an impression.
And in these moments?
You don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
Continuing?
(Applause) Continuing to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And, in Riccardo, continue to move forward in life and give the chance to the other two that arrived: did MM arrive?
It has never arrived on January 29th to San Pietra.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and anchus couldn't drop me, so absolutely, what did I have to do?
Keeping to create or improve my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but above all from there.
Not from physical point of view.
To give people strength, right?
And to be me, stronger.
So I started running the first image you see on record.
It's my first marathon mix, inside the Reina de Milion, and then another DNA, one year after the first marathon, the Reina de Verde will be a beautiful one, and until I got to this garage.
I ended up arriving, as I said, in the Namibia desert, where these 16 Chileans have brought me.
To win this medal, but to help a lot of children, they also needed, and you can see the small house, those symbols I've done it with addition, and I'm me and I'm Pietro, and that's why I wanted to take around 21200 euros.
Because it's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
And this year in November went to the Omann desert and Chileans will be 165, so here, there are many combinations.
165 km is totally in self-sufficience.
So they give me only the water, we can get to the end, but it's a diverse desert, but the objective is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them to do better.
The message that I'm here today is an important message.
Anyone is.
The difficulties we can have.
Behind, big or pictures that are, there's always a hope for everyone, to do a lot of things.
To leave.
Because life is a bit like we call a bottle.
And today we are here.
And today is 176.
Behind 2010.
Three times I know, come with me.
But how do you want to interpret it?
Thank you very much.
