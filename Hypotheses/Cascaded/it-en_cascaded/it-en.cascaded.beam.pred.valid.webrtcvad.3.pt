(Music) (Music) [Inglese] One, two, three, three, three.
In 2016, I was given a reward from the National Forticing Forum.
As a sponsorized by the Minister of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly.
Necessarily, they are full of advice.
The motivation of this first was my availability to confront the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient: Let's imagine that this is...
A big university class.
I always enter in class.
The first ten minutes, when the students come in and are seven.
According to my computer irrigation and put a classic music.
I think this is the first step.
To create data environments, fewer failing forms, and try to maintain high expectation of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative.
To transmit the knowledge to the students.
It's precisely with this method that I'd like to start my neuron reading.
Continuing to describe a topic.
You can see everyone's neck already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories I tell in children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942.
Together.
Blockchain park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
Tanziliary has King's College of Cambridge.
He had a research dot in the Princeton Unit, in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
It's hard.
stigma.
It was common the machine to write.
The digital operator was detastated.
But, older than setting on a paper.
In reality, letters are stamp out other letters, second.
A code imposed mechanically under the machine.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper had in front of you a text without meaning.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing.
One...
One of the main figures to "black".
Putting them and constructing them a car.
It's the one you can see.
Dietro: How can we decipher?
This test is written by Tedesco.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about the minded rivista.
computer and machine learning.
Does anyone proposes the tension test?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
Are we familiar with one more person?
Keep it and use the computer.
He may ask questions, and on the other hand, a MC machine.
It's a operator or an operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the person P.
She says that the machine started to overcome Turing's test.
If the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question comes from the person?
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
What's the moment they get?
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neurons.
It's psychology.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
We've heard about Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead?
Socrates are dead.
This is an active argument.
Both premises.
Very good?
A conclusion was conducted: from here the deductive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
Is it near to build deductive arts?
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people?
Initiality.
We must act.
It must be adapted to this.
You have to set goals, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects.
Riforming Turing's quote, a machine can think.
We can say, is it possible to make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the aim of creating intelligent artificial entities.
Your phone is an accent.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
And what about this?
Do you know what I mean?
It is near to build intelligent artificial integrities and supported human beings.
It's a cycle.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents, according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I want to explain to you another example.
Eight managers are the agents that benefit better than all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that solve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, do you think that a young man has been rising for some years?
This is the starting point of the Rubik cube.
It has resolved it in 4.73 seconds.
Any month ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve in 0.63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, the game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the camp is...
The face of scacks, shakes, landscapes, battled by artificial people.
We have human rights agents, those who act almost like all people.
For example, in the game of the Pker Texano.
I will ask the question of the election.
We looked at the "maning."
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
We are talking about the fridge.
How is it?
Mela.
What are we talking about?
From the bus of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world.
A place of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
Let's go now in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest in America has been introduced to this word of technological monolarity.
Arts of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line...
which indicates human intelligence ascendent.
Now imagine a green line that indicates robot intelligence.
with an exponential apartment.
This is a sad moment.
Remember?
I'm preparing in the wallâ€™s law.
Why?
Computational compassion, for example, is measured with the number of transistors inside a chip.
It was two years old and it was quadruplicated every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It comes from this computational compassion to stimulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then?
In 2045 and theindic is the moment when technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his articulum.
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing didn't just propose her test.
One also proposes nine observations.
Control his same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
For a student is the University of Varese.
I followed a course of epistimology, of ethical disorder of computer science, suffered from the ocean.
A decim, unfortunately, has left us a few years ago, one of the complaints we had to manage was proposed.
I met Twing's test.
I'll tell you artificial intelligence.
And I was the only one to propose?
An obvious response is formulated with mathematical communication.
"What is the stupidity of human?"
Would you like to write in simple terminals, let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
Tell the seed.
The symbol of the summit has the lead to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
We don't have it.
An equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
Let's start with the first question.
I can use machines to think.
I'd like to share with you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
[A.DE.]
Good afternoon.
(Applause)
But how many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely by hand.
I've spent the last three years, many photos with my phone, and I'm a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who absolutely makes me a photographer.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here to discuss.
We can consider the map of the photographs a new linguistic language as it influences the issue of the vision that the forms of complication, technical consciousness that exists in the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer.
It still does the difference compared to the simple gesture of a smart phone.
And how does photography cells change the forms and structures of professional photography in order to find answers to these questions I tried to face a confront?
With photographer, accurators, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflexes.
I took the photos of professionals who, for the first, already ten years, opened the challenge of this new middle, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the experts, of their share experiences through the cellulare.
(Laughter)
To find answers around me.
And I arrived to New York, at the DESC of Tort photography in New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
What about Parigi?
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
(Applause)
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big community places of contemporary.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to simply belong to a global narcissistic disorder and to get in touch with some psychologists who supported the disorder of body dismorphism and to rethink, simply, to a global narcissistic disorder, or may not be seen as a shaking agency.
As an identified setting, as a supermarket rebuilt in its image, as it's playfully reivindicated by visibility to the female artist like "Kateard Ben."
Or Ash Roagger, the thermal therapy that has shaped and still secrets both our mobile vision.
This is my dream, Zazzi, who is the victim of my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's epidemic to be happy.
Or, as sociologist Bornata has sustained in New Yorkenson, it can't be let to the police of more complex fators of nature.
Social, storage, economical persino.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
Because it's called "I Revolution," joined in a history of mobile photographs, because in front of the floor of images we were married to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of mobile photographies is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is strongly remarked by the process of labouring certainties, so brilliantly identified by the Zigmunt Pound philosophy, as the tip of a modernity, the coppy, there are increasingly increasing void, and here, now, there are intable spots in a universe in movement, spontaneous from front to the average of the messs that fit them daily.
The phenomenon of the mobile photographs seems the most natural expression way.
A liquid vision that is composed, that is composed.
Moreover, based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What is the only professional photographer left?
And what difference happens between Western photos and conscious photos?
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
Speaking in account of that process of democratization of photography, I started with theera Kodak and arrived at the iPhone.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's orchestra, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
We are trying to be a powerful tool to guide public operation and capture a source of devices and information available to the regions.
This is a picture of Cairo Pensiti, a show that the Folfang Museum of Ess, has dedicated the role of the photographer Mobile.
In the spring spider.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he was liberated from the need to support a political agenda, a lawyer and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalists' priorities.
I've liberated it from the impossible to reach the destination of its own message, if not through traditional channels, messes, information, magazine, daily, cookies, access and limited resources.
And he allows them to put themselves directly into the news department, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
He offered Mega Zenthim in 2012, with the founder of Instagram, founded by an American photography, Research, Courniz, and devoted to conservation of the family heritage of family photography, including photography and society in the 90s.
Or you are born.
We went through healing section, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distributed through iPhone, created by those Italian photographs, Giulio Napolitano and Giorgio Posewick, through a job of scaling in the accent, in narrative, surrounding a theme.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Benjamin Lowi.
Hr. VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Photographic poems that, starting with a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Fidanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and has made a huge drug deal of intimate and minimal narration on the major basketball.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempt and partial Community that returns to his work.
Let's use it daily to build its family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
Going through the Everest African stadium, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African Africa, beyond the media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and on the fame.
We can also be used to start discussing.
There are photographic stereotypes.
As if they were the Luis who interpreted the God's Sea with cellulare, telling in the AI series, one of the most ancient heritage in the West's history.
With the vision of the new world.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who has photographed his successive manifesters in the sink, who is during the protests of Mai-Tan, with an old puzzled bronic, and nowadays, has registered his own cellulating the moment in which the anotor of bronics hits and is born the image, far away and contemporary stream.
Well, what do these photographs know, that we all don't know how to do?
To keep going to the outskirts of the action, or looking for many ideas in the vision of the above.
To learn more than to record.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creativity the code of storytelling, designing in a big and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world's perspective.
And the quality of deep learning.
Because anybody is the pregnant recovery tool.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a coherent manner.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
All of this I believe still makes the difference between a photograph that was a real advantage.
Her bulimic, reproducing, her self-refidential and sharing?
A photography that, in reality, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
[A.DE.]
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
The first one.
It doesn't exist.
So in this room, those actors, these drivers ...
And they add a frequency of 50 Hers.
Then you imagined no, you went home after a really stressful job magazine.
You got your neck with your neck, with your neck, and then I got to bed on your bedshirt.
And I thought I'm on my own.
But no.
There is not always the law.
This frequency of 50 Hert, which I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
(Music) Now.
We have a positive side: Or better, I start before the negative aspect.
This silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive side.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Believe it or not.
And if we look at it, as a design, this frequency of 50/30, isn't more than a soundound, a soundonda with a beautiful rich mirror.
With which you can make music, and then I was controlled.
But why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, or particularly a sound artist, why?
My life was complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
They failed when I was a child.
And I know it, you think this is the classic strappalous story, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in the loneliness ...
During those days, in the burden of that house, I started to play music with everything around you.
I'll tell you?
Each boundary of roots was no longer.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But it invested my musical tool.
(Applause) Of course, every eight-year-old boy wasn't hanging up the biches between his other mom, with a lot of joy between the other than my mom, I have them, I'm staying in the streaming, and this is a great deal.
Of course, I say, at some point...
Everyone will become a normal person, meaning.
So I started studying yesterday.
Little.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to resonate with Clarinetto, the problem was that I really liked Arenzo Arbore, who wrote a personally ambiguous song.
This is how the first years of studio in Genoa came in.
I also gave up the clarity.
It's good then, to not go.
To make illusions of my classmates.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetro sounds in a rumor, and I like to disagree with it.
What's the problem of life?
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the rumor made us grow much more.
I have a smile.
So here's my mission.
Even when there are children, it's about transforming a failure, a rumor.
In music, it is to harmonize everything around me.
I cried?
I'd love poetry, right?
You complain.
I had a great turn of dollar, near Paoli, and everything would be conclusive, but no, I had a hard time in this way my life.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
That's the study, and with the study, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion.
Our inner ears, the colony of bones, our team, reach the massive functional.
return to the fifth week of gestation.
Two hundred times of gestation: this means that we start to listen.
Before talking, we start to listen even before watching.
And this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
I hope that speternity in life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture, mustn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So not in the case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroke Britannic, there's no need to be stupid if the child is once born.
- Yes.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
So?
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else, OK ... (Applause)
But what's the sound?
Well!
That's what they say.
It's all that which we are surrounded, and the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
Boys the son's column every day, the rituals with our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, and not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Well ...
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We know it.
The aim is when we enter the assistant capella, let's say.
It's smaller than how you imagine them.
There's more small, of what, more small, of the Militarian man?
In the small town of San Pietro?
You're in your house, maybe?
It captivates the same thing, as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I encountered a lot of people, and he tells you.
I imagined higher.
Of course, even because it's lower, it would be impossible.
So?
starting from this budget.
The visibility?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try!
Imagine our life, I would like to assume your ability to observe, then we are in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we start to...
To take a picture of the feet, in the wisdom, then the architect, and then another perspective, then it's photo of low, we don't do it, but we also make those, and then there's the purchase, so we use a drone to show us this: "Well, a food blog," - I don't know, it's true, not to eat the dulce, but it's multicational, multisensorial, but it's multimultural, sensory, but it's multimulturally "food" which has a certain point if anyone has a certain point.
"Food, and ...?"
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I'll show you something: when you tie to someone ...
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that between others doesn't exist:way, and ...
Listen.
Fermarvi?
And to listen.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, mocking it ...
It's your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life.
The dream of my life, born ...
What about harassment?
That's it.
For the first time, the school of myself: it was 2013, I wanted to go far away from the adventure, a series of failures, problems and others.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I wrote the plant: yes, it's true.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artistically, it's really far from me.
Shanghai, I decided to participate in a competition, came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to me.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of the whole world, of all cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the city's sidewalks, the cities are a great musical instrument, to allow this musical instrument to get into the city's encouragement.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a sound column.
So, in this moment ...
I want to swallow you.
Shanghai.
(Applause)
In Ivo Manu, a prisoner, they spin that I was a boy from a backyard.
InnibolatÃ£o, the most spheres those who make it ingratinated.
The thing is that it will spray you inside the Madonna.
[Inglese] [Inglese]: I'm going to be a big bite, I'm going to be a big bite.
[Inglese] Iâ€™ve bought the baby monkey, Iâ€™ve bought the baby monkey, Iâ€™ve bought the baby monkey, Iâ€™ve bought the baby monkey, Iâ€™ve bought the baby monkey!
(Laughter)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause) Biovist: Beautiful, wait for Afghanistan.
You were still focused on the visitor.
And this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test.
Wrong them all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography differently, and you've become more than once, but to that smoke, that comes from the tombs, that's coming.
But Brooklyn bridge can resonate?
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
And everything was completely in the leg.
and the desire to swallow, to the upset.
(Music) (Music) (Music)

(Making drum-like sounds using mechanical window) (Ribadagy) (Ribadio) (Ribadagore) (Ribadagore)
(Applause) I went to the counter that I was really hanging on a collapse and something very important to say.
Hello, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because, on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it was another part.
It's magical because under our eyes each day.
Around many of you?
You know a bunch of posts.
In this photo ...
The helpless drop is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captained so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite city, now, take the applause, I'll say - (Applause) That's it!
Remember the first sounds.
And the first songs gave me data of these children, that in this tube ...
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
(Music) And now that is elaborated.
Great breast, well!
(Music)
(Music)
And this is not.
Let's go to the span of ...
(Audience) Grandma.
Yeah!
And I like you a little, it seems like...
So normal, I've never been, I've been attached to this beautiful gap and it has resulted a very low frequency that has become a syntetizer.
[A.DE.]
Am I a means?
He left the lab ... (Music)
OK, Genova is "Mr. Zandis" (Laughter) And I wasn't totally lost, that's one thing would be.
Every time.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Ferrari plaza, it's not just a writer, for me it's a huge musical tool.
And he helped me sustain the bit of this sound column.
It's more or less like that.
(Music) This is a bit like that.
The last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
Look at the bars of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become something like BBA.
The transitors of the sound column.
(Sigh) That's her aircraft.
[What is your life?]
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music) (Music) Alcanta, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium ...
Every time it warms, it breaks.
(Applause)
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
Think about our passions, in my and in your lives.
And how many people will say they're rumors, they're stunned.
For some time, it's really worth it.
It's always worth listening to them, and I thank you for listening, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
As Guy Becky Italian said, the word is often used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in general, the idea of the Ristitution linked to the Monetary Ristitution.
It has the benefit.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And from the part of those who say, "It's nothing to do."
Afterwards in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approached us, so the next 18 minutes shared some aspect of this story.
From the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's paper.
It has a network near Segrate.
And in this same year, my mother Monico organized the money recipe to pay the school.
From the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some people said, "No, why should we help, do we have to think about the common side?"
Most of us do these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
It has collected a billion and 200,000 readings, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro then.
And it was one of the strengths of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similar, the same school as a school in the neighborhood, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
There's the concept of gameback, of reproduction.
It's extremely normal.
So the effort is extraordinary for a manipulation of Italian parents, it's ordinary for the whole of society.
Not that the American space is perfect.
So much more.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've had good fortune, I reappoint.
She likes school.
Through the university, through the museum, along the theaters, there are all the communities that can afford the university benefit.
It's a vision of volunteer.
Not really voluntary, but there's a phenomenon and a positive circle, then there's also...
There were cracks, there were physiological lucidities, there are processes.
The foundation, the society based on this.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker.
He says, "Desistemis Dion is now."
Bravs are trying, a lot.
Initially, they ask, "System is one of the moment."
Obama releases the famous bananachia and has been an incredible technological debt.
The technological advantages haveeso 100 million dollar salts, so not worried about these things are not only happening in Italy.
This sounds are a sound that doesn't work.
A lot of millions of content, and this is the standard response they receive.
In a nutshell, the criteria doesn't end for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticating, and it's enough to be done.
It's easy and normal to start by trying to do and help that is extraordinary.
And if we don't have a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Keeping the technology expectations that were sent by Google and other companies, there are wounds.
And as I agree with the white house, they have architects, marks and walls, they put on their seat, stay, you can be in a few times.
There's one third of the costs.
Many of us would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
What about it?
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting, and that's what...
I want to explain to you about what it was spinning, I hope for people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences that...
They had chosen their lives, experiences that...
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible?
And make them again reproduce and scarce.
And they create a replicable system that is the MIUS of Torris, from this effort that has been born.
A replicable system is what we expect to do as well.
I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, which have been the odds of our lives that have inspired us and have taught us.
Those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, to continue to insist.
Energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years through space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
"When?"
I wanted to do it.
Due order of laughing attracts.
To be or not to do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian guitar is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Twenty years later, we have five to disconnected "materence without Francesco," and the help began to reassure them, to the sensitive need of transformation in general.
Things have knocked us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of the public recording.
She asked me, "Why doesn't it help us water for an year's birthday?"
We thought, we reflected the payment with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my boss, Jeff Besos.
In the brief I decided to apply a methodology of choice, in the detail of a "Don't regret," of the lack of fear, I try to find it and I can't, or I try to not even find it.
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years.
The welcome of...
Oh, Amazon.
But those who do it and love a robot, you don't know how to do it, but those things underwater, these are only many slums, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
I was mentally interpreted to the chooticism and the bureaucracy, people asked me, "But what about this disaster, and I did not expect, obviously?"
Butoscepticism is often about cinism, that gives you a certain mentality.
You won't do it, obviously, you do it because you have teachers, I felt many of this kind.
This country, in truth, lack a lot of sense of common good.
And it's doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interesting.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner.
To the elderly, you recognize it, such as my serious or megrees, I say this because it's the huge title, my children, have imprisoned me at the beginning of an extraordinary commissionery, and simply because it's their path that allowed me to assume people on the foots of the public record.
And of course, the only thing I asked you is.
It's like the systems from the inside, it's not transformed, right?
We want to try to transform them with people who are out there, where the fact of not knowing the public administration.
It's a sign.
And not a reliability, it's an advantage and an advantage.
So, of course, we created a small team, I wanted a small team, you've said 25 people, a number.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations around 80 percent, 20% are expected to make judges, legal ones.
Doctors of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write?"
What I think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
Surther times there is a compassion, likely, much less than what you see.
How do I keep you?
So I got into the idea, but how can I invite someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photographer in Bella's mind that in the 1947 she caught all the United States, who had given her phone children, all the United States, in this sport, a massive business.
I need infrastructure investments.
We created the vision.
The country's operational system, a series of fundamental components that build more simple, efficient for citizens, public management and companies.
Through innovative digital products.
The vision of beauty, the introduction, is decrime and blood.
I've continued my postcard in salt, but it's the American future, if I equivocate it.
And I continued, we will also find many complicated rules, such an incompensible photovoltaic, it's an easy prediction.
We must learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many will say, "Don't understand how public administration works."
They've already told us many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
What follows?
We will criticize a lot: some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and prejudice.
The criteria of the first group will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and there are many treatments.
The one in the second type, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the bicycle as a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Do you remember this picture: the first, the men and women in the Times magazine cover?
Here's it.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible people to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of those surely, at least one hundred them decisively qualified, we've used digital tourists for collochi, an app that's called Jazz, we've put it in Beth in the edge of the Govern.
We did a math test, a mathematical test, a technological part.
The team had completed the critical mass nearby, so there are seven geniuses, now we are a little more turned into, and he immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter)
In fact, we deal with "draulics."
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect because it's a big problem.
Why?
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected.
It's silent and doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their own suffering, their own applications.
So it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it.
And in years to implement it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
Then there are software, of course, and doing so many activities for management.
So many legal activities ...
We can't just smell.
To make the games of the stag, in time, you have to make them better, interact with the thirst, selling more basic things.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your thesis you can't do the right.
After a few months, at the July of 2017 we said, "The piano, listen to public recording, we did together with other people who helped us."
What is mainly the trendal piano for digital transformation in my stake?
In order to explain there is one thing, there is.
Right?
It's written in a clear way.
Nolody?
But also in the process.
The first time it was...
It has been assessed and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole has frightened the decrease of the present that it is minister, the digital dissonation is a state priority, the formal piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public management, the life of the citizens, particularly the piano.
It has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, and especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
What is this, the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
According to the recovery of the technological rules and the rules, there are probably three pains of visibility and connections to other norms in other regulations, and at some point there are the technological rules that are quite dark.
Unfortunately, we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things.
So, the Triennale piano.
I'messoing on your technological skills, you understand it.
It has brought its shape, where we can.
Talking to administrators, making us give feedback, documentary about reddox, so that the administrators themselves, the technological leadership of software.
Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always the part of the piano.
At the population platforms, these are the militant platforms, they are the digital payments, they are the things that abilitate in spontaneously all the public administration public activities, and even more there will be.
The digital payment is one: a digital payment, a electronic card, an interactive sign, a trap.
Digital identity is a retirement platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
Metteresto, technologically, all the data of your citizens that at this time are around 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only database.
Out of the data they talk about, they are all synchronized.
And they talk to the rest of the administration applications: when I get through one common to another.
It's true.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago and a week ago we made an Akaton.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that application of activists, they have been used in 96 interventions.
Bag-fixing, therefore, putting up on software problems, improving the documentation, and even new projects.
It was created in 25 Italian cities.
In San Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from a technological point of view, from the European.
All of this?
Does it influence?
We're talking about sustainability, replicity and scalability in the void of true action for Italy.T, where they're wovened, all documentary, and all the code, but more and more, the applications.
In the Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that officially...
They're not limited to do an iraulic, they also enter the ball.
But it serves that the tablets are composed, let me disappoint this, this might be, for example.
And it's one of those things that would have to do.
When we'll launch Alsa version, Alfa, it's called digital citizenship.
Do you have a phone?
This is the smartphone.
You gave the digital identity card, you gave the electronic identity card to Nepsi.
Is it already functional?
And all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction between citizens and public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because working on this job we truly do it, but it's different in this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
With the next 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it.
We wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rules and not the acceptance.
A country in which they read and recognize and promote the right to innovate, to prevent building it.
A country wants to offer technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public administration is an wealth: where the best humans do better to work in public research centers, that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation.
They lead development to the country.
That's how I have a dream.
And what the components to do all this process policies?
Technical data are really many and maybe many.
But if I don't have a dream about which we can hardly be able to do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
(Audience) Yes!
And here, somewhere in this theater, between the other.
But at this point, it's easier, and not if you've managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like the slums, like the 25 kids of digital transformation, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want.
Sare.
(Laughter)
"Yes."
Wow!
(Pierre Jean-Pierre Bacri) (nglese) [Inglese] Well!
What if you wanted information about us?
Our dream and our social issues, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
Just one to change a aspect of your life?
That it's not going to be passed.
What would you change?
What would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your boss and your employees?
You're scared, they're keeping you, it's for that, right?
Because here comes in, I know there is.
Then, raise your hand those who would change something about your body, maybe lose some thread.
Magari would win their muscles.
Well, here's a bit more, there's more freedom.
Please raise your hand if you'd change the corriente, it's better if you want.
I was sure everyone would be over there.
You may be one of those who will change partner.
(Audience) Yes!
Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if I'm part of it.
And the answer was different, because elementary schools would have more united family.
My parents weren't separated.
I would have returned to my fears more beautiful.
I'd like to love more to the kids.
On the twice, I felt the most complex professors, they seemed to me all excited.
And I reflected in music, here.
I grew up vooto to be in the test.
I would have wanted to work at university, but I found the difficulty of accessing the job market.
So, the first part of my life, I went through fighting and lotting, to try to understand how to change things that didn't belong to me ...
What did the others think of me?
The biggest economical fever of interpersonal relationships.
It has some characteristics I have acquired the end of birth.
When am I a psychologist?
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefits, but as well as most of the cases are happening.
There were only three card cards playing in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up maintaining their problems in life.
Nowadays, the strategy is more broadcast.
Well?
Sleeping.
But let's remember a little bit about it.
There's crisis, there's no job, there's traffic, frÃ­o, that I'd have done differently.
We feel sorry because there is no justice.
I know many people who go to the table.
And the problem is that if you design mental space, this paralyzes you.
Typnotizza and algae.
I was buying homeland.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, who wasn't doing anything else to get bothered, from when I started to talk, to when I stopped to return home.
She started lamenting the triumphy, that she left her, and then the girl with whom she shared her.
So from the fact that he didn't have a job, the ultimate government national ship that didn't help him, felt that he had value, abilities, and here he was the mind.
She had completely colonized all her daily life.
So, I'm sorry.
It's a bit like the big attempt.
Because with a small effort ...
We had to obtain a great result.
Reaching the victim's hell?
That is listened, comforted, helped.
But beware.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
From loneliness or friends?
To a low voice?
Or in your mind.
You can liep yourself of something already happened, or of something that maybe one day could happen?
You can lie to your tea, or how much more often it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you're forced to disappoint you hardly have something around you.
It will change, older, there's no other way to pay more attention to what hurts you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as adults, is that of lamenting.
Suppose that someone is at the studio of a B piano?
This is saving your hair.
Just to the magnifying glass.
Another very excited strategy, when things are constantly stretching, is that of impact.
Importing our need.
(Laughter) Through this mentality, there is a growing cultural factor based on which we learned that if something doesn't work.
It's enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being.
What surrounds us.
Doesn't you like ice cream?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
(Laughter) You felt a bit dirty, but why could you never be suffering?
I took two pillars and solved it easy.
The wife breaks you?
Divority.
Even fresh, let's take a look at how many risks are at hand.
I don't listen to you, let me tell you.
And too big, we couldn't mention it, send it to the opposite: we are here for this, on the other hand.
My vocation, my choice for this, this profession.
To make the world around you fly at the perfection.
What about your demands?
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, is...
The relationships of coppy.
Let's remember one, a coppy.
Well, during the lectures I didn't do anything else, that listening to what, according to one, the other had to change to take risks.
Safness of their future.
He is.
Well, it's certain that it's to conceive you, but it's not even to prepare yourself in a grade.
If it runs.
And the law, right?
"You've never asked me if not for that."
And he didn't.
You don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do something else to get me uncontrol, and this way through the infinitely a strong iron-longing arm.
It always starts with the same stretch word.
And because we need to show all the line of equity of others, we need to make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
[The public sends a bathroom]
But the truth is that if this thing we say it often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old.
Instead of removing the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them.
What if the strategy of privilege?
When things don't leave as you wish, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result.
And we thought about a couple of times, because you'll have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that we don't like is...
To make it so that there are no, like a tool, to take the forehead, to put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the aim of facing the conflict emerging.
The love we should show our needs.
So what do we do, do we suffer them for the common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the merce of altruistic needs.
AC: I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, who had learned how to deal with a great diploma between the kids of mum and dads.
I hope to spell on the moon that as soon as you were confronted with someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation.
It taught important things, for example, it learned.
To listen.
To accept, to rag their motivations, even distant from one another, but on the other, I never learned to say no.
Something they didn't care about.
To say no to the relationships that were looking for it, there was any social condition, and old one of the ones that would always be mediated, but in this way.
They were sending them to finish their needs, their wishes and their ambitions, they were always under the fear of facing the confinement.
It's the need to count all how many.
It's the strategy that privileges when things are not as wisdom.
Is it that of suffering your needs?
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead to count all how many.
So I'll start to disrupt them.
It's what I want to do, sorry.
To integrate your needs, or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause-function, because I myself in a long time, in the doctor's meditation, has abused.
I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school for which I was working sent me to call me and said, "Boh."
Please calm, here, for her, there's no room left.
If you like to continue collapse with us, you must accept a disorder.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most, or if everything had to go there to do a job that neither there was a big deal with all that I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to regret me.
Trying to make them change ideas, adoptors, but I sent that other.
And even better, why would I never have accepted a commitment?
That for me was unbeatable.
I learned that...
But having different results I'd have to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my hair, at that moment ...
I understood the secret...
How can we change others?
It's changing yourself.
If it had changed me?
Also, the others would have to follow, change, change.
If it was a psychologist that was really brilliant, competent, complete, one, the primary school wouldn't have sent me a way.
If I had done that, the thing wouldn't harm me more than that, but perhaps I would have gone away before than Olymica Chias.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
The answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Thresponsability.
Why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It comes to the instruction of choosing.
Tell them about you.
What's the cause of things?
that they don't leave as a path.
Receive yourself as a cause of things that are not going to happen.
This is our challenge.
If you haven't ever had a job at the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
Now I'll be alone and helpful, confronting something too big and I'd like to say, "The crisis championship, what do you want to do?"
But if it's time to go to the land, and you think it's perfect, that maybe you've had a bank of change.
And then get better, then you open your doors in front of you, because it spreads your responsibility, the gang, you can always decide to speak a new language.
Leaving books, visiting courses to acquire new skills, consolidating those you've already had.
Then working on yourself to become a doctor.
Because life is the one who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
If inside the coppy, things don't go well, you think it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It's sending them a message of inadequity and I'm spreading it.
If you're part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
Then, things?
Change.
They don't change the case, but they change because you know you've changed it.
First, I was looking for his obsession.
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate.
to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war.
That's not the case.
I know one of those people.
It's with everyone, that always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me leave the term: prostitute and relaxation.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose meaning and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them.
Then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a guitar standard.
And starting to work on myself, considering myself the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, but their simple effect is to start working on me.
That I also started to warn that I was a better person.
When I was writing to the university I had a dream.
The dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my matter.
There were practical and concrete tools sometimes even for free.
To bring great value inside their lives.
But, friends, I met a couple of...
What about the problem?
Stereotipi, prejuicios, obscologism is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but it will talk to a friend, but it goes to the barbecue.
But what would I have to do?
Have you seen me lamenting or possible that you don't explain how much good psychology is?
I had to try to change their mental priorities, I had to give up my dream.
No, I had to.
To learn how to speak a language that was not happening, as closer to people, I had to learn how to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs?
Instead?
Imports mine.
It's the turn of...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results for me.
In the impossible.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transferment, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights.
And I believe what to do?
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here by the hilly lady, I say to get along with her anxiety.
Maybe you think it's.
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels were a reference point in Italy, for what video psychology is, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people.
And psychology comes in discussing some of the stereotypes that I've just told you about.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 1979, published psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best editors, in Italy, was my house.
And what dropped me more than anything.
It was recognized that the bathrooms initially fled a bit strange.
So I decided to leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbians have been read to the president.
What are the dreams?
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The story you have to have is that which you can hold and make progress, those who don't know how to build and need to discuss.
What should be done.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your two certainties, your bones of always.
If there's something I've learned from all that, my journey improves.
It's that the most important transition.
Maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For many reasons, I've asked you a question.
They say "Yes."
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life, that doesn't come true.
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
Well, I'd like to leave you with a gift, how much less you prove.
It's a small question that was very useful to me personally.
And that it's based on the logic that in order to produce big changes we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put it on.
Your life in the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the direct?
It's an ambite.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
And that's it.
"Ah, did you look at the freezer, what or how did you eat?"
The ugly to asso, left the pullman, right?
Where do I put the packs?
The martial idea is the proves.
I made my hands, I knocked my leg.
In its feet, it's now to change.
"Offiti" was when my mother came.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
with diverse and different abilities.
percussions are so fast.
So immediate.
They take the distances and join the battles.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
Seven young people.
I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
Dany it.
I saw him growing.
Our provides were the sea.
The Friday was the day to provide.
Have you ever entered this?
Studying at the Andreoli music school.
They were picking the first bidonies.
It was together.
The first one deserves together.
Then we decided to become part of the band.
From there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical sights and we saw the first ones, the first weddings in the butterflies.
The first satisfaction, the first ones.
Interesting?
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately ...
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we stayed ...
The earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
In the end, every Martians was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
Io, Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo.
We've all focused on you.
Nelete Alopoli and the rocks.
Have we done it?
Luckily, we all found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manifes, of military purposes.
Within that tender?
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because reading a book makes them stronger than the earthquake.
She looked at us in the eye.
With the Earth shaking?
To search...
A smile.
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubes that became...
That the tools built and combined with ping pong roots.
The songs with big and brothers.
Cross.
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
That's where our first spettacol was born.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to speak.
From 20 years from now, we became 25-30-40.
50?
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards.
We did.
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also have a moment of our land.
to breathe for a moment.
A year later we've cracked, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea is from the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender.
And no one of us would have ever thought it's a stone?
It could change our lives.
But?
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are coming to me?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first master?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
And the kindergarten stage?
We haven't really done so many.
And also for me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly me.
It's exactly the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also...
of freshness.
That there are so many possibilities in the future.
That's it.
What happens when a dream?
Really.
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
What is there still so much?
to build.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
Audience: Yes!
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause) One, two, stage fright.
Radini.
Theultina'sultina.
250 years very important.
So they completely changed our history.
And that we live now.
Do we talk about social innovation?
And my question is, what is this innovation on?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often so biased.
It's a ready country.
Adding these digital innovations and ready to be adapted around innovation.
I used the digital flash, we all carry it.
I idly, near us, I believe almost everyone.
In fact, it adds up an evolution that was extraordinary to precisely attracted these 250 years.
The phone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
It's a computer, it's extremely evolving.
And the computer belongs, indeed.
The revolution is the Internet, it's known, and once again this is an invention of the Internet revolution, of the phases, our history.
Or?
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era.
And we have, somehow, storically beatened arbitrously in the 2000s that we are living today.
Let's try to understand, then, what has happened in these three?
In these 250 years, they biased...
The industrial revolution, the revolution and the Internet, and the Internet.
The Industrial Revolution, when we listen to it, we probably remember it as an iron.
Is it what we've studied?
I didn't have any school book.
Actually, it wasn't only an iron.
We, at the Industrial Revolution, we are huge meritors.
It's an enormous debate, for example, because we have the vapore's motorcycle.
The winning motor isn't just a winning motor, but that's, for example, the tool.
It has favored, and it has become much faster, carbon stations.
And the risks possible is an increasingly lower cost.
Then the vapore motorbike entered the cordificialities, entered the belts, and began to change the modalities, but he didn't make it.
We don't only need the motorcycle.
Wow, should we also do them?
The scoppy motorcycle.
The motorascope, because it's also a Toscanican invention, it's an Italian invention.
What about motorcycle?
No, no.
We have, for example, the automobility industry.
Actually, it was the usual industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motor that could not go from far away when I was able to understand.
It was an internal fuel bottle when I couldn't understand how to wake up that belt, to turn it into the verb, and welcomed with the seed that has developed.
The automobility industry is all that has been taught.
But they are not.
At the Industrial Revolution, we still have debates, for example, on the phone.
The phone isn't only with the tool that permits us ...
To keep reviewing our letters and that has rapidly modified the migration of these letters from one part to another of the world as much as we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us and has taught us.
the deposits of caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because after the phone, we could try it in the sea.
So what did we do?
Let's interrupt everything.
We've been making caves under the sea.
The first cavity, to dare a storic dimension, was taken in Italy between Mexico and articulated abbia.
Not exactly two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave stayed there.
And we're around 1858.
That's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
The continuous one, in Europe, was built by Santa Radagonda, where the Rinascente Milano is.
Today, there is the scent line: a while in 1873 is built the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
A part of our history has swimmed from there.
Let's move forward, let's go a bit late, and we arrived at 1950 of this, it's already grown, and it's getting to know a certain act, which has been a seventh ...
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important staggering and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point.
It started to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the first history.
I'm the computer, I'm the calculators.
Teachers who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stance like this, and had functions of mixture.
They simply looked faster with the calculation.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the internet revolution something else happened.
There were research studies, and above all, there were scopes.
From tubes, of defense, that have led us to develop landmares, but they don't know how to take them all over the land, but endless, because they weren't known.
At some point, he decided to open these responses.
These rots called ARPA, ARPANET, the network.
They became and began to be the World Web that we know.
A system that is broadcast, horizontal, non-archical, extremely captured, is able to bring information, to collect information and generate information.
To give you an idea, in 1981 only 300 computers connected to the Internet.
In 1995, there were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the minds of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that connect to the network.
To take care of data, to collect data, or to work on data.
But when does the power function?
Because it was supposed to say a substitute.
Think about the Industrial Revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
"Yeah!"
The Internet had the ocean that if we little began to live the horizon we lived now.
What are we living now?
It's what's called "Indassia the Internet," and this is a phenomenon of "creating distraction," of creative destruction.
It's an industrial process that tells us that what's new gradually distruits what's old because it needs to make space.
And we'll see better then.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions.
But there's a story that is a bit more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which it generates a reflection.
I have to accompany you.
When, little by little, I haven't done the Italians yet, for 1863.
Mister Minghetti, finances in Inghetti.
It accounts that 27th of the month of law is correct, the payment is publicly dependent.
And from 27 of the successive resources, this happened.
In this moment, even if we don't explain it, we're introducing my struming sites, I'm introducing something extraordinary.
First, the richness of a family, more than a singer.
It wasn't in its capacity to produce goods that were necessary in its own surroundings.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation.
It started, somehow, to move away from the earth.
And most of all,
It has transformed the economic power of power of production.
of benefits and benefits in the power of producing one.
Well, the denaro.
But there is a second aspect.
What do you prefer?
For us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has sufficiently read us.
But what effectively was the frigerator?
It's not only that goal that will free us from the urge to go and sponsor every day.
But it's also this industrial system that allows us to preserve.
In a massive way, a structured way healthy.
In large quantity of food?
So?
There is still the chance, once again.
To concentrate on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of everyday life.
This is the man who begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
In recently, how did we say?
The computer arrived and arrived the internet, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, which is an element.
What we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, were not as fast as we are today.
Today we do things very fast, we move at speed.
The speed of the rings, the speed of movement, the speed of our movement.
And also the speed of our thinking that it's not in detail of the thought.
We are not very fast.
But something happened.
It's almost close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date.
That it's not necessarily zero or zero.
1900, it's 2000.
When can we say that the 20th century has finished?
I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that really does.
The segment is the passing of an orchor from a background in 2001 and 2008.
They say "N", why?
First of all.
The American economy started to slow down.
And there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance began to change, these balanced that seemed lonely, we were correct to be very fragile.
But we move forward until something happened, normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world, would never meet.
There's no only Americ, it must rally up, almost closed.
There was also the Orient.
There were Europeans who were to fail.
The police already had money for failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there.
I changed something.
But what has changed has changed the economical paradigm, couldn't we?
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis.
In fact, if it was verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think about it.
But how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would be left.
We were the ones who didn't know it.
Look at them, look at them.
These companies...
These are renewable multinationals, in most of them, but above all, they are all the ones left after 2011.
What did these companies do, don't they innovate?
They were inventing something, they had never been able to build something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done.
Compring, selling, traveling, learning.
Remember.
The diverse way.
in a more efficient way.
And what about us?
It's so often denied.
We tried to look at the health state of digital tales, according to five factors: connectivity.
We are ten percentage under the average.
Ironisticly.
We are almost close to a fast connection between 50%.
It's so, it's little.
Anything already, according to human abilities of human resources, the ability to heal, to a distant being between advanced and competences based on what allows us to flow.
The IT systems of digital systems.
What move forward is those that allow us to develop them.
A third factory that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, a horn.
The industrialization of products and services.
The fifth is digitalization.
The public administration system: we immediately follow the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the enemies of the important ones.
Also, a good news for everyone: all five elements are growing.
Five elements that are growing, at a speed of growth completely athetic until two years ago.
We're lineing the European countries, and this is a good news.
On the other hand, connectivity, we said it, 11 points out.
But, objectively, it's enough to look at the newspapers and see that...
We are growing fast.
A very important competition, the use of the Internet, frankly, we are really a few seconds.
Actually, a very profound change has been brought to the European standards.
There are two factors that we should look at with great attention, that will be key for our future of countries.
They are the abilities and the inclusion of digital in brutal factors.
In this way we have to be very careful about the characteristics of our country.
We have two engines.
The first motorbike?
It's what happened most in the 50s, and it's the pictures made by the media.
Longe from being, the small printed media.
Something that isn't useful, it's not necessary.
In fact, it's not necessary for large internationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
They are doing something extraordinary, Made in Italy, they have a quality and eccellence in the production of service in products, in the production of products.
It's quite united in their position, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to insistently acquire abilities within these reality.
Because these realities can become as credible as the "Times Fenancial Times."
I mean those multinationals that can help.
A segmented interaction.
The market, extraordinaryly, generating ricks for all the thesis.
It's around us, and this is the first plate we have, the first big motorcycle: the second motorcycle that has the child.
And its cultural artistic heritage.
A heritage that a human nature, for its existential nature, thanks to Dio, is an analytical heritage, and it remains an analogical heritage, we can't digitalize homes.
How can it be?
Because tourists live not only three cities.
Venezuela, USA, and then they repeat.
But the ricks of these three cities don't do it.
The richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've had the chance to start, but we're speed to recover.
To enjoy it.
This heritage.
Within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it away and to make it black, and to bring the tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our country.
I believe that this is the biggest asset we can.
Fare is our Italy.
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause) The topic that I'll talk about in a certain sense is...
The opposite of the word "action."
What to unify?
Good afternoon.
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
I opened my hair.
According to you, in the past...
15, 20 years.
We said in the 21st century.
In the world, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens are increased or are diminished.
But I believe that most of you would answer:
I'm increased, if you go to journalists, maybe you'll agree.
The active, the preziamolo.
They are increased exponentially.
It's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be.
It's also.
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the results of video.
I'm prepared with my colleagues, a rappor.
We know about inequalities, from when we are data, that is, fundamentally, from 1960.
For the vast majority of countries in the world.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
By the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated now we're at the storic mining.
And in Italy?
In Italy, the victims of inequality are quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
We have a tendency to disguise in decrescent.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible letture is to say: we've buried a complete alcohol, because we've continued to talk about years of increase in inequality as much as it seems.
The data doesn't support our senses.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality?
That many of us, myself ...
Let's move?
Yeah!
The feeling wasn't wrong.
But maybe the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Can you imagine that?
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality, what do we understand?
For inequality.
Maybe the reason of inequality?
It requires some rhythm.
Do you want to do that?
Temporaryly to answer this question.
And let's move around a century.
And also somewhere: let's move.
It's imbric in 1928.
One year before the big crisis of 29: Lickens.
That was Cambridge, a speech came out in front of me.
There's a group of students, a speech was then famous with the title "posibility economical" for our grandchildren.
At that time, Keynes forms two profiles.
The first one says.
It was a seventh, the product.
I was working for an hour.
That's it.
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this exchange, indeed, is realised, because if you're about to engage.
Refugements of the storage of the economy?
Effectively, in most society, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years, as well.
We thought, twelve times, in some cases 15 times, so this profile was realised, but from this profile Keynes also riches.
A consequence, an idea, that is, humanity ...
Little by little.
That is, it's done to say, little to 100 years, it would be found with a huge amount.
The free time that would have gone to it...
Lavoring less?
She also said to her to work all, and when she told her that she wanted much less, she wanted to.
A 15-month week of work?
I have an orary.
With three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
Well, well?
Apparently, this second trust didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
But me ...
I'll be able to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says that we'll all live, it's certainly false.
But the first part...
We will remember much less, we will work three hours a day.
Are we certain that it isn't?
We removed from anywhere, we went to see those successes in Italy.
This one...
The curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
It determines work throughout your life.
Your life, naturally, potentially working, meaning for 15 years, then ...
We are ...
In terms of doing a job, let's do it if we keep this committee ...
The teacher of Keynes, in reality, has been achieved.
Why did we know at the beginning of 1990, almost 40% of the time of our lives?
to work?
And now?
We call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
Let's do it?
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Naturally...
If this has happened, there are reasons too.
Ovi and if you wanted a banal.
For example, the elderly is highly burned.
Because we die a lot after life expectancy.
Who's grown up in something like 27 years old?
From the beginning of the year century, from 19900.
There's another very positive reason, and other bananas, if you want.
Our children often study, often study a long time.
We've also been studying for 25 and 30 years, so young people are launched.
But there is a reason, maybe more fundamental, why?
Our quote of time?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And that's it.
The trafficking rate, that is, the number of people.
Why was it?
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion.
And this series of dramatic stories, because it makes you see.
In the beginning of the seventh, in the whole monarchical ocean.
First of the Second World War, the occupation rate was even more.
I hope it's more than 70%.
Today?
We are very low, around 50 percent scary, old.
From 1968 one year.
The occupation rate has always been lower than 50%.
Then, what about a pile of occupation?
It includes 50 percent.
What does that mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income.
They are more.
Me, a worker.
In front of this?
Fattoos.
It's storic.
We can also have a reaction.
It's enthusiastic and says, "But this?
And beauty progress.
It's modernity.
Things have been like this, because we can let it happen.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States.
And then we see the confront.
Thank you.
In Italy.
It was united.
This is the storic series of time.
It has dedicated the work in life, as you can see, and the United States is on its own.
In the '30s, then it's established, because there's a third tendency to the argument while we come from.
But even more impressive is the storic number of the occupation rate.
Because here we see.
What's left there?
There is an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29.
But after the crisis of 29th, we have a general trend of the occupation rate in the United States.
Now, in our case, we have one.
Situation?
Riduation.
the occupation taste.
But then that?
Education is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
There are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of people ...
I was in a sentence that I defined.
Hi?
Dipendence in parassity, in addition, because depending on the website in your Wiss.
This can also be a family member, the State.
But would it stop, why do I use it?
I have the available income without working.
I'm a friend who does it?
The theater act.
When did I find these results?
We were at the scene and I asked them.
How did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parassitary dependence?
And he do you know what answered me?
With Epopowerus and that aluminum ...
It's on the backs of Epoto, but it's called buffago, some say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves?
The buffag, or the buffaca on the hypothms, or on other great mammals, these whales also live on the roots, on the buffs, we have this film.
Why will it be there for some seconds in which you see?
- Yes.
The animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
Bypassing our resources.
Why?
The buffler supplies that they're insetti.
The ze tree that everything that host on the golden dorship is not clear.
If the hairdresser is happy or not, the eye that enters can mean or is he playing.
It's an idea that is infastated from theelline.
Anyone.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not an etologist.
So, sociologists, the question that I asked myself as a sociologist.
Another thing is how can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers?
It's a minority.
So the producers.
How do we define a society in which ...
There is this kind of improductive consumption that I've been told before, but is this the signal society?
Society, signals, like fedal society in which there is blindness.
What's in the sentence?
to live without working.
But naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
This is indeed a conviction.
What can be defined?
In a signorious society, but a society that's useless.
"Yeah."
Because consumers are more than producers.
In the signorious, simple, classic society, we have the sign and the serves of the grey that they produce for them.
In society.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission in a massive society.
Things are a bit more complicated: ladies, I've become many.
Well!
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated.
Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, would define a relationship of damages, let's see why, mumps.
The relationship?
The buffer with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food it's there.
It's on the backs of the hypothomo.
There's indigenous faces one.
It's an advantage.
And also from the view of the producers, we came back to a green light, a green light, the Epopopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need a buffaco.
But in some way, it's a lack of obligation, how are we?
We have faces of color that we keep.
Because we can't, we can't epowerpower, we can't nourish the killings that live.
South spallets.
So the situation is very complicated, and this is a situation of interaction, it's a situation.
That it's not okay.
Is it a situation?
What about the project?
"C."
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
Today, maybe the only inequality to the question I had made talking about Keynes.
And the inequality of access to work.
Access to work is very essential in our social system, but if inequality ...
And access to work we can use the tools.
It's the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent concentration of horses, which is the tool with which ...
In terms of inequality, we can apply it to work, there are people who don't work, who have middle of work, who have one job that has two jobs.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic.
And it's scared.
In the last week, in the towel, together?
"So, Turchia?"
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we will probably be the palm of this graduator, the best situation, that of a Norway.
With the United States messes in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
The pelled inequality of access to work in Italy is always measured with the efficient decent, and you can see something pleasant, that inequality is the worst during monarchical age, particularly under the fascism.
And it's huge in public schools particularly under the second Republic Republic.
It's the one we live in.
There are 7 million work positions left if we had 7 million more jobs, our families.
You would accept it.
Million euro per month, and in addition, there were around 12,000 euro per month.
The year.
And our state would have 15 billion euros as much as health and school put together, more or less in Italy.
I said, "Come?
Who's finished?
But...
What?
We've got the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution: "School is a democratic republic based on work."
We are the only country.
Because it has this in the first articulum of the Constitution, and we are the best country together with Turkey.
It's the West.
That's why.
We change things.
And we believe.
The seven million jobs that are missing?
Or maybe it's better to download the article one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a beer.
Thank you. (Applause)
