(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently far away: Be, you must know that until some time my two pictures are missing.
Better raised.
Mars and Francesca.
And, in addition, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolate?
From a terrible incarctation.
The words were tired to get out of there, they stayed...
Put yourself in your mouth.
Over the years, the child becomes a boy.
But we suffer a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, psychologists, all brave people, a lot of professionals, but nobody can do it.
To take this incarct.
One day, I traveled to Roma.
And so, just for pure fortune?
Take a look at a little girl.
His name was Teresa.
Equestion.
And this little girl says.
Give a break.
When?
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around you said "Mrs. Teresa," but what beautiful words of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the forest of his country, they were celebrating a big party with a birthplace.
And a microphone, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a buzz.
But the desire of this young man, of feeling the battles we had written, the comic fights were too big, and he didn't think about it.
He left for free of the surgeon, took the seventh microphone, and everybody went out, I was a computer engineer, think I was so brave in the internet than my first words just before were: web, web!
That's how it works.
People were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That young man ...
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me and would have said, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mother would say.
But the power runs us.
But first, I have to tell you something very important: why when I spoke about my disability, my debility?
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What is a moment?
I talk about my disappointments and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me: finding a disability, you can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read it.
Trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They're the words of the little soccer room.
Tumbia Frey.
Not to be afraid.
But the father's glass is my wife.
She says, "Yes, puzzled, dotted, but our son is a mask and a female."
(Laughter)
The doctor says, "Scuse, sign, maybe she didn't understand, and trisomy 21."
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is."
Is it a mask or an end?
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "But pupa, misery, we don't even know what we were able to do the NELA mask, but it's dark."
And the dot has given the alarm to the dot, because ... (Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause) We can talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult of our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superhero.
Anyone.
A few months ago.
(Applause) A marvellous one is beautiful and also strong admit that mine is a slightly biased, you've understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
Now this is not the potential.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, analysis, we know everything, but a few.
Many of these people had encountered people.
So, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Second Anna".
Like this, without predicting too much serious, but not at all, older people.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know from one, as you go to school." "Let's look at the good news that bring us, for example, a little while ago Francesca came home," saying, "You know, here?
Or another one, where she says, "But it's true that you suffer from Down syndrome and you don't give birth to blue eyes," "Bella, this is said with Down syndrome," because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in more, I don't know.
I'll give you an example: do you present TED?
You built a small X.
(Applause) No, because I'll give you this example, because today, to know TED, to talk to people, you've made a bit of fat, so the invitation is to make a little bit of fatal and don't prevent the encounters of disability that will be in your life as personal, but also some people around you, a very small advertisement.
In this path, we can lose.
Because our tendency is always the one to give us: a grader survive!
Or a free one.
Well, to wake up the eyes you have to put them at the same level.
And in this sense, it captivates me many times of losing: that's why I like a politician to leave bricks along my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon.
With this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you.
To try to trace disabilities.
In your life.
To clarify it.
And most importantly.
Remember?
The pause.
What can you look at the face?
They become brave.
Thank you very much.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who sees or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And I understood which was my mission in the world: actually, it wasn't born for a bunch of birds, nor for a romantic disorder, as they remembered some speakers before, but for an orchestra.
She didn't go well, she could go further, because she was thanks to a traffic.
So I think I'm very fortunate, maybe many of you are chosen while you were spinning ants?
To make you realize how scary it scares every day, of how much scarc percentual it has happened to me, it's what has happened to me one night because of a traffic, and this thing has opened my mind, has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment I decided that what I had done, what would be my mission in the world.
It seems there would be nothing left to be drawn.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's the reason we can decide, for us, for our family, every single day.
And not only, therefore, it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact.
Because our daily nutritional choices are a large part of our daily environmental impact.
Let's try it with an index where we could talk, for example, about ecological pressure.
And it increases much more what we choose to ordinary the opponent, that maybe the way we dress or how we move to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be.
If nothing else is perfectly aware of the choices they make each day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
And it's optimizing.
I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied.
At every day's life, especially at what's our informe with food, using means, for example, the way we use our defense.
It's how we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
And then, obviously, to try to use 100% of the raw materials.
Mr.M.
Another thing of consumption is to optimize consumers.
And above all, also the way we make the interact every day.
So, what are we, indeed, carrying on a table?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the trafficking of the lines, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example of...
I look at the first nobilities: we're used to doing what I'm doing now every day at home, when we pull the vegetables.
And to separate from one part, there is the noble part that we use and on the one hand, there is the scary.
I'm scared, so the less noble part.
In average, it's approximately 50% in winter, and up to 70% of the size of so many green.
They took more protected parts.
So what does it mean to optimize in the kitchen means to simply recover these things?
That's about being rejected, that means having a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joint together.
Let's take an example with mine.
I can see her with me.
Okay, a window.
But I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also cost such an natural cake.
I looked for it.
Surely, I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm wearing a rigorous, fantastic thesis, that you buy in Boristeria, it probably cost my torso much more.
The social traffic and I lasts ferment, so the sugar, naturally, becomes an acceptance, a great act of meal, because I accept that we can also do from the tubes, and the seeds I can give them as a refrigerator.
The busy is the veracity of the nobility, it's where the conviction of fiber concentrates.
It's less than the dust, because maybe you don't like the dust too much, you can concentrate on the bus, and it's also the part that has more fibers, so a benefit certainly for health, but not only with all internal statements I can prepare a cell, the seeds.
Can I tolerate them or simply make them manage?
And to manage something I think is a practical example.
It's a very easy technology, but it allows us to transform, also to value.
Something that we all have at home and that we usually don't stop looking at and traveling.
So optimize in the pool for me, especially this: changing a little bit your mentality and seeing with a different eye.
particularly the ants, but all the food.
To spreh them less and appreciate them to massimo.
To optimize is also optimize consumers of energy heater, for example.
And many times here, there is too much or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, water there are other things.
Worms are enough to have a box, it's not that suits the idea, or sometimes with an appliance like the vast.
It's also used to know, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that some of you are shooting the gear, but it's a very high spoon technique, the bass temperature, so it doesn't happen that you can use a professional instrument for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use the vast, all the time you're wearing, as you do.
A very practical example.
Take a glass like this, it must be your hermetic therapist.
For example, let's take a new step together with the water and enjoy it.
And you repeat it to the mix of the golden broke, so the warning must not be full, full of catisports like always, and then you know the clothes you prefer, you choose at the base of the anchoring of the pieces, and vice versa, when the cow finds up your eggs will be fantastic because it will be next to a low temperature.
And in addition to obtain a result that would hardly obtain with traditional technology.
So ...
To optimize the use of domestic adaptation I think can give beneficial interests.
Another application of optimizing this time to theattoo, I even entered your home in your home: But when we were in war, OK?
There was a lot of food.
We had a few proteins, they earned a lot of patates, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the cake, for example, the candles.
The protectiveatti was a party, and it was like this: now the problem is opposite, we have so much abbonding.
And we have a bit of tenderness.
Let's put the doppy of proteins that help us, because it's a problem, it's a problem because, in reality, if we eat swords or too slow, yes, we may put on the weight, but if we put on the behavior of proteins, in reality, we're facing rivers, featured and increasing the risk of developing some pathology.
We don't do it, so the classic portion of the speaker, but we also do it in our heads.
What can be of the legs, the cards and the fish, in fact it's too abundant and eating so many vegetables, and we really take a large part of our daily protein sidewalk, why is it really?
To change more than what is used is a waste of resources, it's certainly something that we can improve, if more these proteins are proteins that have certainly.
An enormous environmental impact.
Mr.C.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put a few less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have an important health of certainly environmental benefit.
We know our health, but also.
Perhaps this thing, I hope that you'll be ready, don't have to worry about eating too much, this is the problem that, even more, if we do it at the world level, even in public spirits for society, I think it's more effective to try to persuade you, putting a few less proteins in theattoo.
And more possible, regarding animal products that have a low environmental impact.
You may be wondering, "Well, in other words, next year we will also be Expo, and there are a lot of people who talk about food of the future, the future, I mean so much insects.
Personally, I think I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we're not just a homeworker and I believe we'll hardly become it.
Which means that a protein food, which is absolutely here, is almost zero.
What can we do to make ourselves more self-productive at home?
And that for more we can nourish from vegetables, maybe not the ones that will be carried on a store, but the things that aren't able to use, what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the samples of surprise that are with me on the stage today, or of the bright.
Who has suffered the first arrhythm of the Trentin Sea, as you can see, is a decipher at night to go to letargo. In any case, I have a chance here because I like the lights?
And I mean, why can any of us self-protect them?
I'm a winning product.
It's a part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, we had more fooders of the exact location: about 35 years ago a law stops us from regaining them.
We were also the refrigerators of lumacks, but only one of us would appropriate the workers of professionals: this promoted a great development of light producers in Italy; and we are one of the countries, including the equivalent to global level, there are many thousands of producers in Italy.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to drop off the draft, or you can drive uova, and then feed it with vegetables, so to zero food waste.
And two times a year, you will have your recipe in your own spring, like an orchestra.
They stay at a time of cotting around an hour and then you can do whatever you want.
The Burghignon, the French scars, or richer a stranger, surely can dare satisfaction.
It's a meat among the other fathers, that has a lot of benefits, and it can, for me, not only the food of the future, but also the food of the present.
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they will never eat them, surely they need a small change, of course.
A change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices, are conscious that to ask you to pick up the likes, eat all the lips, start to start to start to start the lights that isn't such a simple thing, but I'm another distress.
Meaning proteins in theattoo, changing the way to see all the ingredients and benefits are really many.
So unit of me became revolutionary, because benefits really are so many, are for our health.
For well-being?
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you. (Applause)
I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six dots, that is part of one to six.
The other?
He went to ten faces: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you launch the data of ten gangs.
I'll put it on you.
But come to this game, let's put an equal or largest number of mine.
Ciao.
six to five.
Otherwise, have you become the player?
Trying with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory.
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
With a bit of peace starts and a lot of lights, I realized that the probability of victory was getting closer to 75%.
And with the mental of release, my stance based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portal must deliver to release in about 100 million data.
In just one second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
But a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Whispering) Now let me give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which I was so streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
(Laughter) The environment of work at exceptional levels, my performance, a supercomputer, seminating and conferences are at the orders of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and unbearable humanity.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and it's based on innovative research, and behind every student, there are ten, 100 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
But I spend most of my time alone on front of a computer or on a statistical background.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies west, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than to calm: to parallel.
In a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how tight you think, teach Maths and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, all that I had left before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
(Laughter) I didn't want to answer that question, I felt strict, I wanted to maintain this state of euphoria and that's how I accepted my degree, I started to live in directions and lessons, I wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to prepare solitary, I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, surprise them, and make them fun.
I tried to take advantage of all opportunities, I got a diploma in didacts with university students, and I began to teach two hours to student from the first year to more than twenty years to births of more advanced things.
So the judge was the job, more than so much efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
But I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Preparing with the process is a creative, stimulating process, a form of art.
I really like to run out the grades: read the readers' readers, right tricky they're, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman.
(Laughter) What about the wow?
Every time you grow, the lesson is my spettacol.
The gratitude of the students repeated entirely my career, and I was talking about them, as much as they were learning about me.
But, during the third year, there was also a specific recognition: the University of Warrick gave me the award for the emergence in education, as a young researcher.
(Laughter) In the cost of my PhD, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way.
But everything was so natural, beautiful, closer.
Well, in my little boy I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into place.
At that point.
I have to check everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to that question on the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, that fuel, that dissemination?
But the answer I gave was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
Is there a concert?
Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits.
There is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind will be in motion when I was trying to put in motion the lies of my students.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Applause)
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great.
But the university is not the only place where mathematics and communication meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But we will be going to see.
We've also told this capital of my story, because I think that what I've learned is shared.
The Monte Calla's method, for example, is to undertake a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or to find finality in the street that there were no expectations, like catalizers of our talents.
And the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a preparation of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
By her time's face?
I land the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise I've prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
But a young girl, in the front row, asks me if I can give some instructions about the questions I asked.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night listening to the friends of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have access to instructions.
Another guy, a few seconds ago, asks me where he can find other exercises to prepare.
(Laughter) It's true, we've had recently some time to practice, but there are plenty of materials on the Internet, and where to find it reflected on the rear of the scarc.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
(Laughter) I used to go to the washing machine, but I often live to them to ask how to procedure, to each point in practice, we perform a element of theory, which we reproduce the set.
Anyone makes a very difficult question, but I had spent the dinner of their text book, I was well prepared, I was chaos.
(Laughter) I work with them to make them take the breath.
It's then saying, "Waw, I'll encourage you to the magnifying glass for the exam."
(Laughter) A group of students breastfeed, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
Is it an ultimate student?
She approaches me.
I'm solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
And finally ...
It was too courageous, just to tell me.
Stop.
I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
(Sigh) Just keep in class, it's a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe this is exactly my place in this world.
(Laughter) Well, this is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are worthy, and that's why.
When the mind in motion, even the heart, the battles fly inside the pitch, it's the mind runs in movement, thanks.
It's a physically starting in November, Dario à Mosca, in Trento, we held the research, we put basically and supported by the mothers, and they started to grow up the bathrooms, finishing research against cancer from the prostate, over 29 million dollar.
Good afternoon everyone.
Today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my prosthesis about leadership.
In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, so a little Jesco's merit in a bar, I'm giving a book.
And as often the captain, when I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me out of others, started to listen to extreme conversations, then there was in front of me a coppy.
What was talking about change, she said to her, "We must change your feet, you should do this, in other words, change.
It's a central topic: Samatina my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, when everyone approacts the change, the first thing that is is beyond fear.
your diversity.
If you feel diverse, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with diverse intelligences.
One of which has more intelligences and you're there to mix and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in reality, it doesn't just know how to get out, and the opportunity appears here, instead of diversity, that is how to integrate...
Everything that has brought a different background, remembering my daughter one day.
Alright!
It's a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so at some point, the girl says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Clo, are we really three men?
And she says, "No, no, her two, you know with mom."
I guarantee you this: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
Now, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the right thing.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
This is the difficulty, but, if one of you says...
I want to create a culture of change, on the other, you need to create leaders, change, that I've worked for many years.
In companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
It's not the immediate thing.
The most brilliant leaders do this: So, always drinking this cake, at some point it started to write, I'm always in the United States to write in a paper.
The word change thanks to this word change, I'm giving a thought that I don't know how many hours and I start putting into other words: transformation, creativity, until then, in this case, to play.
It starts to put together these words and form an act: hunting.
Great!
In fact, it's a prison itself, it's a bit of achievement that, to me, of course, this is a prosecutive of personal entirety.
Today, a leader must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an accident, it is to know that creative transformation and change.
What's the new setting here?
For me, at least, the increase.
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, in management.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the prospective change that ...
But what I thought was to take this leap, to do things, to enjoy the sounds.
To work on projects.
Bring people from one part to another to be, and in this way there is a transformation that involves you, being involved, I don't want to do a project that is paid for the project, but what is the transformation that I carry?
To what, to the development of creative thinking, which brings it a little?
What makes this transformation move?
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A bit of the ability to dream: to this model, we've imagined it later, through five years.
The fundamental pillars: the first one would know about transforming.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of ads, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity.
Sport: "Samattina we started with a sweet, brainstorming, it's one of the tips that allow you to fulfill your life.
Creativity.
What do you do with creative thinking, trying to work on divergent thinking and convergente thinking?
But this is not enough.
We need to take a leap and ...
Doing a slightly deliberate movement, right?
Let's start to involve that which is the emotional part, the frame of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
This is, to precisely encourage the absence of sex to your emotions.
Those forts, those that make us feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
Here's the fear, that when you feel you're not brave, and you have to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's also those, when you know about your emotions, you can let yourself support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing -
That's it.
It's not that you keep indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a modification.
The only thing is, no, but you live in a transformation that is personal, consciousness of your emotions leads you to do this.
To give the numerous examples of leader who have done, who have made these messages, just to suffer in the Italian field, certainly deserve marimets with Rome, but also those with Milano you know that it was awarded at the other day, as the world's magical enterprise, for innovation, and it has grown up to 67 percent.
Transformations.
They observe, as they say, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is exactly what you have to work.
to create in a responsible way.
Opportunity: Let's say that I manage to create cylinder, but in reality?
I'm not so much about the idea of...
Great.
But how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is to support the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and this is not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results as if the results were achieved only in one way.
But on the other hand, dare ...
It's an opportunity leader.
To build a weather with its own actions.
I also have the opportunity to do what?
To explore new definitions.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
Being there, there's a bit of competition, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, it's better I can't say it, it's better that I'm in silence, I start all this internal dialogue, and what's interesting when we're in this situation is: "How can I do it?"
It allows me to collect creative spirit.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, that necessarily ...
It doesn't laugh if it's an organic compound, even if it's a very common relationship to re-invent a very customer relationship.
The prosecutive is completely changed, so to get back to that original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
So the sense of attention we've seen in the video is, as to say, love is the volcano for the development of creative thinking, but this crappone clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all.
The thing of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
Then it goes out.
So, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to land.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
So there's the chance.
to see from above.
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
of the man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Check it out!
These places to be together are mass.
They can live not all separated, but together.
It's like...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better?
Placing this phenomenon?
The limit.
And this is a story that goes back in time, actually this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money in this city.
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and they became quite famous.
Kar Marx is his friend Hang.
They were practicing for Mancester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They were stripped, without daughters.
Poveritata, opening.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both writes there.
It was called "the conviction."
The classroom operated in the city.
When they accused the city of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city of being.
Causa.
of inequality, insecurity, poverty.
And there was no other way.
What limiting this phenomenon was possible to say?
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Behind, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
Nacquevo!
Also, the discipline of tools to limit this phenomenon, I realized that it was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendousness that, maybe, some of you have heard about, has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rub for which, when you have changed a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
And then ...
The pianification.
The piano, in other words, the idea that there is someone from the event that has to dream.
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or even in the end, the Zonization that fortunately you haven't met all, but who has even managed to say?
Is it worth imagining?
In a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies: culture.
It's a huge spectrum against cities.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manatta?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It has a prison where all the world's challenges are launched by the upset and can be scanned for you.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all the processes, this leads to adventure a little lungar from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
Otherwise, I'm a member of science.
This feeling is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
We know that the city is not the cause of all the world.
Under the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution.
All the greatest questions here are related to the human brain.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
Understanding the economic development, the work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Knowledge.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The mentors that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, can you see what myallels are?
My photo was taken from the upshots of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities?
Imagineations that can be in the same painting method.
Both more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
To be richer, people from all over the world, people call me soccer and other people who also ignore me the most famous call.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Listen to my idea.
That the city, in the end, is scared, and in some way addressed as a solution?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The bigness.
The inhabitants are all used to confront this other city for the inhabitants, for the massive, for the GDP, right?
The city is a mechanism.
The city works and will solve it.
The greatest questions of humanity?
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I have different interests.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
To be young people who have different goals.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, with such individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
So?
A city can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Why?
Maybe right now?
After thousands of years of history, these abilities are temporary suspected.
Walter!
Magari?
Think about it, maybe you may consider that right now, or in some periods.
Remember how to be.
This mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
These measures and tools of containment of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
It's the job I've been doing in the last years.
And that they are not afraid.
The Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
You can feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast!
with utopia and color.
The first example?
Dimila.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From that satellite.
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
What about us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving towards the city.
The idea is...
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbitical stage that every day can walk, like we do.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps, can you imagine?
It's a element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
First of the lack of solution, cities like nurses.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have this in mind.
The second example is now that.
a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do with this city in 2030 with all of them happy?
Buenos Aires, more than in others.
The País is the magnet.
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed, was in some way untouched.
Violence, poverty also derived from a higher national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
It limits development.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
The ability to believe.
In the power of this mental weapon.
What are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do Zyo accelerate?
And what do you see as an asset?
A shell of intensity, which means a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician:
The creation of pedonal spaces or glasses, you can see this...
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million.
The living in the city, building...
Situing?
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency, but from all over the world and the creatives to Yunix.
Then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I hell.
That allows us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
Are you spacious?
Diver and pedonals.
And this tragedy requires together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
Do you know?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Keep it?
And Makaki.
By entering the spot on the spotlight, let's take a look at the other.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
So many times.
And maybe?
Are you very proud?
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
This way, our thinking.
The words of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They are evocating that they are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion.
I'm his neck.
I'm not.
Evocative, they laugh with our history.
"Yeah!"
To beauty was our language.
And it's the fact that this beauty is seen.
Tutterata, preserved, perceptible.
Once again.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'll talk about...
Madea raised.
The English word: menstration.
The idea is often motivated by darkness.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But it's been a bit long.
And I'll start to show you.
Some endless twins.
They were motivated to a link of segment and the largest universities in the world.
And they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a cong, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana.
It's incodeous.
Indigenous.
In Svetia.
On the united leg, the Kins College of London, and on the united Oxford paper.
In Chicago, a list of unites.
Great!
It says "You know," in your insurance.
Not just that.
universities.
Happyly.
They will say if they are in Latin.
"Ah! I don't know
Londra has a Latin motto.
That's it!
It has a Latin motto, Canada.
It has a Latin motto.
Kinsler, in Australia, has a motorcycle.
But not just that.
The American Marina says, "I know I've finished it, you've heard it."
In a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even a prostitution there is no stone to be a passportist like NASA.
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
Why am I not doing that late with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a single place in the world.
In which a Latin motto could stay.
What about this?
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What's the old mark?
Rome city has proven and launched from the Human municipalities.
That's it.
She doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, me and you, wow, Mom."
What's the basis sample of law?
What is this contamination, this quote between two crazy lines that gives sense to each of us what are with the five pallets high?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
But because, when we are all the tourist patients from all over the cities of the world, there is no one who does what is required to settle their name.
I was promising.
None of them.
Just that.
"Dad, you've got your penetration."
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
(Laughter) Apparently moved from the country?
[Inglese] - Minister of Benicuto, look beautiful.
Risconta?
(Laughter) "No, it's not very nice to see, Beautiful," "So we're Italian, in a way completely insensitated."
"Duestile" spica.
In Italian, we're talking also Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
I've sponsored the most dominant language in the world, according to your linguistic view, what do I know?
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, don't do anything.
For example.
The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us.
Pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States in front of the negotiation map with the same quantity of the negotiation map that sold to hamburgers.
Hotdoxem, comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
Keep here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
If there's a story to promote in the week of Italian wine, of Colombian.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
And they say?
That's it.
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
This is it.
It's what scratches the revive magician, Italian fashion.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the "winter."
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
"Please, I ask you who has told me."
A disorder.
Docus: "Cordi" as if it were a ...
I'm a mountain in Grean Canyon.
And no folks.
How are we in our debates?
And the women we see in ours?
I'm lying to be born.
It would work.
But if I'm Greek.
I'm short.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy, and it speaks English.
There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if we perfect the union?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go to our radicies, let's call us theandini, this, "I'm on the Only."
Runion.
The radicies of the seems Catitalian.
We are segmented.
The curious thing, why?
Or two such words: an Italian in two doesn't like an English word.
I am 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we see it.
(Laughter) And here we have to spare that the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled the sign, who has compiled this model of the island, are better than linguistic competitions.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are orto-vincial.
We use a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
It's not true.
It's necessary to enter the thesis of the Italian language, purely, accessoly and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasion, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The nazzle is the "locker" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must create a set of straight lines united from the face to satisfaction.
(Laughter) It's connected with business.
When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this gang on the clicket service, because then the unite business is always kind, white and general.
The journalism and the e-mail share it not only in companies, but also in media: recording public.
The Goverde.
We have a law from the State called Jobsect, and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't solve it much better.
And I have forced the newspapers of Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We made a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I have details:
I had to do something: communicate my friendship.
Or in mind two or three words: "Wes, tools that can be effective."
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, to put a start to walk, "Ped".
Fat.
Sensibilization activates this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
I'm a bit of energy.
This petition?
who invented it.
Public public records, the government!
The printers, the media, to say it.
In Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for us.
A speech from the year.
But not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting a name, a cup, a signal, and there are 70,000 people.
After all, everything.
Giovanni, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spray that the homes have signed letters and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed meetings, professionals and called pensioners, signed up.
Italian people in the west to say, "What are we doing with our language and signed up yesterday?"
It's a film for the whole world.
Singapore, Jedus Jalemy, from Pedudal, South Africa and north Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's something with a movement, I did it.
Open.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
"You'll come from someone."
The Italian is a Dedit.
But also a doarm.
We're notved at FUFA.
If we think secondly, we'll talk other tango secretly: workers in a public record, help.
Not because I've studied Classic Alice, but I've worked with economists.
I've lived in fashion, I've received a deal of laughing, it's not overview of the trend, I don't think there was, (Laughter) an Italian and an English speaker, I've been better than a teenager, the English, Sisher.
And we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the people.
Sterepitosa: I have a strange name, but italian Parlian says, "Tchung, go Rome food."
The first one, for those of you, began to talk about our language decence, because I would never like to say: "Steen years is funny that occasions are spilled."
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We celebrate because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
That's why I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old.
Thanks for the motors.
That's it.
I'd say: an echo.
Straordinared to discharge, because mass media has trapped that which cost 0.
Does it not amplify it?
This initiative is used.
Around 130 little ones on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable.
They talked to them together, grammarines and will be on the stamp on the dispubblic side, and they gathered a lot of applause, a security area and sell it.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vaniti Ferr talked about this.
He didn't talk about Christian family.
He spoke to me the Siri of Tuding.
It hasn't spoken today that behind the auditorium, a transversality.
What accounts!
And it is estimated all the usual tree, also a little bit of core and a little here.
And that you go deeply to dare to test more thanchia and hang out the most populated ones.
And I'm often a great wish of riachrums related to the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional people, and I also had to put myself in the city, and I was interested in an Australian radio, a lion.
That's necessary.
And then there is.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Conclusion is some reason to do.
Afterwards, the Indian aid to make us understand and it's a fact of dismaking, because it makes us understand a fact of dismaking.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the agend, bring it to the world, because it presents it.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
Be better.
And then.
"This doll is tolerated!"
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonaldo himself defined "Homo Litter."
That he was scratching in vulgar, that is in Italian.
Every time.
The structure, the form of decency.
Go to the Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
We resign, express one of the pecuriarities.
From its flessuosity.
Delletto.
Wonderful!
Potentiality.
Our specifically Italian creativity.
Which is the bike in your language kills.
Even more, if our linguistic thesis is "sort," normally, we can attach to some term strange for personality.
But we have to put it inside a thesis that is not fulfilling.
The logo, the logo.
From a silver medal to an excess.
Finally, nothing, misunderstood.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
I started to see if I was still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the worst idea of being a young boy.
As everyone went to school, I liked and sat down with my friends, but what's behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
The tsunami is called the health problem, and when one in two parents hits, and you're still a child, a teenager, they're your points of dissemination, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hatred that they alter, strongly, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
The difficulty to concentrate.
And also the need to take care of domestic gangs, like sponsorships, or charging fans, are lines smaller, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But how do we add that?
You could manage barriers and emergencies, so no one has prepared you, how to manage the situation while your father or your mother sees many things that don't exist in psychosis.
"Oh!
You must have to do with alternating in depression rooms, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, paying attention to suicide attacks.
But how do we add all this?
Furthermore, we also have to live all the time, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that we add another goal.
It's often not able to talk to anyone.
There's science.
That your mother or Tovaban, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly somebody will hear it for this or will remind you of parents' problems or deaf people.
It's hard for somebody to consider you as a genetically committed, and destined to automatic is to edit the same discourse.
But if I tried to say, "Hey, what about your mom or your grandmother?"
They have a metaphoric disorder, a bipolar disorder, a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't work?"
The answer of the foreign world will be completely different.
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good.
Living to all of us, and this brings a way to understand what is happening inside of you to your own care, a message to ask and receive help many times not to receive them.
And for you who are a child, the doctor gets even more heavy.
[A.DE.]
The weather that we perceive around you is difficult to communicate inside you and then the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the embarrassment can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rage, and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to pull, that no one from the school imagined.
When the first grade started to open in that hill when, for the first time, light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consulte that the first person walked out of the family, the one I was able to open and that helped me, we must see people sitting around me the certainty they could be supported.
Later on the Internet on the forum, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things my parents had gave me.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
But it's statistically impossible: in the world we are millions of people.
Or we invited us to experience him, that there is no one who has lived the same things we've experienced.
And you know why it happens, because our children's stories we don't talk about.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada.
Not only could I give a name to my emotions, but also to understand that they were natural reactions to what I had experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics that were born, precisely to face that situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent man, by myself, and I went to Vancouver in Canada, to the first conference I mentioned, and the wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult man, had to feel only when one in the books began to suffer from a psychological disturb, because they saw the story I've experienced, but also that of writing, their view, their view, their view, the story I've experienced, the story that I've experienced, that I've seen, the story that I've experienced, that I've experienced, that I've experienced, that they wanted to write, the spirituals, the spirit that they need to write, the spirit, the spirituals, the spirituals, the spirit that I wanted to write, the spirituals, the spirituals, the spirituals, the guards, the guards, that I wanted to write,
As not to risk again to draw the weight of the world all around my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017 with other children, Italians, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to start the first Italian association, children for other children, and it's called "Comit, Pacile and Nffmental Peranza, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
We gave the journey to a project that started underneath, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room right now, who have grown up in this same desire, they have given us the opportunity to do it, by parents, with a mental disorder, and I have written, and that I'd also wanted to have more hands, or when I was 15.
At first, when I thought about this project, I was in detail: I won't make it realise how I did it, the piano, but I asked people around me to help scursionists, proposing to tell a story of the mini guides in the owner of our community's library.
And now we are able to reach so many regions, from the back to Sicilia and Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach them all, another wish we have is that we believe that we are moving the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
The other huge desire we're realizing is to meet schools, to talk to the students, to the youngsters, not only Filger Giver, but everyone, for us.
You'll have to see a house of atoms to make fronts.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the shifts of life, being disenged, before...
It's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
Wow!
It was one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that our parents with mental disorder have is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open for us, and we can enter the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Aron Smart.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I will surely play a hacker in common sense.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Five years ago, they were in a group that read RSSSSS, maybe you don't know much about it, but it was Ubic in the sphere until ten years ago.
And it began, at 15 years old, the creative people, who were responsible for the technical part: today, creative Commons are around a world full of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most flexible and open copyright.
I am, for example, Wikipedia license.
At the age of 20, a small start-up started to build something that's called a reddit, becomes a millionaire from one day to another.
Honestly, they didn't take so much money or fame, they still do what they've always done to build an open and collaborative Internet, with an open and open Internet, two digital libraries, that are literally saving the web, protecting the files of digital memory.
There is one of the protagonists of the Blow against Soppa, a bias law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do monopoly.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years ago, all the messages, the economy, the history of education, information.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
She told her mother that, at some point, she was carrying out, and aaron was two and a half years old, was sent in her fridge and being.
The avenue on the fridge she had just attacked with me.
The calamine.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents memory, the RSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creators of Commos are a copyright, so they make it accessible to people.
And the content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
We need to think of a second at all, in schools, libraries, universities.
Information, it said from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
Which means creating a democratic level: our democracia, literally, is based on giving access to education learning, without this, there is no democracia.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this?
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
What if all institutions are social?
They are people's facts, so fundamentally they're culture, so they're fundamentally made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
None.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Huxas.
Great movement for free access to scientific literature.
And the world of scientific literature, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many, big publishers.
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
And I said, "There were...
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
I had taken care of him.
Not an accident.
Of this genius, it's probably not happening to observe.
Does your opportunity to do that Aaron's, another one?
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
"Yes."
The aromine facts of a veracity and its judgmental persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists of academic disadvantages and could do it, but not in this situation.
And they are responded to actors of computer pyramid.
About 35 years old.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And it comes equipped with more nim than seeing a terrorist.
Two years later, her first treasure.
They stopped at home in New York.
She was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it.
What is power information?
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: No, no.
I've seen there was favola.
(Applause)
Santen ... (Laughter) Thank you.
Now, all the tables will get out.
CR: What do you talk about?
The next one is Fairy Eiffel.
(Applause)
I felt New... (Laughter)
You know that the sports system is a sports system, which is a sports system, which is a sport system for craft learning and water.
And then, how do you do it?
The line was drowned in the dust in Messen's caves, and it was the mourning.
So, how do you do it?
To give you an idea: this mix of immersion of a winter of the universe.
It's basically.
Well, this is a little more interesting.
Do you know what the tragedy is?
The second one.
One thing ...
It's essential.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass sponsor's platform is used to spy, to control, to oppress, but there's also another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, free, a place of total freedom, freedom of expression.
These are the two places, there are things that coexist in the same way: the Internet is too complex.
To be just one thing.
"Yeah."
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
It's not something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here.
The hell we live every day, which we form is together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning goes on.
Trying to know who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell.
And to make it hard and give the spacies.
As all of them will be, in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly with a glimpse look.
It's duty.
Do you have all how many?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was overwhelmed, no, it had made a argument: in our gallery there are hundreds of thousands of stelle, most of them are the oldest in our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has 4 billion and a half.
A few years ... Before, what if life was in parallel?
Any other planet around one of these stars.
Very old, so very first.
Because on Earth, it could be like intelligent galleries, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, than we do, maybe we'd be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been informed of none of these intelligent civilizations.
And here's the question to close, I mean, where are all the many?
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it has become many more simple, it's that there's no one out there.
We are single.
So, this is possible.
I think this is a question that we've asked all of us how many, before or after, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a stelling sky.
I asked myself if, around those bright bright lights, could be planets, planets of living beings, that perhaps in that moment were waiting for my vocation, they are asking the same question, we are alone in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there is no one at the center of the universe, because there is no center in the universe, a seventh and a half ago.
Charles Darwin explained to us that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come, we all descend from an antennas.
Comune.
Also, finding the scientific knowledge of the existence of other worldwide countries, I think it would be a third big paradeable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two.
For this reason, well, in the last years we have probably done many things going on in the directions of a possible answer, not yet we have it, an answer, but we are the first human beings.
To have scientific evidence that there are pianists around other arms.
This is one of the biggest news in astrophysics, in the last 20 years, 20 years we would have been able to suspect it.
Because there were other planets out there, but now we have proves: we know thousands of planets around other estrellas, already and ...
We can see that it's very likely that every bottle of our galaxy has at least one planet, so we're talking about gigantic numbers, hundreds of billions of planets, and penets that we know, in fact, we also know that many of them are at the same distance from their bottle to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so we don't have any definitive evidence, such as planets, for example, if they have an atmosphere.
So, to understand if there are the conditions for the presence of life, and even, in a future, not too far away, we could address this light of tracks of tips that could say that, effectively, one of these planets could be.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be witnesses at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I'm sorry, I really believe it would be an epocentric change.
One of the questions we could ask is that often, in fact, it's from the fact that we will reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare religions, no, because they're incredibly far away from us, they're separated from a flight ocean, the universe really is really very big, and then I'll give you an example, a specific example: this son, my mirrors, and you, Geruno, that has become farther away.
The land has been traveling for a quarantine of years, and has reached the stars of the Solar System, and has entered the space in testtelling, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km later, 17 km per second.
So a huge speed, but you know how much would it put?
This one.
This space probe to reach the bottle closer to ours, Proxima Centauri, themselves traveling in that direction.
We'd put 74,000 years old.
Better than any citizen civilty is.
It's existed on us.
We could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the fast consent.
In nature.
What an empty!
For more than four years to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that, so also to communicate on radio with other systems that would ask hundreds or thousands of years of the impairment and the reaction of a rising.
So it's all very complicated, maybe we're not alone in the universe, but we surely seem isolated, we are.
According to me, here is one of the things you have here when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of ferment, and then the interrogative, actually, that we all have, here, where all of us are here.
The fact that keeping present is time.
And we use it.
One example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand sinisters and the tip of my left hand.
It's the transitional time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, 4 billion in the middle of years, really.
And then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here.
From hand to hand, there is the explosion of shape.
The dinosaurs, the multicellular organisms, the most completed on a network of billions of cells, the animals, the stars.
At the end of the palm of your hand drowning.
"Yes."
In the beginning of the last failure, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely.
The impact of a great asteroid is space through the earth, along with three quarters of living species at that moment on the planet, and it's the distinction of these small, big, there have been many times throughout this long history of life, and it even shows that 99% of the species have experienced this planet are similar.
So this gives us the idea that...
This long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long journey, difficult, accident, and governed by ...
They were unbelievable, and that didn't necessarily have to bring to the origin of more complex organisms and not that we should bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
That's it, we.
In all this, where are we?
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because we know it today.
That for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been with us other human species that are no longer there, like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there is another life in the universe, it is very probable that it will be a microorganism.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be shocking, incurable, compared to life times.
of the Universe.
Surely, they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they've completed a certain level of technological progress, to feed themselves, or simply get involved with harassment, they spark, without leaving.
With no track.
Then maybe this is in the universe.
Big cosmic silence that disrupts us and bothers us, maybe a little bit ...
A kind of warning, maybe it's saying something.
Life had to overcome it?
The big number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species.
From far away, let's imagine ourselves seen from another planet.
But if we spark.
Domani.
Probably, in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
Let's think of a very young species: As soon as a seventh started to fly, to communicate on the radio, on a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived to the residents.
But the solar system, in fact, we've just put the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What's science?
And I think that closing us here would really be a bit like a fool.
As differences of dinosaurs, we have, at least in part, the chance of...
Changing, influencing our destiny.
We certainly have the capacity to feed ourselves, but we also have as I believe, and I hope.
The possibility of helping scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us to guarantee.
The long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day.
Is life on some other?
The planet is expensive, maybe in a far away future, so far as to reach other stars.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive as long as possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep it accessible, so that we can achieve this?
It's wonderful to be a sample of consciousness, sorry, in case.
Piccoloped planet lost in the weapon of the cosmos.
Thank you.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of victory.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before, classifies, but from the done sport and generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that is likely...
Then, when you believe you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength.
First, believe it.
(Audience) Yes!
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 Chileans that later became.
I don't know, I joined two, because Centro Quattro was just a few, no, I didn't even add up to two, because the six is a number that will come back for more times, long this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All of us?
The rivals, instead of running, are instead of being worried about the water.
To get the first ones.
I've come in the last few years, all of us arrive together, after these 16 Chileometers employees.
The journey is the difficulty, right now, in the first days, we're terrified in Windoka.
Up to the bottom, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, there's enough difficulties, we arrived in the desert of me, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet, this I know is an important number.
This is an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 Chileans all of us, we do them during our apartments, but the desert is general, and the crown is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, it began to do things.
Later, the unexpected things happen in life, and even in the crop, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a garage, whether it's time, or to do something beautiful, you have to move forward and know energy.
There's always the chance.
And I was the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
That's it.
Calm down the sun!
(Sound of soccer) You want to do it for this ghost.
(Laughter) And, in fact, you put me ... surprise... (Laughter) I don't like it anyway!
Actually, I couldn't mold, I couldn't mold because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Founderising.
An important initiative to help children: an important initiative to take pictures of the fight against the Rochedoma.
The neuroplastics is a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, I before this experience, I didn't know very well its existence, and when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert because it's wisdom.
Do I calculate it?
Very calm, in the Namibi desert, in December, high school, it ran with 61 grades, during the long marathon of 42 kilometers, which was lasted as long as it was about 7 pm, I had different problems, such as bracity, darkness, and darkness, it was like that, because we had to move forward our garbage.
When you see if you're alone or almost, this was at the beginning of the second cover, that slightly lighter, you get a km, so nothing dramatic, but it was a beautiful cover.
And we also feel during all of our things.
Even better, during all our work activities of the invincible, we feel inhabitable, we feel...
But it's powerful, unfortunately, in the desert you realize you're a punctuum, a punctuum, maybe where you and I run around 15, 20 kilometers where there was nothing, and you also inspect that the things of the beautiful life.
I'm not just cellulare, I've invested the best fashion, absolutely many young people to be happy must have the cellulare on the extreme fashion, and at some point in the middle of the desert a beach that came to eat, they stopped.
It depends on the Pumin, there's an argument: at this desert, it's going to take a warning from one stole, there's the door to the warning and it tells us, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this warning."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know, enjoy it.
And I don't know if you know that with salt I can eat.
And I don't know if you know, but what I do, medicine was also happy for the abuse.
Now we don't have to be happy, probably only for survival, it's good to be happy with so many other things, but it's also important to sometimes valuate how fortunate we are, the desert of anamibia is the desert I chose, why?
Because inside the Nanamai Pesiste desert is the highest Duna in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when we are there, we made it of race or almost.
It's strange, you can see it there, on the tip of the bar that then split from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because my desert doesn't exist, it doesn't.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, only five Chileans were left.
We are already the Chilean, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and what I did now.
[The public sends a bathroom]
Sorry, it's left in the last four kilometers when we make other two more.
"Yes, it's a big pit." "Why am I walking well, I'm happy?"
And nothing, thanks to all of you that are in your strength.
(Video) Ricardo: Look, there's no more.
And I found myself in the desert.
Although this morning, as I mentioned the small principle of my well-being, I found many people who shared with me, other than 26 people, because it's a garage.
With many contents: 96, they were truly know, 96 people who had run with me, in the end, the last two km could also not do them, because the challenge was 104 had a long time, and in the end, there was a magic, an incredible magic.
As you can see, they were all very humble, I also had the share, because the horses were a bit rigid.
So these are us because the organization that had done to a Chile far away from the front had given me the gang to give me the opportunity to come and finish the uffician cabin, then return back, take the other Chilean, and then go back toward, to reach 100 years.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to get to these years.
(Music) The short food was over and achieved its objective: December 20th, 2016 that, if you take the figures, are exactly the numbers that make 116 km, really in the inside, in number 6, important and recurrent number, the interesting thing that we have finally reached.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
One capita time, people were returning.
And I was surely facing 100 meters and already made it fatal: (Heavy breathing)
I wasn't alone.
Yeah!
Look, ahh!
I looked at a wife that was enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who was already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six, and Pietro, and nothing.
Ricardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in first elementary, so big, I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his and Pietro Panince, obviously, had already understood, meaning.
It's a bit like...
Like the corsa.
What I said before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
AC: This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating emorecity, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the birth, and it lowered hardly, and this is the last time I saw him smiling.
(Audience) Yes!
And...
Audience: Yes!
And then, what happens?
When did it look?
When it seemed like everything went well?
Hmm, February 18.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack.
Because it was too expensive.
So, ah!
The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Clearly not male.
I have nothing.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but...
In these moments?
You don't have to let go.
And it needs me.
(Applause) But you have to keep on trying now.
The strength is the one who is stretching?
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And Riccardo, keep moving forward in life.
To give the chance to the other two that arrived: is it arrived at Emma?
Emma came on January 29th to San Pietra.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them.
I had to absolutely be positive, and I wanted to never give up, so I had absolutely had to do what to manage to create or improve my life, improve my way, not only from the point of view, let's say so visual, but above all from there.
From the physical point of view, to be able to give strength to people, and to be me, stronger, and so I started running the first image you see on the record is my first marathon, the queen of truth beautiful.
I ended up arriving in Namibia desert, where these 16 kilometers have brought me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you see there the perfection, which I wanted to take 21200 euros.
It's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
And this year in November went to the desert of Omanna and Chileans will be 165.
So here too, there are combinations of many - 165 kilometers completely in self-sufficience.
So I was just there.
Let's see, let's wait until the end, but the desert is different, but the goal is always the medal, that is to get the money to help children and help them do better, and the message so that today is an important message.
Anyone is.
The difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always there is hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
in 2017.
Three times I know, come with me.
As you want to interpret it, thanks to everything.
