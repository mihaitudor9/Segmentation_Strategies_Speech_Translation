(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently far away: Be, you must know that until some time my two pictures are missing.
Better raised.
Mars and Francesca.
And, in addition, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolate?
It's terrible.
The words were tired to get out, they just stayed.
Play it in your mouth.
Over the years, the child becomes a boy.
But we suffer a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, psychologists, all brave people, a lot of professionals, but nobody can do it.
To take this incarct.
One day, I traveled to Roma.
And so, just for pure fortune?
Take a look at a little girl.
His name was Teresa.
Equestion.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around you said "Mrs. Teresa," but what beautiful words of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the forest of his country, they were celebrating a big party with a birthplace.
And a microphone, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the desire of this young man, of feeling the battles we had written, the comic fights were too big, and he didn't think about it.
He left for free of the surgeon, took the seventh microphone, and everybody went out, I was a computer engineer, think I was so brave in the internet than my first words just before were: web, web!
That's how it happened.
People were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That young man ...
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mother would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What is a moment?
I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me: finding a disability, you can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of people.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
Trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They're the words of the little soccer room.
Tumbia Frey.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius is my wife, that says, "Yes, that's a doctor, but our son is a mask and a female."
The doctor says, "Scuse, sign, maybe she didn't understand, and trisomy 21."
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "Oh, but there's a misery, we don't even know when we were able to produce NELA mask, but it's summ!"
And the doctor has given us the middleman to the doctor, because ... (Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause) We can talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult of our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superhero.
Anyone.
After a few months.
(Applause) And even the most beautiful thing that have brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that it has resulted all the best people, it has become the best of them, the best of their suffering, and all the people who, somehow, find.
Now this is not the potential.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by speeds, analyses, we know everything, but few.
Many of these people had encountered people.
And then, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Sound Anna", where so, without asking us too much about seriously, but not for anything, old, saying.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you may wear, but you know from one as a physician at school," and then we made this card where Anna says, "You know you're wearing a while ago Francesca, came home," saying, "You know, here?
Or another one, where she says, "But it's true that you suffer from Down syndrome and you don't give birth to blue eyes," "Bella, this is said with Down syndrome," because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in addition, I don't know, I'll give you an example: have you present TED talk?
You built a small X.
(Applause) No, because I'll give you this example, because here today, to meet TED, talk to people, you've done a bit of fat, so the invitation is to make a little bit of fatal and don't prevent the encounters of disability that will be in your life, both persons, but also some people around you, a very small advertisement.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on the Internet.
Or a grader alone.
Well, to wake up the eyes you have to put them at the same level.
And in this sense, it captivates me many times of losing: that's why I like a politician to leave bricks along my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon.
With this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you.
To try to trace disabilities.
In your life.
To clarify it.
And most importantly.
Remember?
The pause.
What can you look at the face?
They become brave.
Thank you very much.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who sees or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And I understood what my mission in the world was, in fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds, nor a romantic disorder, as they told us about some speakers earlier, but for an ortag, it went well, it could go onstage, while swimming, ortags.
To make you realize how scary it scares every day, of how much scarc percentual it has happened to me, it's what has happened to me one night because of a traffic, and this thing has opened my mind, has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment I decided that what I had done, what would be my mission in the world.
It seems there would be nothing left to be drawn.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's what we can decide for us, for our family, every single day, and not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact.
Because our food choices that are usually part of our daily environmental impact: if we want to translate it into indice, we can talk, for example, of ecological pressure.
And it increases much more what we choose to ordinary the opponent, that maybe the way we dress or how we move to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be.
If nothing else is perfectly aware of the choices they make each day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
And it's optimizing.
I say that almost a word is referring to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the life of every day, especially to what is our inhortion with food, using that is, for example, the way in which we use defense.
It's how we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
And then, obviously, to try to use 100% of the raw materials.
Mr.M.
Another thing of consumption is to optimize consumers.
And above all, also the way we make the interact every day.
So, what are we, indeed, carrying on a table?
The pillaries, I entered this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the thread, of the rejects, of what we usually travel, and here in front of you have a small example of...
I look at the first nobilities: we're used to doing what I'm doing now every day at home, when we pull the vegetables.
And to separate from one part, there is the noble part that we use and on the one hand, there is the scary.
I'm scared, so the less noble part.
In average, it's approximately 50% in winter, and up to 70% of the size of so many green.
They took more protected parts.
So what does it mean to optimize in the kitchen means to simply recover these things?
That's about being rejected, that means having a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joint together.
Let's take an example with mine.
I can see her with me.
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also cost such an natural cake.
I looked for it.
And if I buy it, maybe I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I do a fantastic Tisana that, if I buy the aircraft, it probably cost me more, the garden.
I focused on it and I lasted it closely, so, if you don't like too much damaged by the chicken, you can concentrate on the bus, and it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit certainly for health, but not only with all internal features I can prepare a cell, the seeds.
Can I tolerate them or simply make them manage?
And to manage something I think is a practical example.
A very simple technology, but it allows us to transform, to value a technology.
Something that we all have at home and that we usually don't give up on a look and go on a way.
So optimize in the pool for me, especially this: changing a little bit your mentality and seeing with a different eye.
In particular, ants, but all food to sprease less and appreciate it to the maximum: optimizing is also optimizing the consumption of energy heater, for example.
And many times here I have too much or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, water there were other things.
Worms are enough to have a box, it's not that suits the idea, or sometimes with an appliance like the vast.
It's also used to know, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that some of you are shooting the gear, but it's a very high spoon technique, the bass temperature, so it doesn't happen that you can use a professional instrument for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use the vast, all the time you're wearing, as you do.
A very practical example.
Take a glass like this, it must be your hermetic therapist.
For example, let's say something new, cover with the water and listen well, and repeat it to the mix of sporous gatti, wake warn you must not be fully full, full of hatisports like always, and then learn the washing that you prefer to choose based on the circumst of gangs, and vice versa, when the washing ends up your feast, it will be fantastic because it will imply zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, or zero, or zero, or cow, in the second basis, must be zero, or second, or coast, in the total bathrooms, in the total bathrooms.
To optimize the use of domestic adaptation I think can give beneficial interests.
Another application of optimizing this time to theattoo, I even entered your home in your home: But when we were in war, OK?
There was a lot of food.
We had a few proteins, they earned a lot of patates, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the cake, for example, the candles.
The protectiveatti was a party, and it was like this: now the problem is opposite, we have so much abbonding.
And we have a bit of tenderness.
Let's put the doppy of proteins that help us, because it's a problem, it's a problem because, in reality, if we eat swords or too slow, yes, we may put on the weight, but if we put on the behavior of proteins, in reality, we're facing rivers, featured and increasing the risk of developing some pathology.
We don't do it, so the classic portion of the speaker, but we also do it in our heads.
What can be from the legs, cards and fish, in fact it's really too abundant, eating so many vegetables, and in fact we take a large part of our daily protein sidewalk, why is it really?
To change more than what is used is a waste of resources, it is certainly something that we can improve, if more these proteins are proteins that have certainly.
An enormous environmental impact.
Mr.C.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put a few less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have an important health of certainly environmental benefit.
We know our health, but also.
Let's say about all our country, even more if we do it at the world level, even in public spices for society, I think it's more efficient to try to convince you, to put a few fewer proteins in the contact that maybe try to eat them in a better way.
And more possible, regarding animal products that have a low environmental impact.
Those of you may be wondering, "Well, in the next year, we will also be excited, and there are a lot of people talking about food of the future, I can say so many insects, personally I believe I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we're not just a consumer country of insects, and I believe it's hardly going to be done.
So, a protective food, which is absolutely here, involved zero, that we can nourish from vegetables, maybe not the ones that will be wearing a stone, but things might be that, in fact, we can't use what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the bones to produce us at home, any of us can self-protect them.
I'm a winning product.
It's a part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, we had more food consumers of the exact location: about 35 years ago a law stops us from regaining them.
But it's a food that also ask chefs to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, it's enough to know how to do it: to save your lunch lanes at home, it's enough a small packaging, a great development of lighting producers in Italy, and we are some countries that generate the environment at the world.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to get rid of the water, or you can pick uova, and then feed it with vegetables, and thus release food waste.
And twice a year you will have your recipe in your own spring, like an orchestra, a time of covering around an hour and then you can do whatever you want, so on the other.
Burghignon, French drivers, or richer a stranger, surely can satisfy, there's a meat from another bit of fats that has a lot of benefits, and it can, in my opinion, not only food of the future, but also food of the present.
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the living room that eat them and not that they will never eat them, certainly they require a small change of mentality and of prejudice development, so sustainable revolution, I am convinced that it can be at the door of any of you and that really riches a small change.
Protected in theattoo, changing the way to see all the ingredients and benefits are really many, are for our health, for our well-being.
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you. (Applause)
I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six dots, one that comes from one to the other: the other.
He went to ten faces: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you'll launch your side for ten gangs.
I'll put it on you.
But come to this game, let's put an equal or largest number of mine.
Great!
six to five.
Otherwise, have you become the player?
Trying with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory.
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
With a bit of peace starts and a lot of lights, I realized that the Vitoria Province was approaching 75%.
And with the mental of release, my stance based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portal must deliver to release in about 100 million data in just one second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the risks in mathematical problem, is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
But a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Whispering) Now let me give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which I was so streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
(Laughter) The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary level of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and humanity, unbearable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
But I spend most of my time alone on front of a computer or on a statistical background.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
Well, here in movement, there's a topic that's built on a channel for a mathematician who studies west, but I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than we would do: to parallel.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how tight you think, teach Maths and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I had left before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't want to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I joined the opportunity, I started to live directly of lessons in education, I wasn't based on a preparation of loneliness, I had compassionated my students, engaging them and having fun, trying to enjoy all opportunities, I got a diploma, more than twice, in more advanced moments.
(Laughter) The fathers were the job positions, more than so much efficient, strong and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
But I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Preparing with the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I really like to run out the grades: read the students' reads, rightly mistaken that they are, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman.
(Laughter) What about the wow?
Every partnership, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) Around the students who paid for my whole bill, and I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
But, during the third year, there was also a specific recognition: the University of World Rick gave me the award for the ingrimage, as a young researcher.
(Laughter) In the cost of my PhD, I got so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
But everything was so natural, beautiful, closer.
- No.
But in my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into place.
At that point ...
I have to check everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to that question on the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, that fuel, that dissemination?
But for the place I was given, it was my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
Is there a concert?
Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits.
There is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind will be in motion when I was trying to put in motion the lies of my students.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Applause)
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great.
But the university is not the only place where mathematics and communication meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But are we going to see?
We've also told this capital of my story, because I think that what I've learned is shared.
The Monte Calla's method, for example, is to undertake a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or to find finality and motivation, there were no expectations, as catalizers of our talents.
And the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a preparation of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
What about the time?
I land the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise I've prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
(Laughter) A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some instructions about women's questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night watching the friends of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a model, they could have instructions.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had been practicing it for a long time, but there are plenty of materials online, and we have to find it written on the rear of the scarce.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
And I scratch to the washing machine, but often an animation to ask them how to procedure, to each point in practice, we would need a theory element, that we repeat the stages together, someone asks a very difficult question, but I had the dinner of their gender book, they were well prepared, I had the cavity.
(Laughter) I stand with them to make them take the spiral.
It's then saying, "Waw, I'll encourage you to the magnifying glass for the exam."
(Laughter) A group of students breastfeed, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
Behind, my last student approaches me.
And I'm solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
And finally ...
It was too courageous, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to tell you, thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
That maybe I'm only in the classroom, it's a huge smile and a bigger heart, and I think, it's exactly what's in my place to this world.
So, this is what I want to tell you: mind and heart are connected safe, and for this reason.
When the mind in motion, even the heart, the battles fly inside the pitch, it's the mind runs in movement, thanks.
It's a physically starting in November 24th, 2003, during December, there was a "Selfie" and supported by the friendsist the support of Bafco, we took a selfie and shared it, #Movender, Trento, in Trento, in Tedarch Cirento, finishing research on the corner of the prostate, in more than 219 million dollar, and they started to promote dialogue, and the world campaign, and now, this is a global movement.
Good afternoon everyone.
Today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my prosthesis about leadership.
CR: In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book.
It's like often a captain, while I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me done by others, started to listen to different conversations, then there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It's a central topic: Samatina my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
your diversity.
If you feel diverse, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with diverse intelligences.
One of which has more intelligences and you're there to mix and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in reality, it doesn't just know how to go out, and the opportunity seems right here, instead of diversity, that is how to integrate...
Everything that has brought a different background, remembering my daughter one day.
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so, at some point, we were dinner and said, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, Carlo, are we really three men?
And she says, "No, no, her two, you know with mom."
I guarantee you this: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
Now, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the right thing.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
And this is the difficulty a little, but, because if I want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders, change, that I've worked for many years.
In companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
It's not the immediate thing.
The most brilliant leaders do this: So, always drinking this cake, at some point it started to write, I'm always in the United States to write in a paper.
The word change thanks to this word change, I'm giving a thought that I don't know how many hours and I start putting into other words: transformation, creativity, until then, in this case, to play.
It starts to put together these words and form an act: hunting.
Great!
that in reality is a prison, it's a bit of achievement that, for me, of course, is a prosthesis of personal entirety.
A leader today must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: the hunger is an act, it's to know you're creative of transformation and change.
What's the new setting here?
For me, at least, the increase.
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, in management.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the prospective change that ...
But what I thought, to take this leap, to do things, to fulfill good things, to do a project, to pay the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and in this way, there is a transformation that also transforms you?
To what, to the development of creative thinking, which brings it a little?
What makes this transformation move?
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A bit of the ability to dream: to this model, we've imagined it later, through five years.
The fundamental pillars: the first one would know about transforming.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something related to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may be in their houses in marketing, rather than communication, but creativity is something that everybody has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can celebrate your simple creativity, in the morning we started with a tunnel, with brainstorming, and that's one of you that allows you to fulfill your life.
Creativity does something with creative thinking, trying to work on divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but this is not enough.
We need to take a leap and ...
Doing a slightly deliberate movement, right?
Let's start to involve that which is the emotional part, the frame of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
This is, to precisely encourage the absence of sex to your emotions.
Those forts, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
Here's the fear, that when you feel you're not brave, and you have to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's also those, when you know about your emotions, you can let yourself support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that to do this.
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a modification of fear, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, consciousness of the two emotions leads you to do this.
Transformations.
They observe, as they say, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is exactly what you have to work.
to create in a responsible way of people.
Opportunity: Let's say that I manage to create cylinder, but in reality?
I'm not so much for the idea of managing.
But how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is to support the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and this is not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were collected in one way, just like it, but dare!
It's an opportunity to build a climate with its own actions.
I also have the opportunity to do what?
To explore new definitions.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
Well, there's a simple competition here, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, better than I say it, better than I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins, and what's interesting when we get to this situation is: "How am I doing?"
It allows me to collect creative spirit.
That's it.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact that necessarily ...
It doesn't laugh if it's an organic compound, even if it's a very common relationship to re-invent a very customer relationship.
The prosecutive is completely changed, so to get back to that original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
So the sense of attention we have seen in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking, but this assumes clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all.
The thing of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
And then that's it.
So, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to land.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
So there's the chance.
to see from above.
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
of the man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Check it out!
These places to be together are mass.
They can live not all separated, but together.
It's like...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better?
Placing this phenomenon?
The limit.
And this is a story that goes back in time, actually this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it doesn't exist, and in fact, in this city.
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and they became quite famous.
Kar Marx is his friend Hang.
They were practicing for Mancester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They were stripped, without daughters.
Besides, it's a bucket.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
It was called "the conviction."
The classroom operated in the city.
When they accused the city of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city of being.
It's the cause of inequality, of insecurity, of poverty.
And there was no other way.
What limiting this phenomenon was possible to say?
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Behind, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
Nacquevo!
Also, the discipline of tools to limit this phenomenon, I realized that it was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendous one, maybe you've ever heard about, which has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you changed it at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then ...
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or even in the end, the Zonization that fortunately you haven't met all, but who has even managed to say?
Is it worth imagining?
In a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot against the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manatta?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It has a prison where all the world's challenges are launched by the upset and can be scanned for you.
But what's interesting about this process?
It's that, like all the processes, this leads to adventure a little lungar from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
Otherwise, I'm a member of science.
This feeling is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
We know that the city is not the cause of all the world.
Under the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution.
All the big questions related to the human being.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
The security is the economic development, the work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Knowledge.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The mentors that motivate this ability than the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, can you see what myallels are?
My photo was taken from the upshots of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities?
Imagineations that can be in the same method.
Both more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
To be richer, people from all over the world, people call me soccer and other people who also ignore me the most famous call.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Listen to my idea.
That the city, in the end, is scared, and in some way addressed as a solution?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The bigness.
The inhabitants are all used to confront this other city for the inhabitants, for the massive, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solve.
The greatest questions of humanity?
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I have different interests.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
To be young people who have different goals.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, depending on individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
So?
A city can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Why?
Maybe right now?
After thousands of years of history, these abilities are temporary suspected.
Walter!
Magari?
Please, may you consider that right now, or in some periods?
Remember how to be.
This mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
These measures and tools of containment of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
It's the job I've been doing in the last years.
And that they are not afraid.
The Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
You can feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast!
Utopia and guilty.
The first example?
Dimila.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From that satellite.
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
What about us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving towards the city.
The idea is...
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbitical stage that every day can walk, like we do.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps, can you imagine?
It's a element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
The first sentence of the city's solution as locals.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have in mind those who become.
The second example is now that.
a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do with this city in 2030 with all of them happy?
Buenos Aires, more than in others.
The País is the magnet.
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed, was in some way untouched.
Violence, poverty also derived from a higher national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
It limits development.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
The ability to believe.
In the power of this mental weapon.
What are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do Zyo accelerate?
And what do you see as an asset?
A shelter of intensity, that is, a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician:
The creation of pedonal spaces or glasses, you can see this...
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million.
The living in the city, building...
Situing?
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency, but from all over the world and the creatives to Yunix.
Then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I hell.
That allows us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
Are you spacious?
Diver and pedonals.
And this tragedy requires together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
Do you know?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Three.
And Magai.
Sitting the location on the belt, barefoot from thealto.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
So many times.
And maybe?
Are you very proud?
to live in what I call, the mirror of the eye.
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
It wasn't our thoughts.
The words of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They're evocating that they're full of stories, of vibrations, of emotion.
I'm his neck.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
"Yeah!"
To beauty was our language.
And it's the fact that this beauty is tolerated, preserved, perceptible.
Again.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'd like to talk about A.
Madea Montcante.
The angle: the mixture...
The idea is often motivated by darkness.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But it's been a bit long.
And I'll start to show you.
Some endless twins.
They have motivated them on their segments and the largest universities in the world.
And they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a cong, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana.
It's incodeous.
Indigenous.
In Svetia.
On the unite leg, the Kins College de Ronda, and on the united Oxford paper.
In Chicago, in the United States.
Great!
It says "You know," in your insurance.
Not just that.
(Laughter) universities.
Happyly.
Dichiaran, he's in Latin.
"Ah! I don't know
Londra has a Latin motto.
That's it!
It has a Latin motto, Canada.
There's a Motto to Tina.
Kinsler, in Australia, has a motorcycle.
But not just that.
The American Marina says, "Stop finishing, you have listened to it."
In a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even a prostitution there is no stone to be a passportist like NASA.
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a single place in the world.
In which a Latin motto could stay.
What about this?
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What is the recent marriage of the Rome city, has proven and launched the Human municipalities?
That's it.
[A.DE.]
It doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, Miandyu," "Wow, Mendyu," what is this subsidiary of allegae?
What is this contamination, this quote between two crazy lines that gives sense to each of us what are with the five pallets high?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
But why... but because when we are all the tourist attacks of all the cities in the world, there is no one who makes the insensite thing to settle their name.
I was promising.
None of them.
Just that.
"Dad, then you've got your penetration."
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
(Applause) A round of applause from the Benicuto Ministry: Look how nice!
Risconta?
(Laughter) It's not so beautiful to see, Beautiful: Let's go Italian, in an unexpected way, it doesn't like the chartphones, the curious thing is this.
Two Italian speaker: let's talk more Italian, I want to talk about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
I was from Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguists, what do I know?
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, don't do anything.
For example.
The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us.
Pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States in front of the negotiation map with the same quantity of the negotiation map that sold to hamburgers.
(Anglese) Inglese: win the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
Keep here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Lucca, meaning nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
If there's a story to promote in the week of Italian wine, of Colombian.
(Laughter) Why the distant from New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
That's it.
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
What about this?
It's what scratches the revive magician, Italian fashion.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the "winter."
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
"Please, I ask you to call."
A disorder.
Do you think it was like a mountain road in the Gran Canyon?
And no folks.
How are we in our debates?
And the women we see in ours?
Good afternoon.
Try it.
But if you see women, they're not the correct ones.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy, and it speaks English.
There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if it perfectly disappeared?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call the command, this, "I'm on the Onse."
It begins.
The radicies of the seems Catitalian.
We are segmented.
That's it.
The curious thing, why?
Or two such words: an Italian in two doesn't like an English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) And here we have to spare that the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled the sign, who has compiled this model of the island, are better than linguistic competitions.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are orto-vincial.
We use a quantity of English words.
There's no one.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The clockery is the "lockering" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We call it "competite of compilation," we say "castone" of "the ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we need to give up a shoot of toothpaste lines united from the caste to satisfy.
(Laughter) With business united.
When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because then the unit is always like, "fanco" and "gender."
The journalism and the e-mail share it not only in companies, but also in media: recording public.
The Goverde.
We have a law from the State called Jobset, and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't solve it much better.
And I have forced the newspapers in Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We would have made a house somehow.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I've added:
I had to do something: communicating my marriage, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
Fat.
Sensibilization activates this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
I'm a bit of energy.
This petition?
It invites me.
Public public records, the government!
The printers, the media, to say it.
In Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for us.
A speech from the year.
But not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting a name, a cup, a signal, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spray that the engineer has signed directors and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed meetings and professionals and called pensioners, signed up.
Italians were saying, "What are we doing with our language and they signed the story of it in Italy?"
All over the world.
Singapore, Jedus Jalemy, from Pedudal, South Africa and north Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
Open.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
"You come from qualcuna," the Italian is a duck.
But also a doarm.
We're in the soap opera, if we think abundantly, we'll talk about other tango scriptively: workers in an amministration public, help.
Not because I've studied Classic Alice, but I've worked with economists.
I've lived in fashion, I've received a deal of laughing, it's not overview of the trend, I don't think there was, (Laughter) an Italian and an English speaker, I've been better than a teenager, the English, Sisher.
And we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Cchung, go Rome's food."
The first one, for those of you, began to talk about our language decence, because I would never like to say: "Steen years is funny that occasions are spilled."
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We fail because I don't believe the one who says "cult" is "cult".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
(Laughter) First of all, I want to understand what politicians say that ask my vote.
And for now that someone will finally take this initiative, I'm 85 years old.
Thanks for the motors.
That's it.
I thought it was an extraordinary transversal echo, because in mass media, they imprisoned this thing from zero cost, on the Internet.
Does it not amplify it?
And this initiative is used.
They talked to them together, grammares and serves on the stamps of the dispublic, but they gave great applause: Italy security and sale.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
He didn't talk about Christian family, he talked about the Tuding Manch.
It hasn't spoken today that the behind him made a publishment: a transversality.
"What?"
And it's stated all the social resources, a little bit of coffee and a little here.
And that you live deeply from the testes that are more than nicks and put to the most populated ones.
And Einstein is a great wish of Russia encouraged by the Golden and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional people, and he also played to put me in the city, on the Wo Andapla and Tigi, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lion.
That's necessary.
That's it.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reasons to do it.
Afterwards, the Indian aid to make us understand and it's a fact of dismaking, because it makes us understand a fact of dismaking.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the agend, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
The mail passes.
And then.
"That doltine is tolerated!"
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonaldo himself defined "Homo Litter."
That he was scratching in vulgar, that is in Italian.
Every time.
The structure, the form of decency.
Go to the Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
We resign, express one of the pecuriities.
From its flessuosity.
What about her?
Wonderful!
Potentiality.
In our case, specifically Italian creativity.
It's the 10 in your language kills.
What's more, if our linguistic thesis is "forte," normally, we can bring some strange techniques, why personality?
But we have to put it inside a thesis that is not fulfilling.
The logo, the logo.
As a result, I used it to an excess.
Finally, nothing, misunderstood.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
I started to see if I was still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young woman, like everyone went to school, I ran and fought with friends, but what is behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the dead part of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back and reclaim...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who is able to record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
They haven't called the health problem, and when one in two parents hits, and when you're still a child, the teenager, they're your points of dissemination, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
Carbon, for a child, can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harm, fear, rage, sadness, love, hate that they change, you return home, to walk around the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
And the difficulty to focus?
And also the need to take care of domestic gangs, like sponsorships, or knitting fans, are slightest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But in addition to this, you could manage barriers and their emergencies, where no one has prepared you, how to manage the situation while your father or your mother saw many things that weren't psychologists.
Or to have to do with alternating in depressive manipulations, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, paying attention to suicide attacks.
But how do we add all this?
Furthermore, we also have to live all the time, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that we add another goal.
That many times we can't talk to anyone.
There's science.
That your mother or Tovaban, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will hear it for that, or will remind you of parents' problems or deaf people.
It's hard for somebody to consider you as a genetically committed, and destined to automatic is to edit the same discourse.
But if I tried to say, "Hey, what about your mom or your grandmother?"
They have a great entertainment, a bipoly disorder a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Even today it's not perceived as a common good.
Living to all of us, and this brings a way to understand what happens inside of you and your love, a message to ask and receive, many times, not receiving a cure, and for you that if your children, the load, becomes even more heavy.
[A.DE.]
The weather that we perceive around you is difficult to communicate inside you and then the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the embarrassment can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside fear, rage and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to pull, that no one from the school imagined.
When the first grade started an extremely beautiful, in that horn, when the first time the light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consulte that the first person came out of the family, the one I had the chance to open and that helped me, of course, to see people sitting around me the certainty that could be of supported.
Later on the Internet on the forum, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things my parents had gave me.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
But it's statistically impossible, in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to be one, that there is no other we've experienced the same things we've experienced.
And do you know why it happens, why not talk about our children's stories?
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path by myself, and I went to an immense owner, the desire is that no kid, adolescent and young adult, had to feel just when one in the business starts suffering from a psychic disorder, their view, the story I've experienced, but also the story of writing, to meet them, these children, to talk to them, and it's a owner I've lived, and it's a gad that I've experienced, and it's a gad that I had strongly spirituals, but also a gift of spirituals, to bring them, to write them, to bring them, to write them, to give them, to give them, to write them, to give them, to give them, to give them, to write.
As not to risk again to draw the weight of the world all around my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017 with other children, Italians, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to start the first Italian association, children for other children, and it's called "Comit, Pushle, Noffmentaly, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
We've given the way to a project that has gone from the bottom, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room right now, who have grown up in this same desire, they have given us the influence to start, from parents' children, with a mental disorder.
At first, when I thought about this project, I was detailed: I would never make it realised how I would do it and find so people in civil society who probably didn't experience this experience, who wanted to become our own posts in the change and bring a member of the mini guida in the owner of our community's library.
And now we've managed to get to so many regions: from the Dark Side, to Sicilia, to Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach all of them; and the other wish we have is that I believe that we must stop the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
You can have a box of atoms to make front of you.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the shifts of life, being disappointed, even if it's too bad to save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
Mamm.
It was one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that parents with mental disorder have is willing to change their scope; and that's why I know that the boys will make them fulfill their desire, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open to us, and let's use the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Aron Smart.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category: it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher; I'll surely play a hacker in a sense of sound.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
(Laughter) Over 14 years ago, they were in a group that read the hers, maybe you don't say much, but it was ugly in the framework until ten years ago.
And it began, at 15 years old, the creative people, who were responsible for the technical part: today, the creative Commum is around a world full of contents, are free licences, make the most flexible and open copyright.
I am, for example, Wikipedia license.
After 20 years, I became a small start-up to build something that co-founds something called a network, and becomes a millionaire from one day to another; Aaron, honestly, didn't freeze so much money and fame, it continues to do what has always done to build a open and collaborative internet library, with digital memories.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high school law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do monopoly.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years ago, all the messages, the economy, the history of education, information.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
Later, and this is what I tell you about doing it at a very touched moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
I tell her mother that, at some point, she was kicking her, and an air had two and a half years ago, was killed in the segelone and had her avenue on the fridge she had just attacked me.
The calamite.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents memory, the RSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creators of Commos are a copyright, so they make it accessible to people.
And the content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
Power training that we basically think of a second, we're everywhere, we're in schools, libraries, and universities.
Information as it said from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information from people mean...
Which means creating a democratic level: our democracia, literally, is based on giving access to education learning, without this, there is no democracia.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this?
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
What if all institutions are social?
They are people's facts, so fundamentally they're culture, so they're fundamentally made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
Nell'E.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Hazes.
Great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe, there are some universities in the room, it's an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many, big publishers.
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
And I said, "How come?
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
I had taken care of him.
Not an accident.
Of this genius, it's probably not been observed.
Does your opportunity to do that Aaron's, another one?
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
"Yes."
The aromine facts of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of hundreds of thousands of artisans of academic abuse, and it could do it, but not in this scale, they are responded to actors of computer pyramid.
About 35 years old.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first to the rest.
They stopped at home in New York.
She was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it.
What is power information?
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: No, no.
But that's not how you do it.
How nice, huh?
Now, all the tables will get out.
F.B: What am I talking about?
The next one is Fairy Eiffel.
(Applause)
You felt that you were born?
You know that the sports system is a sports system, which is a sports system, which is a sports system to charge it to the environment.
And then, how do you do it?
The line was drowned in dust to the corn, and it was the mourning.
So, how do you do it?
Let's admit, this mixture of human beings of a winter of an universe.
It's basically.
This is a bit third, the last year I thought, "When do I like it?
Do you have to know what the truth is?
The second one.
A banal thing as fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
Mass spionerform is used to spy, to control, for or first, there's another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, free, a full space, freedom of expression; actually, these things are...
These are the two places, there are things that coexist in the same way: the Internet is too complex.
To be just one thing.
And...
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning goes on.
Trying to know who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell.
And to make it hard and give the spacies.
Good afternoon everyone, so in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly with the eyes of theattoo.
It's duty.
Do you have all how many?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was overwhelming, no, it had a argument: in our gallery there are hundreds of thousands of bolts, most of them are the oldest of our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half years, then, if life was apparent?
Any other planet around one of these stars.
Very old, so very first.
Because on Earth, it could be like intelligent galleries, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, than we do, maybe we'd be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been informed of none of these intelligent civilizations.
And here's the question to close, I want to say, "Where are all how many?"
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it has become many more simple, it's that there's no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible.
I think this is a question that we've asked all of us how many, before or after, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a stelling sky.
I asked myself if, around those bright bright lights, could be planets, planets of living beings, that perhaps in that moment were waiting for my vocation, they are asking the same question, we are alone in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there is no one at the center of the universe, because there is no center in the universe, a seventh and a half ago.
Charles Darwin explained to us that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come, we all descend from an antenna unit.
Comune.
Also, finding the scientific knowledge of the existence of other worldwide countries, I think it would be a third big paragonable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two.
For this reason, well, in the last years we have probably done many things going on in the directions of a possible answer, we still don't have an answer, but we are the first human beings.
To have scientific evidence that there are pianists around other stars: this is one of the biggest identities of astrophysics in the last 20 years, 20 years ago, we would be able to suspect it.
Because we are truly moving the first steps, so we still don't have definitive evidence that one of these planets is indeed made of this atmosphere, so we can understand if, in fact, there are some statistics, that could be in our galaxy, at least a planet, so we're talking about enormous numbers, and potentially, that there are.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be testimonies in the context of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I'm sorry, I really believe that it's a real change for all of us, one of the questions that we can do, that often, in reality, is done, we will reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare religions, no, because they're incredibly far away from us, they're separated from a flight ocean, the universe really is really very big, and then I'll give you an example, a specific example, this son of my mirrors, like you to Geruno, that has become farther away.
The land has been traveling for a quarantine of years, and it has reached the stars of the Solar System, and has entered the space in testing, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km later, 17 kilometers per second.
So it's a huge speed, but I mean, how much would this enormous amount put?
This space probe to reach the bottle closer to ours, Proxima Centauri, themselves traveling in that direction.
We'd put 74,000 years old.
It's a longer time than any citizen civil society is.
It's existed on our planet.
We could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels at maximum speed.
In nature.
What an empty!
For more than four years to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that, so everything is very complicated, maybe we are not alone in the universe, but we are surely like isolated.
So in a sea of green space, and then, according to me, here is one of the things to be present when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of farms, and then the interrogative in reality that we all have, which is where all of us are here.
The fact that keeping present is time.
And we use it.
One example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand sinisters and the tip of my left hand.
And the past time between the formation of our planet, and today, four billion and a half years: these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here.
From hand to hand, there is the explosion of shape.
The dinosaurs, the multicellular organisms, the most completed on a network of billions of cells, the animals, the stars.
At the end of the palm of your hand drowning.
"Yes."
In the beginning of the last exchange, a natural catastrophic event, very likely, during this long history of life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet are welcomed, humble.
So this gives us the idea that...
This long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long journey, difficult, accident, and governed by ...
They were unbelievable, and that didn't necessarily have to bring to the origin of more complex organisms and not that we should bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
That's what we do.
In all this, where are we?
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because we know it today.
That for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been with us other human species that are no longer there, like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be shocking, incurable, compared to life times.
of the Universe.
Surely, they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they've completed a certain level of technological progress, to feed themselves, or simply get involved with harassment, they spark, without leaving.
With no track.
Then maybe this is in the universe.
Big cosmic silence that disrupts us and bothers us, perhaps a little bit.
A kind of warning, maybe it's saying something.
Life had to overcome it?
The big number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species.
From far away, let's imagine ourselves seen from another planet.
Domani.
Probably, in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
Let's think of a very young species: As soon as a seventh started to fly, to communicate on the radio, on a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived to the residents.
But the solar system, in fact, we've just put the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What's science?
And I think that closing us here would really be a bit like a fool.
As differences of dinosaurs, we have, at least in part, the chance of...
Changing, influencing our destiny.
We certainly have the capacity to feed ourselves, but we also have as I believe, and I hope.
The possibility of helping scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us to guarantee.
The long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day.
Is life on some other?
The planet is expensive, maybe in a far away future, so far as to reach other stars.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive as long as possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep access until we get this wonderful dive that fits consciousness, sorry, in case.
Piccoloped planet lost in the weapon of the cosmos.
Thank you.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of victory.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before classifies, but from the done sport and that generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that is likely...
Then, when you believe you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength.
First, believe it.
(Audience): Yes.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 Chileans that later became.
I don't know, I've joined two because the "Centro Quattro" is a few, no, I've already put together two, because the six is a number that will come back for more times, long this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All of us?
The participants, instead of running, are instead of being worried about coming the first ones.
I've come in the last few years, all of us arrive together, after these 1006 employees from Chile.
The journey is the difficulty, right now, in the first days, we're terrified in Windoka.
Up to the bottom, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, there's enough difficulties, we arrived in the desert of me, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
[A.DE.]
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has been taught me, the number six, yet: this know that becomes an important number.
This is an important number for me.
(Yes)
This is the first cover, the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 kilometers all of us, we do them during our studies, but the desert is general, the rope is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things.
Later, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a fire, or if it's time, or to do something beautiful, you have to move forward and know energy.
There's always the chance.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
FdB: How is pain?
Calm down the sun!
(Sound of soccer) You want to do it for this ghost.
(Laughter) And, in fact, you put me ... surprise... (Laughter) I don't like it anyway!
For this reason, I couldn't mold, I couldn't mold because in this station was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga, an important initiative to collect money from the fight against Roblastoma, at Roblastoma, it's a tumor.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, I before this experience, I didn't know very well its existence, and when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert because it's wisdom.
Do I calculate it?
When it was correct, or nearly, this was the beginning of the second cover, the seven o'clock of my bed, I had various problems, the brace, bruciature, the scoring sent it like this, because we had to move forward to our lunch, and it was true that it runs at 61 grades, but it was a tap that also started to roll up the ground security and the heaven, that there are many times, to be ...
(Laughter) We also feel during all of our...
Even better, during all our work activities of the invincible, we feel inhabitable, we feel...
But it's powerful, unfortunately, in the desert it shows that you are a punctuum to a punctuum, and maybe where you are not just cellulare, I invested the exact fashion, absolutely many kids to be happy, have to have the cellulare, not the exact fashion, and at a certain point in the middle of the desert, a sera that used to eat, it's closed.
Keeping from the Pummine, there's an immense fence: at this desert, it's going to take a warning from a backpack, there's the door, this wake, and says to us, "Yes, you've used it, don't know if you know, enjoy it."
And I don't know if you know that with salt I can eat.
And I don't know if you know, but what I do, medicine was also happy for the abuse.
The anamibian desert is the desert I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there's the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters away, and when you're here, we've made it of race or almost.
It's strange, you can see it there, on the tip of the bar that then split from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because in my desert it doesn't exist, it doesn't.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, only five Chileans were left.
Now we're already the Chilean, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and the real sky.
(Sigh) Sorry, that's it, two optimies, four kilometers to make us go beyond two.
MM: Yes, it's the honor, but it's full of things... I'm happy!
And nothing, thanks to all of you that are in your strength.
Guado, let's see there's no more.
And I found myself in the desert.
Although this morning, as I mentioned the small principle of my well-being, I found many people who shared with me, other than 26 people, because it's a garage.
With many contents: 96 were 96 people who had traveled with me, in the end, the last two km could also not do them, because the challenge was 104 had a long time, and in the end, a magic, an amazing magic.
As you can see, they're all very agile, I've also lasted the part because the things were a bit rigid.
So these are us because the organization that had done to a Chile far away from the front had given me the gang to give me the opportunity to come and finish the uffician cabin, then return back, take the other Chilean, and then go back toward, to reach 100 years.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to get to these years.
(Music) The melted food was over and achieved its goal, on December 20th, 2016, that if you take the figures, it's exactly the numbers that make 116 km, or even 16, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
I was sometimes captaining people to think.
And I was surely facing 100 meters and already made a big deal:
I wasn't alone.
Yeah!
Look at "Haha".
I looked at a wife that was enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who was already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six, and Pietro, and nothing.
Ricardo where to go to the fourth, and Pietro, in the first elementary, so big, I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his and Pietro Panige, of course, had already understood, I don't have life, that's it.
And a bit like that.
Like the corsa.
What I said before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
AC: This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating emorecity, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the birth, and it lowered hardly, and this is the last time I saw him smiling.
(Audience) Yes!
And...
So, when?
When did it look?
When it seemed like everything went well?
Hmm, February 18.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack.
Because it was too expensive.
So, ah!
The garage is called Ranna 1006 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Clearly not male.
I don't have it.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments?
You don't have to let go.
And it needs me.
(Applause) But you have to continue to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And Riccardo continues to move forward in life.
To give the chance to the other two that arrived: is it arrived at Emma?
Emma came on January 29th to San Pietro.
And eventually Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and I couldn't do what can manage to create or improve my life, improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visually, but above all from there.
From the physical point of view, to be able to give strength to people, and to be me stronger, and so I started running the first image you see on the record is my first marathon, the queen of a beautiful tale.
I ended up arriving, as I said, in the desert of Namibia, where these 16 Chileans brought me to win this medallion, but to help a lot of children, they also needed, and you see here the house, what I wanted to take 21200 euros.
It's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
This year in November, it was in the desert of Omanna and Chileans will be 165.
So here too, there are combinations of many - 165 kilometers completely in self-sufficience.
So they give me only the water, we come, we wait to get to the end, but the desert is diverse, but the objective is always the edge, which is to get the money to help children and help them do better, the message so that I can do this today is an important message.
Anyone is.
The difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always there is hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
in 2017.
Three times I know, come with me.
As you want to interpret it, thanks to everything.
