In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Cinglearning Forum, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born at the ICIRO.
Before, the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create environments of less formal data, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
I usually get into class the first ten minutes, when the students arrive and are seven.
I use the ego of my computer speaking and I use classic music: I think this is the first step to create environments of data that are less rational and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a methodology that uses end of quantity.
Storietelling.
At the pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to transmit knowledge to the students, and through this method, I would like to start my lesson, explaining a topic about everyone's safety, already.
Artificial intelligence.
And like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942, the UK.
Blockchain park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
They arrived at Cambridge's school.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator was outdated, but it's old to be stuck on a paper.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures to "black".
with his team.
And I built them a machine.
the one you can see.
Dietro: How can we decipher?
This test is written by AIDSC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about mental magazine.
"Computing machine learning."
Does anyone proposes testing you?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
(Laughter) Would we like another person?
that would tell her a computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a M machine.
It's a "o" operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the P. person.
(Laughter) They say that the Mouse machine is overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they get there.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is an active argument.
Both premises.
Feritire.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
It's close to building deductive arts and transferred in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people?
Initiality.
Then you must act.
It must be adapted to this.
You have to set goals, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote, can a machine to think.
We can say, is it possible to make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's about building intelligent and supported artificial integrity of man, it's a cycle.
[Yes!]
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you how to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
It's summary.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I'd like to share with you some examples: optimal agents are those who work better than all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that solve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, do you think that a young man has been rising for some years?
From the start of the Rubik cube, it was resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any month ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve in 0.63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, it's a game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the green aircraft, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, who almost like all the people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answer to questions about soccer.
We looked at the "min".
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
In the end, we have subtle people who suffer from all kinds of people, examples are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today aren't able to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge.
What's it?
Mela.
What are we talking about?
From the bus of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world, in situations of uncertainty.
These are the biggest limits of artificial intelligence in which we think that we are far from overcoming the avenue, we see now in the future.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate?
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with a exponential call.
This is a sad moment.
Sorry.
I'm prepared in the wall's law, for which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, two years ago and in a quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the test and turning.
And then?
In 2045 and the last moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change the human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against the same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
Another student at the University of Varese, followed a course of epistimology, deontology and ethics of computer science, performed by professor Gaitano in Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to do was to offer a formulated resolution with a mathematical illumination.
"What does this human stupidity mean?"
I want to describe it in simple ends, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, symbol of sound to the author of equation and transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we obtain an equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story.
Let's start with the first question: Can machines think?
Now I'll encourage you.
With an open question.
(Audience) Yes!
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) How many of you today have spoken about photos?
Craziness.
OK, OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I've called the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his own phone, which doesn't do most of me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we're talking about.
We can consider the mobile photographs a new linguistic way of influenced the issue of the vision as the forms of complication: Technology consciousness that exists.
In the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer, it still makes the difference compared to the simple gesture of premishing a smartphone.
And how does photography cells change the forms and structures of professional photography in order to find answers to these questions I tried to face a confront?
With photograpters, accurators, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflexes.
I took the photos of professionals who, for the first, already ten years, opened the challenge of this new middle, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal elections, the experts, their shared experiments, images, and through cellulare.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
at the DESC of the photo editors of New York Times Magazing, that scattered.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big community places of contemporary.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to simply belong to a global narcissistic disorder and to get involved as some psychologists have sustained with the disturb of body dismorphism and it has to rethink, simply, to a global narcissistic disorder, or it can't be seen as a safeguard of section.
Like an identified setting, as a supermarket rebuilt in its image, as it was playfully reinforced by visibility to female artists like "Kateard Ben."
To look at Scholager.
It's the financial term which has signed and still segts both our vision of the mobile.
This is my channel, Zazzi, who is the victim of my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's epidemic tastes, or, as has sustained social or storage, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
It's called "I Revolution," applied to a story of mobile photographs, because in front of the power of images we were wired to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
Let's forget because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that has shown strongly about the process of installed materials, work, family, coppy, are increasingly increasingly increasingly increasing, and here, there are intable spots in a universe in movement, sponsors of front to the average of the messages that harm them daily.
The phenomenon of the mobile photographs seems the most natural expression way.
A liquid vision that is composed, makes you compose.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What is the only professional photographer left?
And what difference happens between Western photos and conscious photos?
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
taking part in the process of democratization of photography.
I started with theera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's orchestra, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
We are trying to be a powerful tool to guide public authority and capture a source of machines and information hardly controlable from the necks. This is a picture of pensioners hunt, one shows that the "folfang" museum has dedicated to the rule of the mobile photographs in the Arab Spring.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he released the necessity of accepting a political agend, a law and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalistic priority, he has liberated it from the impossibility of reaching limited resources.
And he allows them to directly put themselves in the ranking of News, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
Like, for example, "femil photos," an Instagram accountant, founded by an American photograph, "Reche la Courniz" and dedicated to conservation of the universal heritage of family photography, in my photography and society in Novecent, or even new ways of preservation of the economical memory.
We traveled by corporational section, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by those professional and non-normal photographs, and there is a job of scaling in accantinity, in narrative, regarding a topic.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Benjamin Lowi.
Hr. VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic meteors that, starting with a simple smartphone, exploded new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Fidanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and has made a huge traffic of intimate and minimal narration of the majority of basic lines.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempt and partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
The Peter of Campo, who, through the Everest Everi Count, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African Africa, along with media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame.
It's like the Luis that reinterpreted the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, storying in the IV TV series that I'm one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history with the most new vision tool.
Or like anastasi at the Lord Linde, who has photographed the sweet manifesters in the sink, who is during the proteste of Mai Dan, with an old puzzled bronic, and contemporary has registered his cellulating the moment when the actress of the Bronic bronics sees up and is born in the image, translating this photographic experience in a pocket, between analogy and digital, a far away from the modern stream.
Well, what do these photos know how to do, that we don't know how to do everything?
To keep going to the outskirts of the action, or looking for the vision of many personal vision of the evolution, avoiding more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creatively the code of storytelling, designing in a profound and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world and the quality of impact.
Because anybody is the pregnant recovery tool.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a coherent manner.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
That's all I believe.
It also does the difference between a photograph that was reinforced in real life, its reproducing bowl, its self-reference and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
You feel this.
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
In 50 thirds, they entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
An email.
It doesn't exist.
So also in this room, those employees, these signs, and put them home after a really stressful job magazine.
Even better, you compete with your partner, in case, and then you'll get up on your bedside in your bedera and think of being on its own, and instead not.
There is not always the law.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
We have a positive side: Or better, I leave first from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We're never alone, in other words, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50/30, which accompanies us.
Great, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50 hectares is nothing more than a sounding circle, a sounding circle with a beautiful richer space, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
What about my parents?
They enjoyed when I was a child.
Well ...
I know it, you may think that this is the classic strappalous story, but instead, it was the revelation of my life because in the solitude.
During those days, in the burden, in that house, I started to play music with everything around you, so ...
Each boundary of roots was no longer.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But this is my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
I say, at some point,
I started to become a normal person, trying to say.
So I started studying yesterday.
It's the pianoforte.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started smiling the Clarinetto, the problem that Arenzo Arvor really liked, who wrote a personally ambiguous song, was bringing it to the first years of genetic studio.
I also helped Clarinetto.
But it's good for not to leave.
My classmates are easy to illustrate.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to sponsor it.
What's the problem of life?
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the rumor made us grow much more.
And of a smile.
So here's my mission.
Even when there are children, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music.
It's to harmonize everything around me.
I'd love poetry, right?
It was a great turn of dollar, Gino Paoli.
And everything would be conclusive, but no, my life was complicated in this world.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
That's the study, it's harmful, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion: our inner eye, the catalogue of the musicians, our team, reaches the maximum functional around twenty minutes of gestation.
This means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching, and this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
To what speterns in life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture, shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So no, in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco Britannic, there's no need to be stupid if the child, one day, was born.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else, OK?
(Applause) What is it, but what is sound?
Well!
The sound is this ...
It's all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
Boys the son's column every day, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom scratches us, and not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
In a small town, what?
Picola for the men of Mility.
in a small town in San Pietro.
"My smallest house in your house, maybe?"
It captures the same as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me.
I imagined higher, well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So?
Through this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try one.
Imagine our life, I would like to assume your ability to observe, then we are in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we start to...
To take a photo to the feet, to the wisdom, then to the background, and then to another perspective, then it's photo from the bottom, it's not done, but we also make those, then there's an aperitivo, so we take a drone to make a photo: Chilean, zero, Chileans aren't, I've lost it, but it's multicannal, multisensorial, but it's multimultural, very proud that it had a certain point in which you know.
"Food, well!"
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I'll show you a thing: when do you tie to someone?
The best moment, in order to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others: it goes anyway!
Listen.
Fermarvi?
What about listening?
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, would I like to take you with me?
Right to the world, hooing it.
your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born.
What about harassment?
It's from me.
It was in 2013, I wanted to go far away from school for the first time the school of myself, a series of failures, problems and others.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I wrote the plant: yes, it's true.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artisticically, it's really far away from me: Shanghai, decided to participate in a competition, an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, just because I was listening for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only growing, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of the whole world, of all cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the city's sidewalks, the cities are a great musical tool, in order to welcome this musical instrument, you can enter the heart of the city.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a sound column.
So, at this moment?
I want to swallow you.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've been photography differently, and you've become more than once, but that smoke that fits tombs, but the bridge of Brooklyn can resonate.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
Everything is completely in the leg.
and the desire to resonate with others.
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was another part.
It's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you ...
You know a bunch of posts.
In this photo ...
The drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
(Laughter) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds gave me data of these children that in this tube.
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Then, and now that is elaborated.
And this is not.
Salt, to the span of...
(Audience) Grandma.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
It's a big deal.
It's in the lab.
OK, Genova is "Mr. Zandis" (Laughter) And I wasn't totally lost, that's one thing would be.
Anyway.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Junt of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical instrument, and it helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
Then, the last one, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
The cheap of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I cry.
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become the core of the colony.
This is the rock sound.
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova at hand.
I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
Almost with our passions, in my and in your lives, and for the way people will tell you that they are rumors, stupid.
For a long time, she really wants to hear her, and I thank you for listening, thank you.
As Guy Beck in Italian said in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in such as the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution, to benefit, a lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to restitution what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say: nothing works, then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post a 18 minutes shared some of this story.
It was around Segrate, and in the same year, my wife Monico organized the funeral school to pay the asylum's school: it was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some people said no, because we need to help us think about what was the common, but most of them were these extraordinary teams.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
But it has taken a billion 200,000 to read, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro, then, and it was an extra effort of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similarly, the same school at the next school is active, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
Which means the gameback of restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole of society, not that the American society is perfect.
Both.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've been lucky, I'm regained, I help the school.
Besides the university, through the museum, along the theaters, there are all the communities that can sustain voluntarily live with restitution of volunteers, not that we don't have an inspiration, because here it's a phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are also thechanisms, there are physical visits, there are the processes, it works, it's not based on this.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker, who says, "Desiste Miss Done is now."
We are already expecting a lot.
But actively, they ask, "System is one of the moment."
Obama well-known baking lotter, and it was an incredible technological debt.
technological boats, there are often 100 million dollarians, so not worried about these things, they don't only happen in Italy: they build a seat that doesn't work.
A lot of millions of content, and this is the standard answer that we've got, shortly, you think you don't finish for some day, but then someone has stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it, to start criticing, which is easy and normal for us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Let's raise awareness of the technologies that were sent by Google, other companies, there are fert, and agree with the white house, not riachitty, has put a role in the seat, in just a few weeks, there's one third of the costs, where probably many would be criticized, but Google probably has the interests of this.
"Yeah!"
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without being very interesting, and that's what...
I'd like to explain to you about what it was like, the spirit of people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives, experiences.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
[Pubblic: Ripetibles.
And make them again reproduce and scalible.
It's to create a replicable system that is the MIUS of Torris, from this effort that has been born.
A replicable system is what we expect to do as well.
But I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, the ones who have taught perseverance, the desire to never change, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
But, of course, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
"Yes."
I wanted to do it.
From Worldview, there's no way.
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Things later, we're five to meet Materence without Francesco, and he came to business in the Silicon Valley, sensitive to the need of transformation in general, to those things that have enabled us to a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of public recording public, asked me why he couldn't help us during an year's trip for a couple of years: I think, we reflected, the payment with my wife, Monica, and talking to my capo, Jerpeso, in order to make it short, I decided to apply a methodology to find out, I couldn't, or I could, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't give up, or can't get informed, or can't get informed.
But the choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years.
A welcome...
Ah, puzzle!
But those who do it as an Amazon, a robot, you know, but from something you'll underwater, these are only many slums, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but at a positive side there was, I've been, I'd mentally focused on the chotting and the bureaucracy, but I'll take the chance of these disguises, and that I didn't expect, of course.
But scientism isn't often cinism, that you throw you a certain mentality, you don't meet it, obviously you do it because you have your teachers, I feel many of this kind.
This country, in truth, lack a lot of sense of common good.
about doing things because I thought of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, like an acute commissioner, and I say this because it's the brutal title, my children gave me a revolution from the beginning of an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume some people from the public administration list.
The only thing I asked you here is: since the systems from the inside don't turn into each other, we want to try to transform them with people outside, where the fact that we don't know public administration is a sign, not a reliability, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so there's also 25 people, a number.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations, around 80 percent, 20% hopeless to perform judicies, legals, and communication governors.
Here you see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, "Why don't we write?"
What I think will happen.
In this way we want to attribute such, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to make us, even temporary, to a compound, probably much better than what you see, as I invite you.
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other reason, maybe some of you recognize it, that closed photography of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone's children, all the United States, in this massive sport, in terms of investments and infrastructure?
We created the vision.
The country operational system, a series of fundamental components that can be built more simple, efficient for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
The vision of beauty, the introduction, is decrime and blood.
I've continued in my place, a field of business in salt, but that American future, if I don't agree.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of you will say, don't know how public record works, we've already proved in many, in Italy it doesn't work.
And I continue.
But we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and biased.
Well, the criteria of the first type will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and we have many treatments.
But the second guy, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always use bicycles.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is our problem: to motivate things that don't work.
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the Times magazine cover.
Here's it.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible, the people among the groups, I got around 3,000 questions, of which, at least a hundred decidenly qualified hundreds, we used digital tours for the chores, an app called Jazz, we put it in Jazzle, we put it in Gazzle, we put it in gender in the Govern Sea, and we did a mathematical test and a thirsty of the Internet.
In fact, we deal with "draulics."
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should be interconnected, it's silos that they don't know.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their suffering and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
The software profile, of course, is to do so many activities of management, so much more identical activity.
But we can't also have the choice: to make the flames in time, you have to make them improve the autistic interaction, doing more simple things, all these things are done in parallel, but without your threshold you can't do the chest.
(Audience) Yes.
After a few months, during the period of 2017 we said, "The System triends the publication, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in pharmacy, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
The first time it was...
Sound and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole affirmed the decreto of the present as minister, the digital transformation is a city priority of the government, the trendal piano plays a team game to simplify the publicity of the citizens, particularly the piano.
It's been newspaper once in the year, because the kids couldn't have been, there are mainly technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
But what is this, is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
The recovering the technological rules and connections must probably be paid of visits and connections to other floors on the other side, and at some point there are the technological rules that are quite unbearable: unfortunately, we can't talk to the administrators themselves, the technological ones they understand.
Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the population platforms, the digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in spontaneously all the activities of the recording public, and the more they will be.
Digital payment is one: digital payment, electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
You will be able to implement technologically all the data of your citizens that at this time are around 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the one with synchronized database.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk about the rest of the administration applications: when I come across a community to the other side.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago and a week ago we made an Akaton.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
Bag-fixing, so, putting up some software problems.
A improvement of documenting and even new projects: all this conflict that we're talking about sustainability and replicability of the beautiful space of technological perspective, as far from the University, was done in 25 Italian cities, without even São Francisco, but there are many Italians that are helping us.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that basically don't get limited to make an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it serves that the builds are composed, unknowledged me, this might be, for example, and it's one of those things that will increase the alsa version, alpha, it's called digital citizenship, it has the phone.
Smartphone has the digital identity, data has the card of electronic identity, Nepsi.
It's already functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction between citizens and public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because work is really doing it, but it has to be in this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
With the next 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens, I took the chance to write an article I want to cite you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it.
We design a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rules and not the institution.
Being a country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, hoping to embrace it.
A country with high technological competitions is also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine a country where working for public recording is an wealth, where the children in the better way to work in public research centers, that are seen and proper centers of eccellence and innovation.
that leads development to the country, to feel that it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this digital process policies, technological processes are really many and maybe too many, but if it's not a dream about which we can hardly be able to do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
(Audience) Yes!
And here it's been taken somewhere in this theater among others, to this point, but it's easier, and in a site I managed to explain what I'm doing.
[A.DE.]
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Tini Times to become Digital, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our dream is our social, thanks.
And what if I had the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
What would you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know there, then raise your hand if you'll change some of your body, maybe you lose some thread, or maybe you'll save your muscles.
(Laughter) I was sure that I wouldn't have all of you, or maybe you'll be among you who will change partner.
(Laughter) Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't understand if I changed, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have a more united family, but my parents didn't separate.
(Applause)
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
(Laughter) Being the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the market and work, and the first part of my life I spent fighting and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't work well, from what others thought of me, the great economical sides, of the interpersonal relationships.
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefits, but if the majority of the things that happen, were the only three signs of playing in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a good thing, but they ended up maintaining their problem in life.
(Audience): Yes.
The strategy, today, the broadcast, is to get lamented, we get lamented a bit of everything, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, that makes fun, that I'd have done it differently, we regret because there's no injustice, and it's going to mankrupt.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who wasn't doing anything but to get bothered, from when I started to talk, and then the boys with whom he translated her, so the fact that she didn't have a job, the ultimate ship of the government that didn't help her, sat with a value, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized her during her daily life.
Because getting worse, for all of us, is a little like this.
Because with a small effort.
Then we obtained a big result: to restore the victim's role, which is listened, comforted, helped.
(Laughter) Anyway.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
Da alone or with friends, at a high voice or in your mind, you can remember something that is already suited or something that might happen one day.
And you can lie to your tea, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
(Laughter) But the truth is that as long as you're forced to lament yourself hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what hurts you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, is that of lamenting, assuming that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Later to the luxury, another very exciting strategy, when things are stretching, it's that of imporciation, it imposes our need.
(Laughter) In the basis of this mentality there is a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't okay is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being, what surrounds us, doesn't you like bearing?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
Do you feel a bit ugly, but why never be in suffering, take two pillars and solve it easy?
The wife breaks you, divorces you.
In the fresh lights we can all know how much rising it is.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
It's too big not to take it up, send it to the psychologist: we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, to make the world around you enter the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I wasn't doing anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
It's certain that you can conceive yourself, but not even to prepare yourself in a grade, which is a classicone, but it, right?
If you who never asked me if not for that, and he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do another way to get me uncontrol, and that's how, in the end, a strong iron-looring arm that always starts with the same stream word.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old.
Instead of removing the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy they privilege.
When things are not going like wearing, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result, think about a couple of times, because you will have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there's no way a tool to take the forehead, put it underneath.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the deserve of necessary needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that the time was openly driven in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned some important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to rethink about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but the other part never learned to say no to the things they didn't care about, I didn't learn to say no to the things they didn't care about, and the need to count how many.
It's the strategy that privileges when things don't go as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, you'll finish to disrupt them.
(Laughter) Sading, involving your needs or hanging them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in the middle of my meditation, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the spedal for which I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuccelli, here for her, there's no more space, it's pleased to keep the collapse with us, to accept a disturb.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most, or if everything had to go there to do a job that neither there was a big deal with all that I had studied until then.
I've heard about dying, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing yourself.
What if I had changed?
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
And if I became a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, the primary school wouldn't send me a way, and if I had done it, things wouldn't harm me more than so much, but perhaps I would be left before the immigration.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
And why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do?
He goes to the agreement of choosing us.
And choose you.
What's the cause of things?
that they don't leave as a path.
Think about yourself as a cause of things that are not going like to happen.
This is our bifth.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
Now, I'll find myself and help to confront something much bigger: I mean, it's the harp of the crisis, that maybe there's a margin of change, which then improved, then you open the doors in front of you, because it's sharing your responsibility, the counter, then you always decided to learn a new language, to read books, to acquire new skills or consolidate those that you already have, you can work on you, to become a journal.
But because life is from those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
(Laughter) If things don't go well in the coppy, you think it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It is sending them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
Then, what can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
And then things change, but they don't change anyway, but they change because you know you've changed, you've started searching for your needs.
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war.
Now, if you're one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, national prostitute, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a standard of the table.
It's starting to work on me, considering the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to warn to be a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value to their lives.
But my friends, I met a couple of ...
What about the problem?
Stereots, prejudices, obsession is the doctor of the mates, homicile is the doctor of the debts, but had to talk to a friend, but went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
I had to get lamented or maybe not to explain how many good psychology I would have to try to change their mental priorities, I had to give up my dream: no, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of having mine.
It's the turn of ...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube.
But in which I spoke about psychology, here for the crack, I'm talking about collecting ants, because maybe, you think...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm from 1979, published psychology in Italy, went to my magazine, and what left me more than anything was recognized that the bonds, at the beginning, a bit strange, came back ...
It makes me leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbium they've been read to the president of theorder.
I had dreams.
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps you hold and makes you move forward, the ones who don't know how to build and need to reflect, because the culprit should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
Well, if there's something I've learned from all my journey to improve.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For this reason, I've asked you a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't work like you?
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
(Laughter) Well, in chiusure, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least prove us, it's a small question that I personally was very useful, and that is based on the logic that, in order to produce great changes, it's about concentrating in many actions.
Well, what's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put ...
Your life in the direct?
It auspiciates.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions that are both?
And that's it.
"Ah, you had a fruggler's tea!"
The ugly to asso, left the pulman, right?
BB: Where do I put the packs on?
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I hold my hand, I steal the leg.
Or on her feet, which is now about mutating?
I did when my mother came.
But do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself, here.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
So, of diverse and diverse abilities.
And the percussions are so fast, so immediately, they take up the distances and join the battles.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
Seven kids, I see, I see, Laura, Paola.
By the way, I saw them grow.
And our provides were marketing.
The Friday was the day of protest, where this room was entered in the school of Andreoli.
(Laughter) They were picking the first bidonies, they were together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become part of the band.
CR: From there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw the first ones, the first weddings in the groups, the first satisfaction, the first meetings.
The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Soundly?
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
In the real sense of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
And as I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many believe that our living provides, our place where all marriages were completely different.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
You have endings and roles.
We've done it.
Luckily, we all found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of demonstrations, of thousands, inside that tunnel.
There were magnificent things.
And we've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth that washed, to find a smile.
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubophons that have become?
The tools built and combined with ping pong roots, to take off with big ones and if you cross.
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, there was always an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
[A.DE.]
Already there is born our first spettacol.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we stayed, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men, and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards.
Do we do it?
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also display a moment from our land.
to breathe for a moment.
After the year, we cracked, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow.
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tendency.
And no one of us would have ever thought it's a stone?
It could change our lives, but we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
(Audience): Yes.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first master?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
It's the kindergarten stage.
We haven't really done so many.
And they also give me feedback, because that's exactly me.
It's the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also.
from freshness, there are so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream comes?
Realize in reality.
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
What is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, I'm actually born as a researcher, until I realized what has happened in the last 250 years.
250 years that have changed our history radically, and that we live nowadays, we talk about social innovation and my question: What is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
However, these three factors together, joining mobility, make us a technological evolution that belongs to the industrial revolution, we all carry around us, an animal, I believe almost everyone, and the computer belongs to the internet revolution that we are living today.
Then, let's understand, then, what's happened in these 250 years, that replace the industrial revolution, the Internet and the Internet, the vindas to the Internet, we remember it as an iron.
What was my studies?
The school book, in fact, wasn't only an iron: we, at the industrial revolution, we're extremely debated, we're usually debates, for example, because we need the motorcycle to win.
And the vapore mask is not only a vapore mask, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored and resembles much faster, the carbon estation, and the rising possible to a significantly lower cost, and the rising possible has a significant impact, and it started to change the modality, but it didn't make it.
But we don't only need the motorcycle.
We also need to wear glass motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanan invitation, it's an Italian invention, the scoppy motorcycle.
We need, for example, the automobility industry.
In reality, first, it was used in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motor that couldn't go from far away, when I was able to understand how to get off that belt and get it from the belly and adjusted to the scent that developed the automobilical industry, and all that was originated.
But they are not.
And for the Industrial Revolution, we still have discussions, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, from one part to another of the world, ever smaller than we knew.
But it's also what permits us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
Sottile sea.
And yes, because after the phone, we could try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
Let's interrupt everything.
No, if I went on, having caves under the sea, the first cave to give a storic dimension was removed from artists between mess and artistic artists, not just two people who agree, but the first cave joined there.
And we're around 1858.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another invention is electric energy, the first continental electric power in Europe was built by Sant'Adeconda, where Rinascente Milano is.
Today, the idea is that a while in 1873 is built the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
It's part of our history, it's swimming from I.
But let's move forward, we try to make rooms that has still been through, but that has already experienced important features and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to leave something, to compose something that has never been in the first history, among the writers that in the beginning of the 50s could simply be quicker, the calculation.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, he decided to open these landmares' releases, but he didn't know how to land all over the earth, but he was so terrified because they hadn't known, but in those 50 years of the Internet revolution had happened something else.
And these responses, called ARPA, ARPANET network, became and started to be the World Web that we know.
A system diffused, orchontal, non-archical, extremely captured, is able to bring information to collect information and were 25 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
But when the functional strength, which was replaced, which was introduced by the industrial revolution, started to disrupt artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
And the Internet had theoca that, if little by little, we started to live theoca that we've lived now, that we're living now, that which is called by the Internet, and this according to a phenomenon of creativity, of creative education.
Because of course, it's an industrial process that tells us that what's new gradually distruits what's old, because it needs to make space, and we'll see better then.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions, but there is a story that is a little more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which we start to reflect, to accompany you.
It was 1863 when, from the scale, it wasn't the Italian yet.
Minister Minghetti, put an end to Inghetti, established that 27th century of the judge is correct, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing small ministers, I'm introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce goods that were necessary in their surroundings.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most of all, it has transformed the economic power of the power of production of goods and goods in the power of producing one.
Well, the report.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to keep in mass media, in structured way, in a healthy way, in the quantity of food, which is the frigerator.
So, there is a chance, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the emergence of everyday life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
In the meantime, as we said, the speed, the speed of the actions, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there is a number that has characterized these years, which is a element that we can define as the qualificator of these years, the speed of our thinking, which is not at all detailed to the thought, but we are very fast.
But until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900 and 2001, when we can say that the 20th century has finished, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that are significantly segmented in the passening of one another, 2001 and 2001 because in total.
And the American economy started to slow down, and there were Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, began to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were strings to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
Instead, there were Europeans who were to fail, the police already is the dream of failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, it changed something, but what has changed, has changed the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
But let's not wait for the biggest economic crisis, which, effectively, was verified in 2008; it was crazy not to think, but how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension, when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would be left: we were certain, and we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are potential multinationals, in most of them, but most of all, all the companies that have been after 2011, what did these companies do?
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
And the adventure, the idea so often denied, according to five actors, the connectivity, is nearly close to a fast connection between 50%.
Anything already, according to human abilities, human resources, the ability to heal, to a distant being between empty competences, abilities based on what allow us to flow from formatical systems, digital systems, those advances, those that allow us to develop them.
And a third photographer we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
It's a third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The public minister system immediately touched the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the present of two important things, there are all five elements that are in a growth and at a speed of completely growing up up until two years ago, so we are reaching European countries, and this doesn't mean anything.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to watch with much attention, that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the abilities and the inclusion of the digital in the productive factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country: we have two engines, the first motorcycle.
It's what's done greatly in the '50s and the pictures of the walls.
Let'songe on being the smallest printing media, something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't paragonable to large internationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
They're starting to do something extraordinary, "Made in Italy," they have a quality, an eccellence in the production of service, in the production of products, which is quite united in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire insistently competences inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can be used.
It's an interaction of the market, extraordinary way, creating ricks for all the things around you: a nature's heritage, nature, nature, nature, and this is the first asy we have, the first great motorcycle, the second motorcycle that in the hospital is her cultural artistic heritage.
The headlines, how can tourists live only three cities?
Venezuela, RA and then Remember, and we're learning, maybe we've started to start, but we're speed to recover, to include this patrimony within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it to black and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
The topic I spoke about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word that unites.
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
(Laughter) With a question: What if someone asked you?
In Bruccia Pelo, according to you, in the last 15 or 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens have increased or are decreased.
But I believe the majority of you would answer were increased, and if I asked you, but in Italy, the answer of many would be, too.
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the results of video.
I've prepared with my colleagues a report on inequalities from when they are data, which means, officially, from 1960 to the highest majority of countries in the world.
[A.DE.]
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality based on the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
And in Italy, the aggressive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated now we are at the storic mining.
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
AC: We have a decreasing inequality trend.
How can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is to say: we've undertaken an architectural support, because we've continued to talk about years of increase of inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
Isn't we?
And ... the feeling wasn't wrong, but the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
[A.DE.]
Maybe we need to reflect on the reasons of inequality, what we try to say about inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality requires some rhythm.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And in addition, we moved to Cambrici in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
That Cambridge added a speech in front of me.
There's a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, the first says, in that occasion, Keynes forms two professors.
It was a seventh, the product.
Then, from an hour working, you'll be...
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this profile, indeed, has been achieved, because if you're taking the rich reins of the storers of the economy, and, in most of the society, we have an increase in productivity at the age of 100 years as well.
Of course, twelve times, in some cases 15 times, so this teacher is doing to say, little to 100 years old, she would be finding a huge amount of free time that she would have taught her to work less.
She also said to her to work all the time, and when she told her that she was less likely to try a week of 15 hours of work, or a three hours of work every day.
Apparently, this second trust didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
I'm going to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first time we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not realised anywhere, let's see what happened in Italy.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
And what's interesting is that this 16% dedication to the work, through creating a job, and if we keep this trajectory, Keynesi's teacher really achieved, because at the beginning of 90% of our lives naturally workforcely, around 15 years later, when we are able to compare a job, and now we call it about 16 percent.
Two hours and a fourth a day: the three-hour neighborhood, we, in Italy, already put it on.
Naturally, if this happened, there are reasons even between 25 and 30 years, so even young age is landed, but there is a reason, maybe, more important, for our time quote.
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see that...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of occupation goes down to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income, are more than workers.
In front of this?
Facious behavior: can we also have a relationship?
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation in Italy.
Testing units.
This is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument, while we don't believe it, but it's even more impressive, and the storage number of the management rate, because here we see.
Which may have an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general assistance in the United States at the US, and in our case, we have a situation of resolution.
at the occupation rate.
(Laughter) But then, this idea of art is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I defined as a parasite dependency, depending on, because depending on Twisia's network, this to you can also be a family member or State, but sympathetic because I consume or the available edit without working.
[Yes!]
My friend, who did the theater, when I found these results, we came to the scene and I asked him, "But how did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasite dependence?"
With Epopopotam, it's the moon that lives on the backs of the hypothama, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, here, here.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves?
But the buffag or the buffag on the hypothama, or on the other great mammals, these murderers also live on the roots, on the buffs, we have this film that will interest some of them in which you see these...
Animals, these murderers.
As sociologists live, the question I've asked myself how it is: this is accepting the resources that the bug bothers, that I have a larvae, and that everything that hits on the golden gas, that I've done as a sociologist.
And society, signals, like family members in which there is a job that has placed in the conviction of living without work, but naturally, it's not enough, we must add a qualification.
That it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
(Audience): Yes!
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship between eating and submissioning, because consumers are more than producers, because consumers have become so many, and the relationship between signs and producers is much more complicated, in the sign language society is very simple, classical, we have the signs and the serves of the gumbs that produce of them.
The relationship?
And it's the buff with the hypothomo and parasitism, and this is an advantage in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food located in the hydropo plant.
And also from the view of the producers, we saw again a green friction, a green light, the Epopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need buffer, but it's somehow in an obligation, like we are in front of the colors that live on our roles, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of entertainment.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we come.
And the position of the adventure, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic, the position of the year is to be penetrated in graduation, today, maybe the only inequality in access to work there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two jobs, with the United States, a mess in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
As we arrived at this: this is the history of inequality in access to work in Italy, always measured with the efficient decent, you can see something fascinating that inequality is the mining during monarchical age, especially under the jobs of our families.
(Laughter) But here I concluded that there would be 1,000 or a month, and in addition, we'd have 12,000 euro income approximately for more than a year, and our state would have 15 billion euros to spend, as much as the sanity and the massive school together, more or less in Italy, there is one but.
What?
We have the scholarship to write in the first art of Costitution, which is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country.
Because it has this in the first articulum of the Constitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
So, we change things.
The 7 million work positions are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article of Costitution, and we believe, because things like BEFA are like that.
Thank you.
