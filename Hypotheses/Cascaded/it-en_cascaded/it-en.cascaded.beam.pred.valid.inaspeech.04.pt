In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Cinglearning Forum, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born at the ICIRO.
And the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient: Let's imagine that this is...
A big university class.
So when I go into class, I usually go into class.
The first 10 minutes, when the students arrive and are seven.
Then, I went with Egor my computer to analyze and play a classic music.
And I think this is the first step to create data environments, fewer disabled forms, and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a methodology that uses end of quantity.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on everyone's shoes, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942.
The Unite painting.
Black Park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a young, thirty years old.
Alan Turing.
They have 15 schools in Cambridge.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator was outdated, but it's old to be stuck on a paper.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures to "black".
with his team.
And I built them a machine.
the one you can see.
Dietro: How can we decipher?
This test is written by ATDSC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine?
And we make them form the concept of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about mental magazine.
"Computing machine learning."
Does anyone proposes the test to you?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
Are we familiar with one more person?
that would tell her a computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a M machine.
It's a "o" operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the Mapa's machine exceeds that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question, who comes from person?
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they get there.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
We've heard about Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is an active argument.
Both premises.
Feritire.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detutive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
It's close to building deductive arts.
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people?
Initiality.
Then you must act.
It must be adapted to this.
You have to set goals, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote can a machine to think.
Let's say, can we make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
Through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological construction.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's close to building entities.
Artificialities are supported by man.
It's a cycle.
[Yes!]
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I'd like to share with you some examples: optimal agents are those who work better than all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that resolve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, think that a few years ago a child has been rising.
From the start of the Rubik cube, it was resolved in 4.73 seconds.
None months ago they created an agent, a robot that could fit in 0.63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
that act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the camp is...
The face of scacks, shakes, landscapes, beaten by artificial people.
We have human rights agents.
Those who act almost like all people, for example in the Pker Texano game.
I'll ask questions about the kicking.
We looked at the "minds."
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
We are talking about the fridge.
What's it?
Mela.
What are we talking about?
From the bus of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world, in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
In America it was introduced to a concept of technological singolarity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest.
Arts of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate?
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with a exponential call.
This is a sad moment.
The abandonment ...
I'm preparing in the wallâ€™s law, for which ...
Computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, twelve years and in quadruplicate every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we could already be able to operate in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the test and turning.
And then?
In 2045 and theindic is the moment when technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against the same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
An student at the University of Varese, I followed a course of epitimology, deontology and ethics of computer science, taken by the Gaithan professor at Lanzerone Lanzerone.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the things we had to do was to propose an obectation.
According to Turing's test, against artificial intelligence, I was the only one who proposed a formulated decision with mathematical communication.
The toney is stupidity.
I want to describe it in simple ends, let's suppose that we can take the intelligence of all people, to put it together.
The symbol of the summit has the lead to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we keep going.
An equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
Let's start with the first question.
I can use machines to think.
Now I'll encourage you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
But how many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely by hand, and I've got to everybody, I call the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his own phone, which doesn't do absolutely for me a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here to discuss.
We can consider mobile photographs a new linguistic way of influencing the aspect of view than the forms of complication: technological consciousness that exists.
In the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer, it still makes the difference compared to the simple gesture of premishing a smartphone.
And how does photography cells change the forms and structures of professional photography to find answers to these questions I tried to face a confront?
With photographer, accurators, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflexes.
I took the photos of professionals who, for the first, already ten years, opened the challenge of this new middle, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the experts, of their share experiences through the cellulare.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
at the DESC of the New York Times Magazing photo shooting.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big community places of contemporary.
selfie, for example.
The selfie is to simply get involved in a world's narcissistic delirium, or it can't be seen as some sociologists have sustained with the disturb of body dismorphism and it can even be re-related, as some psychologists have sustained, with the body dismorphism, with global dismorphism, and to get involved in a session.
Like a "identified state," as a subsidiary of his image, which is Joyamente reinforced by the visibility of female artists like "Kateard Ben."
To look at Scholager.
It's the financial term which has embedded and still secrets our vision of the mobile.
This is my channel, almost victim, designed by my photographic experiments, it's simply the result of a world's epidemic to be happy.
Or, as sociologist Bornata has sustained in New Yorkenson, it can't be let to the police of more complex fators, of social, storic nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
It's called "I Revolution," applied to a story of mobile photographs, because in front of the power of images we were wired to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
Let's forget because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still worthy of the process of those gangs.
In certainties, as brilliant as the philosopher Zygmunt Pound.
It's as a typical of modernity, architecture, work, family, coppy, are increasingly increasingly increasing, and here the drawings are unstabilized in a universe in movement, spontaneous from the average of the messages that harvest them daily.
The phenomenon of the mobile photographs seems the most natural expression way.
A liquid vision that is composed, makes you compose.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event, with their cell phone.
What is the only professional photographer left?
And what difference happens between Western photos and conscious photos?
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
taking part in the process of democratization of photography.
I started with the Kodak industry and it arrived until IFO.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's orchestra, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
Following for being.
A powerful tool to guide public opinion is to capture a source of devices and information hardly controlled by the regions: this is a picture of Cairo-Pensiti, a show that the Folfang museum has dedicated the rule of the mobile photographs in the Arab Spring.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he's liberated from the need to adopt a political agenda, a law and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalism priority, he's liberated from the impossibility of limited resources.
And he allows them to put themselves directly into the news department, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
We offered Time magazine in 2012, with Instagram coverage and directly posted in real time through T-cobering its own images, delivering a new model of Newsmking and aiming to journalism, reality in journalism.
This is the scale model that had been originated after this experiment, and if it's true that in the radiation, "Psat," we photograph the compulsively, a quantity of pictures of hell ultra better than the one that we are able to remember, and, truthfully, even in this same time, new paths of preservation of the world's memory, in which we read against the evolution of photography and society in the 90s.
Or you are born men.
We traveled by corporational section, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by those professional and non-normal photographs, and there is a job of scalping in the accent of large artistic and narrative photos around a topic.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Vengami Lowi.
Hr. VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic measures that, starting with a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Bay Strek platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and made a huge traffic of intimate and minimal narration of the majority of basic lines.
Richarch Corte Ernandt, who tasted discourse and acknowledgement in the street, creating a personal beauty.
I'll admit that he did a tennis court, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempt and partial Community that returns to his work.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
The Peter of Campo, who, through the Everest Everi Count, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African African African, along with media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame, has also proved to put in question the stereotypes of photovoltaicism.
As if Luis did, who claimed the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, telling in the IV series, one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history, with the most new vision method.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who has shown his successive manifesters in the sink, who is, during the protests of Mai Tan, with an old puzzled bronic, and contemporary has registered his cellulate the moment in which the actress of the Bronics hits and is born the traditional image, long afterwards and contemporary stream.
Well, what do these photos know how to do, that we don't know how to do everything?
To keep going to the outskirts of the action, or looking for the vision of many personal vision of the evolution, avoiding more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creativity the code of storytelling, designing in a big and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world's perspective.
And the quality of deep learning.
Because anybody is the pregnant recovery tool.
However, if the photographic impairment is smiled by a single, articulated in a coherent manner.
You can distinguish yourself.
Right away from the background that is me.
That's all I believe.
Another difference between a photography which is: the real life color, its reproducing bubble, its self-referent and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
You feel this.
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
Half thirds have come into the mind.
In our quickly lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
An email.
It doesn't exist.
And so, in this room, those actors.
These are the fights?
And to give you a frequency of 50 ARS, so you imagine, you shoot home after a job magazine really stressing.
You tag with your partner, with your partner, and then you will get to bed in your bedroom and think you're on your own.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
We have a positive side.
Or better, I start before the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
Great.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/30, isn't more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
They enjoyed when I was a child.
Well ...
I know it, you may think that this is the classic 'backyard' history, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness.
During those days, in the burden, in that house, I started to play music with everything around you, so ...
Each boundary of roots was no longer.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But let me become my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
I say, at some point,
But it will become a normal person, I mean.
So I started studying yesterday.
It's the pianoforte.
I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to stop the clearing, the problem was that I liked the arbore very much, that there was a strictly ambiguous song, bringing it to the first years of studio in genius.
I also dropped the blow.
But it's good then, to dare ...
My classmates are easy to illustrate.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to sponsor it.
to the problems of life.
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the rumor made us grow much more.
And of a smile.
So here is my mission.
Even when there are children it's like transforming a failure, a sound.
In music.
And to harmonize what it is.
It's around me.
It was a great turn of dollar, Gino Paoli.
And all this would be conclusions, but no, my life was complicated in this way.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
What is the study?
Well, this is one of the hardest ways to understand, but also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion.
Our inner ears, the colony of the systems, our team, reaches the massive functional around the fifth week of gestation.
Thirty weeks of gestation: this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching.
And this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
To what spetheral in life, once born, it must be ready to the sound texture.
You shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So no, in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child is once born.
- Yes.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else, OK?
(Applause) What is it, but what is sound?
The sound is this ...
It's all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely abstract in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
Boys the son's column every day, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who scavenged us, because mom scavenged us, and not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
In a small town, what?
Picola for the men of Mility.
in a small town in San Pietro.
Hello in your house, maybe?
It captures the same as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me.
I imagined higher, well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So?
starting from this budget.
The visibility?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try!
Imagine our life, I would like to assume your ability to observe, then we are in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we start to...
Let's take pictures of the feet, the wisdom, then letton, and then another perspective, then it's photo from below, they don't do it, but we also do those, and then there's a hearing force, so we call a drone to make a lot of photos: "Well, a food blog isn't true," but it's true.
"Food, well!"
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among the other, two!
Listen.
Fermarvi?
What about listening?
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, hooing it.
your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born.
What about harassment?
It's from me.
It was 2013, I wanted to flee far from school, a series of failures, problems, and other things.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I wrote the plant: yes, it's true.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artistically, it's really far from me.
Shanghai, I decided to take part in a competition, an artistic residence and the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to me.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of the whole world, of all cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the city's sidewalks, the cities are a great musical tool, in order to welcome this musical instrument, you can enter the heart of the city.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a Sonora column.
So, at this moment?
I want to swallow you.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography differently, and you've become more than once, but that smoke, that comes from tombs, that's coming.
But Brooklyn bridge can resonate.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
Everything is completely in the leg.
and the desire to resonate with others.
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was another part.
It's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you ...
You know a bunch of posts.
In this photo ...
The drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
(Applause) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds gave me data of these children that in this tube.
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Then, and now that is elaborated.
And this is not.
Salt, to the span of...
(Bianche) Great.
And I like you a little, it seems like...
It's so normal that I've never been, I've been attacked in this very beautiful situation, and it has remained a very low frequency, which has become a syntetizer.
It's a big deal.
It's in the lab.
OK, Genova is "Mr. Zandis" (Laughter) It wasn't a fight, that's one thing would be.
Everyone.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Junt of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical instrument, and it helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
The cheap of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I cry.
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particularly frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has transformed into what it is.
The door voice of the column are no.
This is the rock sound.
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova Mall.
It took me to this point.
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
I'm sitting on our passions, in my and in your lives, and in the way people will tell you they're rumorous, stupid.
For a long time, she really wants to hear her, and I thank you for listening, thank you.
As Guy Beck in Italian said in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea, in such as the idea of the Ristitution linked to monetary Ristitution, to the benefit, very often, instead, the restitution is linked to restitution what you did, what you learned.
And to pass from the part of those who say: it doesn't work.
Afterwards in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approve, so the post of a 18 minutes shared some story with this story, starting from the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's story.
It was around Segrate, in the same year, my friend Monico, organized the money recipe to pay the school.
From the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some people said, "No, because we need to help, we must think about the common state.
Most of them faced these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
But it has taken a billion 200,000 to read, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro, then, and it was an extra effort of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similarly, the same school at the next school is active, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
There's the concept of gameback, of reproduction.
It's extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole of society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Both.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've been lucky, I'm regained, I help the school.
I used the university, along the museum, along the theaters, there are all the communities that can sustain voluntarily live with restitution of volunteers, not that for me it's not been informed, because there it's a phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are also the mechanisms, it's the physical experience, there are the processes, it works, it's not based on this.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker.
It says, "Desiste Miss Dwn" is the moment.
We are already expecting a lot.
Initially, you ask, "You're missing a moment."
Obama has a famous bananasier and has been an incredible technological debt.
technological boats, there are often 100 million dollarians, so not worried about these things, they don't only happen in Italy: they build a seat that doesn't work.
A lot of millions of content, and this is the standard response they receive.
(Laughter) Anyway, I think not to finish for some day, but then someone has stopped criticating, and it's enough to get rid of criticism that is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is extraordinary.
It's not common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Let's raise awareness of the technologies that were sent by Google, other companies, got fired, and agreed with the white house, not riachitty, laughing that you put in, functions on the site, stay in a few weeks, in a decim of the costs.
Many would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
"Yeah!"
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting time, and that's what ...
I'd like to explain to you about what it was like, the spirit of people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible.
And make them again reproduce and scarce.
It's to create a replicable system that is the MIUS of Torris, from this effort that has been born.
A replicable system, what we expect to do as well.
[A.DE.]
I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, which have been the ows of our lives that have inspired us and have taught us.
Well, those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
But, of course, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
I wanted to do it.
From Worldview, there's no way.
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Twenty years later, we're five to the meeting of San Francisco, and he came to my visa, to Silicon Valley, high levels of sensitive need for transformation in general.
Anything has led us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes, for the digital transformation of the recording public, asked me, why don't you help space for a couple of years?
I think, I reflected, the payment with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my gerpeso gurus, to soon make it brief, I decided to apply a methodology to choose, in detail that I didn't react to it, and I couldn't, or I also try to notviocine.
The choice has been made and so it has been done by Rome for two years.
The welcome of...
Ah, my zen!
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
(Laughter) I would mentally like oscetticism and bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But did you wish this disguise, and I didn't expect it, obviously?"
Butoscienticism should often have cinism, that throw you a certain mentality.
You never see her, obviously, you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind.
This country, in truth, lack a lot of sense of common good.
And it's doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interest.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner.
For the older people, you recognize it, as it's a high-grade commission, I say this because it's the huge title, my children gave me an action, and, initially, of extraordinary commissions, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume people on the leaves of the public record.
The only thing I asked you here is: since the systems from the inside don't turn into each other, we want to try to transform them with people outside, where the fact that we don't know public administration is a sign, not a reliable, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so we can sustain it, we created it.
Not big, but neither too small: technological expectations, around 80 times, 20% hopeless to make giants, legal ones.
Doctors of communication.
Here you see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, "Why don't we write?"
What I think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
It's also temporary.
To a compent, probably, is much better than what you see, how you're convinced.
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other reason, maybe some of you recognize it, that closed photography of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone's children, all the United States, in this massive sport, in terms of investments and infrastructure?
We created the vision.
The country operational system, a series of fundamental components, can be built more simple, efficient for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
The vision of beauty, the introduction, is decrime and blood.
I've continued in my place, a field of business in salt, but that American future, if I don't agree.
And I continued, we will also find many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of us will say, don't know how public record works.
We've already tried many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
And I continue.
Let's take a lot of criticisms: some comments will be sincerely useful, others will be productive and prejudice.
Well, the criteria of the first type will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and we have many treatments.
But the second guy, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the animal being a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the Times magazine cover.
Here's it.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible for us to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of course, at least one cent of them decisively qualified, we used digital media channels for the channels, a application called Jazz, we put it in Beth in the Govern Sea, I did a math test and a terdicoli for the technological part, the team gathered the clinical mass, now we are a few teeth, and he was successful for flags, what did we do?
In fact, we are dealing with idraulics.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect because the big problem.
And what?
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected is silos and not to connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their fears, their own applications, so it's about introducing this, writing it, explaining it.
In years, implementing this, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
Then there are software, of course, and doing so many activities in management project.
So there are so many identical activities.
But we can't even smaller.
To make the tasks of the sink, in time, you have to make them better, to interface the tents, selling more simple things.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your friends you can't do your GDP.
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we said, "The piano tends to publishing the record, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation of pumping?
Due.
It has written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
The first time it was...
It has been assessed and sponsorized by the government, the formal piano requires a team game to simplify the public administration public, the city's lives, particularly the piano.
It has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, and especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
What is this, the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
According to the recovery of the technological rules and the rules may probably pick up three warning wages and connections to other norms in other regulations, and at some point there are the technological rules that are quite shocking in compressible: unfortunately we can't abuse these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: the trendial piano has put its hands to the technicals of you understand it, has put in the way we can talk to the administrators, to give us feedback, re-dox documentary, so that the administrators themselves, the public and software can be either.
Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano.
In the militant platforms, these are the competitive platforms, they are the digital payments, they are the things that abilitate in general all the public administration public activities, and even more they will be.
Digital payment is one: digital payment, electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
Let's do that.
While developing technologically, all the data of your citizens, that at this time are about 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in a huge database.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk about the rest of the administration applications: when I come across a community to the other side.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago and a week ago we made an Akaton.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability, they have got 96 interventions.
Bag-fixing, so, putting up problems of software in a world.
A improvement of documentation and even new projects: all this conflict we're talking about sustainability and replicability of the void for various spons of space, just like you, where you are wired, all documentary, all of the code, but always more, of applications, in San Francisco, although it's not Italian, there are many Italians that are helping us from the technological point of view.
In the Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even of me.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that officially...
They're not limited to do an iraulic, I enter into the ball as well as the child.
But it's good for kids to be composed, to disappoint me, this might be, for example, and it's one of those things which is shortly broken.
When we'll launch Alsa version, Alfa, it's called digital citizenship.
Do you have a phone?
Smartphone has the digital identity, data has the card of electronic identity, Nepsi.
It's already functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction between citizens and public administration.
With the simple requirement.
We are dreaming a little, because work will really do so much, but it has different vision of this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it.
We design a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rules and not the institution.
A country in which they read and recognize and promote the right to innovate, to prevent building it.
A country with high technological competitions is also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public administration is an wealth: where the best humans do better to work in public research centers, that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation.
They lead development to the country.
That's how I have a dream.
And what the components to do all this process policies?
Technical data are really many and maybe many.
But if I don't have a dream about how to punish hardly, they can help me do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
(Laughter)
[A.DE.]
And here it's been taken somewhere in this theater among others, to this point, but it's easier, and in a site I managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Digital Treeumation, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our dream is our social, thanks.
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
What would you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know it's, then raise your hand those who will change some of your body, maybe lose some thread, or maybe win them in muscles.
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom, raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want, or maybe you're one of those who will change partner.
(Audience): Yes.
But more times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't understand if I took part, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have a more united family, but my parents were separated.
(Applause)
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
On the twice, I felt the most complex professors, they seemed to me all eyees and they reflected me in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Besides, the university would have wanted to work, but I found out the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I started fighting and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't affect me from what others thought of me on the biggest economical feasts, of the interpersonal relationships with characteristics that I acquired from birth.
Then I became a psychologist.
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but since most of the cases were the only three posters to play in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a good thing, but they ended up living their problem.
(Applause)
Nowadays, the strategy is more broadcast.
It's lamenting, we're sorry about everything, we're lamenting a bit about it, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, frozen, that I'd have done differently, we'd sorry because there's no injustice, and this paralyzes you, hypnotize and fits to the homeland.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who wasn't doing anything but to get bothered, from when I started to talk, then the girls with whom he translated her, so the fact that she didn't have a job, the ultimate ship of the government that didn't help her, felt a valuable, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized her daily life.
Because getting worried, for all of us, is a little like this.
Because with a small effort.
Then we obtained a big result.
To review the victim's role, which is listened, comforted, helped.
(Laughter) Anyway.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
From alone or with friends, to high voice or your mind?
And you can remember one thing already happened, or one thing that maybe one day could happen.
And you can lie to your tea, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you are forced to memorize hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what is harming you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, is that of lamenting, assuming that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Let's go.
(Laughter) Another complicated strategy, when things are stretching, is that of imporciation, it requires our necessity.
But at the base of this mentality there is an increasing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being what surrounds us.
Doesn't you like ice cream?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
(Laughter) You felt a bit dirty, but why could you never be suffering?
I took two pillars and solved it easy.
The wife breaks you, divorces you.
In the fresh lights we can all know how much rising it is.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
It's too big that we can't reach it, send it to the psychologist: we're here, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, so that the world around you can encourage the perfection with your own needs.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I wasn't doing anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to ease the waves of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
Well, it's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in a grade.
It's a classicon, but it doesn't.
"You've never asked me if not for that."
And he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do another way to get me uncontrol, and that's how, in the end, a strong iron-looring arm that always starts with the same stream word.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old.
Instead of removing the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy they privilege.
When things are not going like wearing, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result, think about a couple of times, because you will have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's...
Fair enough that there are no, like a tool, take the forehead, put it under the ground.
But at the base of this dynamic, there is often the pleasure of facing the conflict emerging, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the deserve of necessary needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that the time was openly driven in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned some important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no.
Things that didn't follow them, I didn't learn to say no to the relationships that were looking for it, there was any social condition, and it was one of the things that would always be measured, but in this way where they were going to finish their needs, their desires, and their ambitions were always under the fear of facing conflict and the need to count how many of them were.
It's the strategy that privileges when things don't go as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, you'll finish to disrupt it.
(Laughter) Sading, involving your needs or suffering them, there are three limiting strategies, and I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself, in my life, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the spedal for which I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuccelli, here for her, there's no more space, it's pleased to keep the collapse with us, to accept a disturb.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most, or if everything had to go there to do a job that neither had to do with all that I had studied until then.
I've heard about dying, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing yourself.
If it had changed me?
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
And if it was a psychologist that was really brilliant, competent, complete, united, the primary school wouldn't have sent me via.
If I had done that, the thing wouldn't harm me more than that, but, perhaps, I would have traveled myself before even imitating it.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
But why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do?
He goes to the agreement of choosing us.
And choose you.
What's the cause of things?
That they don't leave as a winner.
Keep in yourself as a cause of things that don't go as far as you are.
This is our bifth.
If you haven't ever had a job at the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll be alone and willing to confront something much bigger, if you read books, go to courses to acquire new skills or consolidate those you've already had, you can work on yourself to become a journalist.
But because life is from those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
And if inside the tank, things don't go well, you think that it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It is showing them a message of inadequity and it's spreading it, if you've been part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
Then, what can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
Then things change.
But they don't change the case, but they change because you know you've changed, I used to go to the research of your needs.
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate.
to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war.
(Audience) Yes.
I know one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, national prostitute, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
And if you go to yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a standard of the contact.
It's starting to work on me, considering the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to warn to be a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes pressure, to bring great value to their lives.
But, my friends, I met a couple of ...
What about the problem?
Stereots, prejudices, obsession is the doctor of the mates, homicile is the doctor of the debts, but had to talk to a friend, but went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
I would have had to get lamented or not to explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
No, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of having mine.
And the turn of ...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube.
Well, in which I talked about psychology, here for the crack, I'm about to charge for anansy, because maybe you think...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm from 79: publishing psychology in Italy, my magazine, and what left me more than anything was recognition that the schoolbands at the beginning came back.
I want to leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbium they've been read to the vice presidential and the power.
I had dreams.
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The story you have to have is that which you can hold and carry on, those who don't know how to build and you need to discuss, because the topic should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
What if there's something I learned from all this journey that helps me?
(Audience) Yes!
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For many reasons, I've been asking you a question.
If I have the chance to express a desire, only one thing to change a aspect of your life that doesn't come up.
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, the less proved, it's a small question that I personally was very useful and based on the logic that, in order to produce great changes, it's about concentrating in so many actions.
What's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put ...
Your life in the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You may think: Which is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do?
to put your life into the direction.
your ambitious life.
Fedetto.
"Oh, are you joking about the rubbish, what do I send?"
Or feels right now, I went with the pullman, right?
And hide my hand where do I put the packs?
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I made my hand, I knocked my pelle.
Secondly, it's now to change.
When I arrived to my mother.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
So, of diverse and diverse abilities.
percussions are so fast.
So immediately, they take off the distances and join the battles.
We are partners.
We are part of the sets.
Seven kids, I see, I see, Laura, Paola.
It's Daniel.
I saw him growing.
And our provides were marketing.
The Friday was the day of protest, where it was entered.
Studying at the Andreoli music school.
The first bidons were peeled, and he was together.
The first one deserves together.
Then we decided to become part of the band.
CR: From there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw: the first transcend, the first markets in the sinkets, the first satisfaction, the first meetings.
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Soundly?
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we stayed.
The earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
(Audience): Yes.
As I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
On the other hand, it was completely district.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
You can see it in doppoli.
And the erlotte?
We've done it.
Luckily, we all found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manitis, of military purposes.
Well, inside that tunnel ...
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth shaking?
To search...
A smile?
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
I said sci-fi slips.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubophons that have become?
The tools built and combined with ping pong roots, to take off with big ones and if you cross.
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already there is born our first spettacol.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we stayed, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men, and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards.
We did.
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also display a moment from our land.
to breathe for a moment.
After the year, we cracked, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender.
And no one of us would have ever thought it's a stone?
It could change our lives.
But...
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
Mults are ending.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first master?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
What about the maternal backyard?
We haven't really done so many.
And also for me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly me.
It's the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also.
This is freshness.
The problem is there are so many possibilities and future.
That's it.
What happens when a dream?
And it becomes reality.
Now I have to go back to the sports mirrors.
They'll wait.
What is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until I've been asked what has happened in the last 250 years.
250 years that have changed our history radically, and that we live nowadays, we are talking about social innovation.
And my question is, what is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
This is the digital photo: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, I believe so everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution. However, these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, somehow, strictly battled arbitrary, in the 2000s, that we are currently living.
And we try to understand, then, what has happened in these 250 years, which ones flood?
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the broadcast on the Internet, we considered it an iron.
What was my studies?
The school book, in fact, was not only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we are huge debates, usually debates, for example, because we need the glass motorcycle.
And the winning motor is not only a vapore mask, but for example the tool that has favored, and it resembles much faster, the estation of carbon, and the risks possible to a significantly lower cost, and the risks possible to a significantly lower cost.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
We also need to wear glass motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanan invitation, it's an Italian invention, the scoppy motorcycle.
We need, for example, the automobility industry.
In reality, first, it was used in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motor that couldn't go from far away, when I was able to understand how to take off that belt and turn it into the verb and then on to that sculpture that developed the automobilical industry, which is all that was produced.
But they are not.
And for the Industrial Revolution, we still have discussions, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, from one part to another of the world, ever smaller than we knew.
But is it also what has allowed us?
And it has taught us to deposit the digs.
Stop.
And yes, since you saw the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
Let's interrupt everything.
No, if I had some caves under the sea, the first cave to give a storic dimension was removed from space between mothers and articulates, not only two people who witness, but the first cavity went there.
And we are around 1858.
Behind, there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another invention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
In Europe it was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
Today, there's the last stage: a time in 1873 is replaced by the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
It's a part of our history, it's a great swimmer.
But let's move forward, we tried to get a bit longer rooms, and we arrived in 1950 the adventure was already grown and getting to know a certain agency, and something was a seventh.
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important events and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never happened before in the past history: the computer, the sidewalks.
Three artists who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stance like this, and had functions of marriage, simply landed more quickly.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, it was decided to open these landmares' releases, but it didn't land because they were under the ground, but landing because they hadn't known, but in those 50 years of the Internet revolution had happened something else.
These rots called arpa, the Internet.
They became and began to be the World Web that we know.
A system diffused, orchontal, non-archical, extremely captured, is able to bring information, to collect information, in 1981 only 300 computers connected to the Internet.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
But when the functional strength, as I said, was replaced by the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
And the Internet had theoca that, if little by little, we started to live theoca that we've lived now, that we're living now, that which is called "Instraction of creative education."
Because of course, it's an industrial process that tells us that what's new gradually distruits what's old, because it needs to make space, and we'll see better then.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions, but there is a story that is a little more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which we start to reflect, to accompany you.
It was 1863 when, from the scale, it wasn't the Italian yet.
Minister Minghetti, put an investment financial policy, establishes that 27th century of the judge is correct, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing ministers, I'm introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their surroundings.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most importantly.
It has transformed the economic power of power of production.
of goods and services, in the power of producing one.
Well, the report.
But there is a second aspect, which is the frigerator, for us women, of course, it was a revolution that has been quite relevant to us, but what was really the frigerator.
It's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but it's also the industrial system that allows us to keep, in a massive way, a structured way, in the soil quantity of food.
So, there's another chance, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of the daily life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
And in the breath, what did we say?
The computer didn't arrive and the internet came, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, the speed, the speed of the rings, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and we move fast, it's the speed, we now do things fast, and we move fast, like the qualificator of these years, but we're very fast.
But until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2001, when we can say that the 20th century was finished, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that significantly indicate the passing of one horizon of another, 2001 and 2008.
The American economy started to slow down, and there were Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
However, there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was no longer the warning of failure, they don't talk about it, but still there.
And I changed something.
But what has changed has changed the economical paradigm, we couldn't.
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis, which was effectively verified in 2008; it was crazy, we didn't think, but how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would be left: we were certain, and we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
And this print?
Well, there are potential multinationals in most of them, but above all, all the companies that are given after 2011.
And what did those companies do, aren't they innovated?
They were inventing something, they had never been able to build something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done, buy and sell, travel, learn.
Learn.
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
And the adventure, the idea so often denied, we try to look at the health of digital tales, according to five factors: connectivity, we are ten percentage below the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection between 50 feet and so little.
Anything already, according to human abilities, human resources, community resources, challenging abilities, which are disconnected between empty competences, abilities based on what allow us to flow the formatical systems, the digital systems, those that allow us to develop.
And a third future that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
It's a third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
This is the public recording system: we immediately go back to the field of some ambiguity, and we keep both important and most importantly a good news for everyone: everyone, every and every five element is growing.
There are all five elements that are growing up, at a speed of growth completely up until two years ago, so we've been attending European countries, and this doesn't mean anything about the new operators, the new competitions, are building a very important and competitive level.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to watch with much attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the abilities and the inclusion of digital in brutal factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first motorbike?
It's what's done greatly in the '50s and the pictures of the walls.
And glasses from being, the small printed media.
Something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't require the biggest multinationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
And you know how to do something extraordinary: "Made in Italy" has a quality, an eccellence in the production of services in the production of product.
It's quite united in their position, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire insistently competences inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can be used.
It's an interaction of the market in an extraordinary way, creating ricks for all the people around us: a nature, nature, nature, and its cultural artistic heritage, and this is the first asset that we have, the first great motorbike that in the hospital, and its anonological heritage, we can't digitalize the croceo.
But can tourists only visit three cities?
Venezia, USA, and then they repeat.
But the ricks of these three cities don't make the richness of our country, and we're learning, maybe we've took the time to start, but we're speed to recover, to include this heritage within a knowledge system that allows us to make it note, and to bring the tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our countries.
The reason I'm going to talk about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word.
What to unify?
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, I'd like to start in a new way.
(Laughter) With a question.
But if someone asked you?
Hello.
According to you, in the last 15, 20 years, we will say, in the 21st century.
In the world, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens are increased or are diminished.
But I believe most of you would answer.
They're increased, if they're period of journalists, maybe they'll add the precious aggressive to increase exponentially.
And this is me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be, too.
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the results of video.
I was prepared with my colleagues for a rapportopment.
We know about inequality, from when they are data, that is, officially, from 1960 to the highest in the world's countries.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
By the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated now we're at the storic mining.
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality in the growth.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible letture is to say: we've put a complete alcohol in order to keep talking about years of increase in inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are myself?
Do we do it?
And ... the feeling wasn't wrong, but maybe the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Wow!
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality, what we try to say about inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality requires some rhythm.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And also somewhere, we moved to Cambrici in 1928, a year before the big crisis of 29: Lickens.
That Cambridge added a speech in front of me.
To a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, in that occasion, Keynes forms two profits: the first says.
It was a seventh, the product.
But for a while I'll be working ...
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this profile, indeed, is realized, because if you're about to engage.
The richest agricultural reforms of the economy.
Effectively, in most companies, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years than DD.
Of course, twelve times, in some 15 occasions, so this profile was realised, but from this Keynes Profession also found a consequence, an idea, that is, that humanity of a little by little, that is where it is lost, little by 100 years, it would be going to...
Lavoring less?
He also spoke, he also wanted to work with everyone, and he saw him a problem for that, because the question that Keynesse was asking, but with all this time he was free, he wanted a week of 15 hours of work, or a three-hour worker every day.
Very well.
Apparently, your second feature didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
I want to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says that we will all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We will remember much less, we will work three hours a day: we are sure that it's not made anywhere, we can see those suits in Italy.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
And what's interesting is that these 16 seconds, if we keep this trajectory, that is actually realised, because we reached the beginning of 1990% of the time of our lives to work, their lives naturally working, that is, during 15 years, when we are able to compare a job.
Let's do it?
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Naturally, if that happened, there are reasons too.
Have you and if you want a banal, for example, the anguish is enormously aligned.
Because we die a lot after life expectancy, and those who grew up from something like 27 years have also been studied up until 25 and 30 years old, so young people are launched, but there is a much more important reason why, from the start to September, from 19900.
Our quote of time?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion.
It's this dramatic, dramatic series, because you can see it...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
Today, we are very low, we are around 50 scarc shoes, but from 1968 and 18 a year, the rate of occupation has always been lower than 50%.
But a rate of occupation goes down to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income, are more than workers.
In front of this?
Facious behavior: can we also have a relationship?
It's enthusiastic and saying: but this is the progress of beauty, it's modernity.
Things are gone like this because we can allow it, but then we can see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things are gone in the same way, because if this interpretation is true, it should also have happened in the United States, that then we see confrontation.
Thank you.
In Italy.
Testing units.
This is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to the work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument, while we don't believe it, but it's even more impressive and the storage number of the management rate, because here we see.
Which has an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency to the payment rate in the United States to the USA, in our case, we have a situation.
Riduation.
at the occupation rate.
But then that?
Education is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most people live in a condition that I defined -
Happiness parassity, dependence, because, as a result, depending on the subject to yours.
This can also be a family member or the state, but it would help me to use the available distribution without working.
A friend of mine who did the theater, when I found these results, we went to the scene and I asked them.
And you, as you showed this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence, and you know what answered me?
With Epopopotam, it's the moon that lives on the backs of the hypothama, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, here, here.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
But the buffag, or the buffag on the hypothama, or on the other great mammals, these murderers also live on the rhythm, on the buffs, we have this film that will interest some of them in which you can see.
These are the ones.
The animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
By paying attention to the resources that the buffler supplies, which are larvae, ze that everything that host on the golden dips, is not clearly that it's playing or infrassed by the hell.
Anyway, this is sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
How can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers and minority of producers?
There's this kind of improductive consumption, the first one there told me, "But this is the sign language society?"
And society, signals, like feudal society in which there is a blind ceiling, that has put in the conditions of living without work.
(Laughter) But naturally, it's not enough: we have to add a qualification.
What can be defined?
In a signorious society, but a society that's useless.
"Yes."
Because consumers are more than producers.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission: in the massive society things are a little more complicated, the signs have become so many and...
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the idea would define a damaging relationship, let's see why.
The relationship?
The buffaco with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food located in the trees of Ecuport.
Because we can't, we can't epower, we can't nourish the animals living in the buffer, but it's in some way a reminder of obligation, as we are, in the colored shapes that we keep, the situation is very complex, and this is a house of legate tone, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
That's it?
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
The question I had done by Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very asmetrical in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools of the protection of inequality, in other words, to calculate a coherent coherent concentration of neighbors that the tool with which inequality is measured, we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have a job that has both workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the position of the year is to be lost in the graduation.
This is Turchia.
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this grader, the best situation, that of the Union beach, with the USA in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
As we arrived at this: this is the history of inequality in access to work in Italy, always measured to the efficient decent, and you can see something fascinating, that inequality is the minimum during the working positions in more, our families.
(Laughter) But here I concluded that it would be 1,000 or a month, and in addition, we'd have 12,000 euro income approximately approximately for more than a year, and our goal would be 15 billion euros to spend, as much as health and school cost together, more or less in Italy, there is one but.
What?
We have the scholarship to write in the first art of Costitution, which is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country.
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
So, we change things.
And we create the seven million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to spot the article in one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a BEFA.
Thank you.
