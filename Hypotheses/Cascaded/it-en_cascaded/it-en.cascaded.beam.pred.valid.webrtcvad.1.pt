(Laughter) In 2016, I was given a reward, from the out of a carning force, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, by the name a little particularly, let's be alert at the turn.
The motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
But when I go into the classroom?
The first ten minutes, when the students come and are seven?
The companion of my computer to analyze and use classical music: I think this is the first step to create environments of fewer acalling data and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a methodology that uses end of quantity.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative.
To transmit the knowledge to the students and precisely with this method that I want to start my lesson, explaining a topic on everyone's shops, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942, the UK.
Blockchain park.
A residence northern Londra.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
It's stigma.
It was commonly a machine to write.
Theedes used thischanism to communicate the digital operator of tastes, but, older than stealing on paper, those letters, they are stuck in other letters, according to a method that is implemented mechanically under the machine, those letters of them.
But anyone interacted this paper was in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
(Audience) Yes.
Alan Turing was one of the main figures of Black.
Putting them and constructing them a car.
What can you see?
Dietro: in order to decipher...
This test is written by AIDSC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
(Laughter)
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about Mind's magazine.
"Computing machine learning" in intelligence.
Does anyone proposes the test to you?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be another person?
Ridy and grabbed the computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a "o" operator.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the vehicle is overcome that the Turing test if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
(Laughter)
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
[Yes!]
It's based on human thinking.
[A.DE.]
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
What's the moment they get?
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man?
All men are dead?
Socrates and mortal.
This is an active argument.
From these two premises, one will conclude: from here the detive logic is born, according to the question of the logic of thinking.
It's close to building deductive arts and transferred in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people, an entity.
So you must act.
Do you have to add the answer?
And you have to set goals, and know how to bring them to the end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects.
Riforming Turing's quote can think about a machine.
We can say, is it possible to make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
[A.DE.]
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
They are trying to build intelligent and supported artificial integrity of man.
It's a cycle.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents, according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
Human beings.
Human beings have the optimal actors.
I'd like to share with you some examples: optimal agents are the agents that benefit better from all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that solve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, do you think that a young man has been rising for some years?
From the start of the Rubik cube, it was resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any month ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve in 0.63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, the game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the green aircraft, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who exist almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answer the questions of the Kitch.
We looked at the "hani."
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example, I have the classification of objects in cognitive activities such as crowned words, and there are underground people who addiction to all people, examples are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today aren't able to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge.
How is it?
Mela.
Or are we talking about the Marco of Apple Corporation?
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with a exponential call.
This setting follows the predict in the wall's law, in which computational complessity, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, which is raddoppy years and is quadruplicated every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045 and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change the human intelligence.
(Laughter) In his articulum.
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against the same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
Then, a few years ago?
Another student at the University of Varese, followed a course of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, taken by the Gaithan professor Lanzerone in his ear, against the Twing test, against artificial intelligence, unfortunately, has given us a few years ago.
"What is the stupidity of human?"
Would you like to write in simple terminals, let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
To put the seed, the symbol of sleep on the run of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we obtain an equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story ...
Relaxing ourselves to the first question: Can machines think?
I'd like to share with you.
With an open question.
[A.DE.]
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Honestly (Applause) How many of you today have taken pictures?
OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the future, and welcome everyone, I call the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, is the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, his contact on the market, his project, his environmental and environmental use, but what sense can be, trying to understand the processes through which we communicate.
Technical consciousness that is in the production of a story, part of a photographer and a new language, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the experts of their experiments sharing images through the cellulare.
To find answers around me and I arrived in New York, the Torre's photo album in New York Times McGoods, in Cathy Ryan.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parents, in the sale of Parifoto, one of the most prestigious photography fears in the world, to enter those places where photography is distributed, is sold, is put in account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these inequalities.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to be involved simply in a world's narcissistic delirium, like some sociologists supported with the basis occupational of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as an avocation of section, like an identified stream, as a so-called rhythm of its imagination.
Or Ash Roagger, the financial term which has shaped and still secrets both our mobile vision.
This is my channel, Zazzi, who is the victim of my photographic experiences, is simply the result of a world's epidemic of pleasura contact, or, as the sociologist Born in New Yorkenson, can't be led to the number of more complex factors of social, storical, even economical nature, but photography, is not the land of interpretation in a book.
It's called "I Revolution," applied to a story of mobile photographs, because in front of the power of images we were wired to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And so we are, the history of the mobile photography is short, but in a few years I've traveled millions and millions of people, a new code that goes beyond every linguistic neighborhood, which we use daily to communicate, to testimony ourselves, to feed a broadcastous cost of images that puts individuals into communication from the other side of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective gathering, if you want, that has impressive numbers, every two minutes, today we can take more images of how much human beings have scaven in the interaction of the 14th century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a retirement of professionals, turned into an existing position of our private role in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through images that we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if we take the photos later, it's a new language, then it's the mother language of liquid man, and here the drawings are unstable in an immovement universe, sponsored from front of the media of the messages that refer to them daily, the fluid of photography mobiles, it seems the most natural form of expression, a fluid vision that is composed and decomponed.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing, but in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record any event with their mobile phone, has transformed the photography of mixing professionals in universal language.
Speaking in account of that process of democratization of photography, I started with theera Kodak and arrived at the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs, new possibilities to look at stories, to stories, togets.
Now, on the one hand, opening up to everyone and all of us from a speaker, with a potentially global initiative, has moved the professional photographer of his own scriptive view as a set of pictures, has put in crisis the social foundation, the economical position, the economical position, on the other hand, but.
And he consented them to directly locate ourselves in the district of Newsmade and I visited journalism: this is the machinery of the book that had originated after this experiment, or that in this same time new gravity photographs were born, a political agenda, a photography line, a destination lines, through their messs, for photography, for photography, and photographer, and photography, for the abnormal.
Benjamin Lowi.
Orona Vive, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and describition of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the in-founding.
The solar panic that, through a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers of stance in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographer, an irreperformant look, and made a huge drug deal of intimate and minimal narration on the highest litera of alcohol.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll confess that he did a tennis court, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempted Community to the partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
I was riding a field that, through the Everest African Championship, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal Africa, beyond media stereotypes, of the Western matrix on the crisis and the fame.
They are Stephan of the Luis, who has reinterpreted the God's seed with the cellulare, telling in the IV series, one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history, with the most new vision tool.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who has photographed his successive manifesters in a sink, who is, during the protests of Mai Tan, with an old puzzled bronic, and nowadays has registered and contemporary streams, what do you know how to do these photographs that we don't know how to do?
To dream, walking down the outskirts of the action, or looking for tables of personal vision of many levels of the evolution, avoiding more than recording, designing in a huge media action, thinking and creating the proper contents to be broadcast in diverse platforms and reaching opponents.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To be able to use the authorial exercise for its own perspective on the world and the quality of deep within, because no matter the pregnant recovery tool, only if the photographic interaction is smiled by a single, articulated in a well-known manner.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
All of this I believe still makes the difference between a photography which is: the remote of real life, its reproductive bowl, its self-referential and sharing, and a photograph that, in reality, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silenced, in fact, there are 50 meters of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist.
So in this room, those sectors, these seeds, and add a frequency of 50 ARS, then you imagine not, you shoot home after a job magazine that is really stressing.
But no, there's always the law, this frequency of 50 Hert, that I simply increased the volume: "Man, your partner, with your partner, except, and then you go to the bed on your bedside down your bed and think of being on your own."
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
(Music) Now.
We have a positive side: or better, I leave before the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We are never alone, in other words, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us: beautiful, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/s isn't much more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I was overwhelmed, "But why do you do that, why not make music?"
I am a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, or a little particularly, because my life was complicated, deciding to make music on its own and exclusively through the sound.
My parents divorced when I was little, and I know you to think that this is the classic strappalous story, but no, it was the revelation of my life, so each complement of the dust was no longer, so each complement of the dwelling was no longer.
A classic complements of the fermod, immobile, sound by little, but it becomes my musical instrument, with great joy between the other of my mother, that every eight is not at the end of the clichy, among the other Macciao, you're staying in the streaming, and this is a big relationship.
Of course, I say, at some point...
Anyone is going to become a normal person, trying to say, "Dear because I started studying yesterday."
So strongly, then I liked Woody Allen, so I started smiling Clarinetto, the problem that liked the arenzo-arbore, that there was a normally ambiguous channel.
I also helped Clarinetto.
But that's right, to dare not to make my classmates' illusions.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spontaneous sounds in a way, and I like to disagree with the problems of life.
All of us have attached a rumor, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow much more.
And it's from a smile, so my mission ...
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
It's a gatto.
I cried?
I'd love poetry, right?
I'm going to make a great turn of dollar, kidneys, and it's all going to be conclusive, but no, I've got complicated this way of life.
What's the sound?
But most importantly.
That's the study, it's harmful, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring a closer look: our inner eye, the catalogue of the musicians, our team, reaches the maximum functional around the fifth week of gestation.
This isn't a case, I say about 30 weeks of gestation, that means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching.
Because feet must be ready.
I hope that the speteral of life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture, mustn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, not in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child, once he was born, will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistols. (Applause)
But there is the sound: the sound is everything that we are surrounded by, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
[Yes!]
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see it, you can't touch it, the column goes on every day, the rituals with our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, still.
All of this is the sound column of our journeys, and the visibility is much easier.
We know it.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than how you imagine them.
By the time of the Militarian man, the smallest of San Pietro, the smallest of your house, maybe?
(Laughter)
It captures the same thing, as when a person sees me on video, watches on stage, and then there are hundreds of people, and says, "But you imagined high, well, why is it more low, would it be really impossible?"
Through this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
[Yes!]
Let's dream of imagining our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe, then we're in vaccine.
If it's wrong, not in case, we started a food blog, which then there's opening, so we called a drone to take a picture of the drink, on its own, and then in another perspective, then it's photo from downstairs, it doesn't do it, but we also use those, talk about food to Chile zero, more than 20 to Chileans don't exist, I've lost the tale, but it's multisensorial, but many multimults, much if it's here, and nobody loses the doce.
We photograph it, we keep it.
We make a lot of video, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone, OK?
The best moment, to know the person, is to stay in silence, that silence that between the other doesn't exist, there are two, and...
To listen, to sign up and to listen.
Like in this moment.
[A.DE.]
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, would I like to take you with me?
Returning to the world, hoping your perception of listening and I'd like to start by telling you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life, born from the association of myself.
For the first time, the school of myself: it was 2013, I wanted to go far away from the adventure, a series of failures, problems and others.
So, I decided to choose ... which later turned into harmony.
A city of Atlantis.
I was listening to Atlant, yes, it's true, there was still so much, and I'd like to take you in this moment to Shanghai, where, for 48 hours, I didn't have money, I had so much fear, I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe: the cities are a great musical instrument, you can enter the heart of the city, and we call this project "Sound of City."
And I created a sound column.
So, in this moment ...
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
(Music) (Applause)
(Video) In Ivovatore, Spanish, that ... I'm a single cane, in Ivovatão Caio, in Ivo Manuel Caio.
I'm going to take care of you, I'll take care of you.
(nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (nglese) (Inglese) Bambino 1: I've bought the baby monkey, I've bought the baby monkey, I've bought the baby monkey.
(Music) (Applause) You all went to, you were still focused on visibility, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that is certain, you've been photographed in every way, and you've become more than once, but that smoke that fits tombs that fell, but the bridge of Brooklyn can completely explore in the leg.
and the desire to resonate with the upset.
(Making drum-like sounds) (Sounds) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) I'm going to the counter that I'm really fond of the collapse and an important thing to say.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
In this photo ...
The helpless drop is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are capabilities many times, there are volutly captained many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite city, now, kick the applause, I'll leave you... (Applause) I started to record the first songs.
(Music) (Music) And I like a little - it seems to be a part that I've never been so normal - I've got attached to this lovely little box and it has resulted a very low frequency that has become a synthesisator.
(Making drum-like sounds) It's a means of ventilation.
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a fight, it would be: certain Genova is "Mor Zandis."
Every time.
The writer, which you can see as easily in the Ferrari desk, is not just a writer, for me, is a great musical instrument, and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony, and it does more or less this.
(Music) The last sound, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, it's that of ...
The cheap of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become the voice porting of the sound colony.
(Sigh) That's her aircraft.
(Music)
[A.DE.]
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
(Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) Razzi, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium, calcium.
(Applause) Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
(Applause) Almost with our passions in my and in your lives, and as people will tell you that you're rumorous, you're out of time, you really want to hear them, and I'll give you up for listening, thank you.
(Applause)
As Guy Bakni Italian said, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but it has the idea, in general, the idea of the Ristitution linked to the Monetary Ristitution to Buddifference.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say: nothing works, then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the next 18 minutes shared some of this story.
It was around Segrate, and in the same year, my wife Monico organized the money recipe to pay the school.
The asylum: it's an activity, right?
Very heavy, with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the community State," but most of them were extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community, we picked up a billion 200,000 readings, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro from then, and it was a trick of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we came to the United States, this time is...
Similar, the same school as a school at the right time, and this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
Which means the gameback of restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is mandatory for the whole of society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
I've said so much: this is the purpose of restitution, I've had a fortune, I've got the chance to go to school.
I benefit from the university, museum, theaters, there are all the communities, sustainably they live with voluntary restitution, not that really doesn't exist in a market, there's a huge phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are alsochanisms, there's also physical inequality, there are processes.
The first thing that works is that you don't get into it.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
A supported by the famous Obamaker, who says, "Desistemis Done is from the moment."
Prampi is trying, very actively, because he asks, "Systemy is the one of the moment," Obama Lancia, famous bananasier, and has been an incredible technological debt.
Technological boats have these 100 million dollar gaps, so not worried about these things, they don't only happen in Italy: they build a seat that doesn't work so many millions of stories, and that's the standard response they received.
In a nutshell, the criteria doesn't end for some days, but then somebody has stopped criticating, and it's enough to be done.
It's easy and normal to start by trying to do and help that is extraordinary.
And if we don't have a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Keeping the many technologies that have been sent by Google, the other companies, there are fert, and according to the white house, they have riachitty, charming, put in functions the Site, end up in just a few weeks, at one decimal costs.
Many of us would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
(Laughter)
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting, and that's what...
I want to spare people, and not to explain what it was like.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives, experiences.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
It's possible to make them repetitive and scarce around them, and create a replicable system that is the "Brother Serrice Digital," from this effort has been born.
A replicable system, what we hope to do as well as we do, I want to suffer with the word models, because we also impose the models, which are the odds of our lives that inspired us and that taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, keep on insisting, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
But, of course, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Many years ago, the idea of going back to help was also because they're Italian.
What about it?
I wanted to do it: dumb, dry, right?
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
(Audience): Yes!
Things later, we're five years old to disconnected "materence without Francesco," and we've learned about valuable bicycles, drops to sensitive necessities of transformation in general.
In those things has led us, a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and for the digital transformation of public recording public, asks me because it's not enough to help us during an year year year trip, I think, we reflected, the pavement with my wife, Monica, and talking to my capo, Jerpeso, to make it brief, I decided to apply the debt, and I couldn't, or I pushed myself, or I pushed myself off, or I pushed myself off, or I pushed myself off, or I tried to not even get along.
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years.
A welcome...
(Laughter) "Oh, manzone."
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
(Laughter) I would mentally ask myself about chottingism and bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But do you think this disaster of this disguise, and I did not expect, of course?"
Butoscienticism often has to do with cinism, that throws a certain mentality, you never see it, obviously you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind.
In reality, our country lack a lot of sense of common good.
about doing things because I thought of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, like a menstrual commission, and I say this because it's the brutal title, my children gave me a turn, right from the beginning of an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume some people from the public administration list.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems inside don't turn into each other, we want to try to transform them with people who are out there, where the fact that we don't know the public administration?
It's a sign.
And not aunt Billiti, it's an advantage and not an advantage. So, sustainably, we created a small team, I said 25 people, a number.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations around 80 percent, 20% are expected to make giants, legal, and educational, and communication.
As you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't write what we think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to return to us.
Storally, it has a compassion, probably much better than what you see, as I'm convinced.
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other reason, maybe some of you recognize it, that closed photography of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone's children, all the United States, in this massive sport and I have a vision of investments and infrastructure?
(Audience) Yes!
We've created the vision, the operating system of the country, a series of fundamental components about which building the most simple and efficient solutions for citizens, public management and companies.
But through innovative digital products.
Very well in documentation, it's lacrime and blood.
I've continued in my place, field of warmth in salt, but it's the American future, if I equivocate it.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of us will say, it doesn't understand how public school works at an illustration.
They've already told us many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
And I keep, we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and prejudice.
But the criteria of the first kind will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and there are many treatments.
But the second guy, among those who want to defend the team, is that they always see the animal being a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is our problem: to motivate things that don't work.
(Audience) Yes!
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the carpet of Time magazine.
So here is whereas, although he tried to taste the most possible agent through eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of course, at least one cent of them decisively qualified, we used digital media channels for the channels, an app called Jazz, we put it in Beth in the Govern Sea, he gave me a mathematics test and a terdicoli for the technological part, the team has shown us, now we are a little more glasses, and has initiated to work, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we're talking about hydraulics.
These are the tubes of public recording, some of us can connect because the big problem ...
What is it?
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected is silos and it doesn't connect.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their suffering and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
And we spunched the work of the public administration public, sci-fi scores of software, of course, and we did a lot of good management activities, so so so many legal activities ...
But we can't also have the choice: to make the flames in time, you have to make them improve the interference, make them simpler, all these things are done in parallel, but without your threshold you can't do the test.
(Audience) Yes!
After a few months, at the July of 2017 we said, "The piano tends to public management, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for public transformation in my situation, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the formal piano requires a team game to simplify amministration public, the lives of the citizens, particularly of the piano.
It's been newspaper once in the year, because the kids couldn't have been, and especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to records, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public administration.
It's found in a way where we can talk to the administrators themselves, the technological ones you understand, it's through the recovery of the technological rules and read its presentations on the redddox, so that the administrators themselves, the technologists of you can understand it, has put on three ways of view and connecting to other agencies in the other regulation, and at some point there are many technological rules that are quite incompatible.
Then I need to improve it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the population platforms, the digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in spontaneously all the activities of the recording audience, and the more they will be.
Digital payment is one: Digital payment, electronic card, an interactive sign, a crediting trap, digital identity is an inhabitable trap.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
You will be able to implement technologically all the data of your citizens that at this time are around 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only database is incorrected.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk about the rest of administration applications: when I come across a community at the other side I have to...
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago we made an Akaton Seria.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
Bagfixing, so, submitted problems of software, improving the documentary and even new projects, was carried out in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, it wasn't Italian, but there are many Italians that are helping us from the technological point of view, like the one.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what should be, maybe not.
(Audience) Yes!
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that basically don't get limited to make an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it's good for kids to be composed, to disappoint me, this might be, for example, and it's one of those things which is shortly broken.
When we grow up the Alsa version, Alfa is called digital citizens, it has the phone, smartphone, it has the digital identity, it has data the card of electronic identity, in Nepsi.
It's already functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction of citizens and public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because working on this job we truly do it, but it's different from this vision.
Last few weeks ago, the stamp...
With the next 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited for many people to talk about what they think could happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish?
(Audience) Yes!
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
But a country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, hoping to embrace it.
A country wants to offer technological competitions that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine a country where working for public recording is an wealth, where the children in the better way to work in public research centers, that are seen and proper centers of eccellence and innovation.
Now, it's a dream that leads development to the country.
And that the components to do all this digital process policies, technological processes are really many and maybe too many, but if it's not a dream about which we can hardly be able to do things.
Before I finish, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Take the chance to do it."
(Audience) Yes!
And here it served somewhere in this theater, among the other, to this point, but it is easier, and I managed to explain what I was doing.
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Tini Times to become Digital, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
(Laughter) J: Wow, oh, oh.
And if you wanted information about us, our site and our social issues, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
What would you change?
(Music) Do you want to change, raise your hand to change work, your boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know it's, then raise your hand those who will change some of your body, maybe you lose some threads.
Or maybe you won in muscles?
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom: raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want.
(Laughter) I was sure that I'd all be here, or maybe you'll be one of them who would change partner.
(Sounds) (Laughter)
Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't want to change our partners, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have one more united family, but my parents were not separated.
(Applause)
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
On the twice, I felt the most complex professors, they seemed to me all eyebrows and I reflected in music, here the great voices to make the test room.
Later on the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I had to fight and accept it to try to understand how to change things that didn't move me well, what others thought of me on the biggest economical feasts, on interpersonal relationships with characteristics that I acquired from birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
And these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but since most of the cases were the only three posts of playing in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up maintaining their problems in life.
(Laughter)
The strategy, today, the broadcast, is to get lamented, we get lamented a bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no job, there's traffic, that makes fun, that I'd have done it differently, we regret because there's no injustice.
But I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who wasn't doing anything else to get bothered, from when I started to talk, to when I stopped to return home.
She started lamenting the triumphy, that she left her, and then the girl with whom she helped her, feeling of a value, ability, and here, that the mind had completely colonized her whole daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a little the great temptation, because with a small effort you can obtain a great result, to remove the rule of the victim who is listened, comfortably, helped.
But beware.
You can lament yourself in the night or day, on the streets or with friends, at the high voice or in your mind, can you remember something that already happened or something that maybe a Sunday could happen?
And you can lie to your torto, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to the right, because all of us would have so many reasons to let us lie.
(Laughter) But the truth is that as much as you're forced to regret it hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what's in fasting.
When things are not ready as you see, it's that of lamenting if the strategy of the villages.
Suppose that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Later to the luxury, another very exciting strategy, when things are stretching, it's that of imporciation, it imposes our need.
But based on this mentality there is a growing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work, it's enough to change it.
But from those who are skeptical noises?
Now, you feel a bit dirty, but why can you never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it easy?
Your wife breaks you with strength.
In the fresh, let's get all the risks in the palm.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
And too big, we couldn't conduct him, send him to the psychologist, we are here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, to make the world around you put up with the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, is...
The relationships of coppy.
(Laughter)
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I wasn't doing anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
And he says: "Yes."
It's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in the kinds, and then it's a classicone, and it's not, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you, that always starts with the same stream, and he doesn't know if you've never heard of them for that.
And you, because we need to show all the line of equity of the other, we need to make them see all the problems that should be supposed to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old, but instead of picking up the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy is privileged.
When things don't leave as you wish, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result.
And we thought about a couple of times, because you'll have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
(Audience) Yes!
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there are no tools, like a tool, take the forehead, put it under the ground.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
It's the same thing I want to do.
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of altruistic needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that he was openly driven by confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned some important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, I never learned to say no to the things they didn't care about, I didn't learn to say no to the things they didn't care about, and the need to accept all the many.
It's the strategy that privileges when things don't go as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, you'll finish to disrupt them.
(Laughter) Sading, involving your needs or suffering them, there are three limiting strategies, and I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself a long time in my life, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school I was working for, he called me and said, "Now Zuccelli, here for her, there's no place, it's pleased to keep the collapse with us, to accept a disturb.
And he showed me a far away, expected place, hesitated for the most, besides, I would have to go there to do a job that I didn't even have to do with all that I had studied until then.
So I got to know how to die, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that to obtain different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others ...
It's changing oneself, if I changed.
Also, the others would have to follow, change, change.
If I turned into a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, the primary school wouldn't have sent me a way, and if I had done it, it wouldn't take me more than so much.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
But why are things?
They don't change.
Behind, we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
And choose the places as a cause of things that don't go as a path.
Receive yourself as a cause of things that are not going to happen.
This is our challenge.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll never find myself alone and to help confront something much bigger: I mean, you open your doors in front of you because it defines your responsibility, the gend, you can always decide to speak a new language, if you read books, go to the courses to acquire new abilities, or consolidate those you've already had, it's the basis of the crisis, what you want to do, but if instead of you, and you think that it's perfect, that maybe there's a bank to change a journal.
But because life is from those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
(Laughter) If inside the coppy, things don't go well, do you think there's the other side to where to take the first step?
It is sending them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
Then things change, but don't change in the case, but they change because you know you've changed, I first walked to the research of your little words, what I can do today differently to make your best magazine.
If you are one of those people, if you are one of those people, and thus you create a mental space inside which you can take care of the other, instead of the war.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, prostitute and relaxation.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose meaning and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something else, inside which you can become a role model of the game, and start working on me, considering being a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value to their lives.
But my friends, I met a couple of ...
With problems, stereotypes, prejudices, Jobs are the doctor of the matters, psychologists are the doctor of the debts, but they had to talk to a friend, but they went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
But I'd have to get lamented, or maybe you don't explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
No, I had to.
To learn how to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to people, I had to learn the dynamics of virtual plays, I had to learn how to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn how to listen to their needs.
Instead of having mine.
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do.
(Laughter)
I thought about it, and in the end I decided I would have accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I got to the case, I killed the computer, and I recorded a video that I've cartooned on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here in the head of the pod to pick up the company, because you might think...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the reason of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting to discussing some of the stereotypes that I mentioned earlier.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I am from 79 of Google, psychology in Italy, my magazine, and what left me more than anything, was recognized that the schoolbands at the beginning were able to isolate me.
Because, of course, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something scientific and in Lumbia, was read to the Vice President of Ornesi College.
Dreams do.
[Inglese]: Yes.
But don't become real because, fortunately, or because you had that.
The story you have to have is that which you can hold and carry on, those who don't know how to build and you need to discuss, because guilt should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
Well, if there's something I've learned from all my journey to improve.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For this reason, I've asked you a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't work like you?
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
(Laughter) Well, in chiusure, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least prove us, it's a small question that, personally, it was very useful and based on logic that, in order to produce great changes, it's about concentrating in many actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do now, at the end of the store, with the way back home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions in which you ambite?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
"Geee, you've got the keys to the freelancer, to the Waldimanda!"
The ugly goes off the poth, ugly, but when I put the packs on them, "Fedemma, martians are the provides."
I've made it, but I've knocked on her feet that it's a mutation.
Oh, you see, when my mother arrived... Did you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And I want this time to take it by myself, here.
[A.DE.]
I had a dream.
With diverse and different abilities, creating a integration band, percussions are so fast, so immediate, they access distances and join the battles.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
His kids, I see them, I see, mature, fear, my own.
I saw him growing.
And our provides were the mariday, the mariday was the day of proceed, where this room was entered at the Andreoli School.
(Laughter) They were picking the first bidonies, they were together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become a group marathon, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical sights and saw the first ones, the first weddings in the fire.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012 the beloved world came across.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a huge earthquake full of our earth.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were no longer updated.
Many believe that our living provides, our place where all marriages were completely different.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
The endless cake and the rocks.
Have we done it?
Luckily, we all found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manitis, of military purposes.
Within that tunnel ...
There were magnificent things.
But we've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the banding a book puts them stronger in the earthquake: it kept us in the eyes, with the Earth that washed, to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
There, inside, we've built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
They became the shelves, the tubes that became...
From tools constructed and combined with ping pong roots, to take out bills with big and houses, shoot.
And we were in a continuous job, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
(Audience) Yes.
Already inside is born our first spettacol, we decided to put a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to speak the way we saw, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man, at that moment, they all moved together as a white man.
After a while, we did the year later, we did the other spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also have a moment from our land, to breathe for a moment, and the year after we had cracks, this sea show, immediately after...
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought that a tone could change our lives.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
To me, in the end, are you ending?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
(Audience): Yes.
150 concerts in return to education.
The dove of the first magician is the dove of the first magician.
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
It's the kindergarten stage, right?
And we really did a lot.
And they also give me the hugs, because that's exactly what I'm talking about.
It's exactly the life's circumstances, the fatal, the sudden, but also the freshness, that has so many chances in the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
That there's still so many...
To build, (Applause) Thank you all.
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until the moment I've been taught that there is this social innovation, we talk about social innovation, and my question is what has happened in the last 25 years?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate these digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
But this is the digital metaphor: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, I believe almost everyone.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, in some way, consistently in the year 2000, that we are living today, and the computer belongs, instead, and the phone is a solution to the Internet, and conness, and once again this is an invention of the revolution of the internal revolution.
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the broadcast on the Internet, we considered it an iron.
What was my studies?
I'm in some school books, but it wasn't only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we are huge debates, usually advertisers, for example, because we need the coast bike.
And the vapore mask is not only a vapore mask, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored, and it became much faster, the estation of carbon dioxide, and the rising possible to a significantly lower cost, and then the vapore motorcycle entered into the phones and started to change the modality that they fathize.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
The motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanican invention and Italian invention, the motorcycle is broken.
And we need, for example, the automobility industry: Actually, it was used for the naval industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motorcycle that could not go from far away, when they were able to understand how to make the farm to accumulate it as well as dumb and poisoned with the spreading that developed the automobility industry, and all that was derived.
At the Industrial Revolution, we are still debates for example for the phone, but not only: the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part of the world that is always smaller than we knew.
But it's also what permits us, and it has taught us, to the deposit of the caves ...
With the sea, and yes, because then you can see the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what we did, we interrupted everything.
No, we went on going on caves under the sea, and we were around 1858, the first cave to give a storic dimension was taken from many places between Mexico and articulated art, not only two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave went there.
On the other hand, the phone, the phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 homes in Rome, is only 1877.
Another invention is electric energy, the first electric power plant, continental in Europe, was built by Santa Radagonda, where the Rinascente Milano is.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
A part of our history has swimmed from there.
But let's move forward, let's try to make rooms that are still throughout history, but that has already experienced important features and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to leave something, to compose something that has never happened before: they're the computer, they're the collectors.
By the factors who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stance like this, and had marriage functions, just made the calculus lighter.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, he decided to open these dirty letters, but he couldn't land because they were under the ground, but landing because they hadn't known, but in those 50 years of the Internet revolution happened else.
And these responses called ARPA, the ARPANET network, became, started to be, the World Web, which we know, a broadcast and spontal system, non-chemical, and extremely captured, capable of bringing information of collecting information in 1995 and were 25 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
Well, when the robotic strength, as I say, has been introduced to the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility.
And, the Internet, and this according to a phenomenon of disruption, of creative education, that we're living now, the one that's called Internet, we've had the horizon that if we little began to live the horizon we've lived now.
And this is an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively disturbs what is old, because it needs to make space, and we'll see better how it is, but this is the story of the great numbers, try to support you.
When, little by little, I haven't done the Italians yet, it was 1863.
Minister Minghetti, put an end to Inghetti, established that 27th century of the judge is correct, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months after this happened, in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most of all, it has transformed the economic power of the power of production of goods and goods in the power of producing one: well, the money.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to keep in mass media, in structured way, in a healthy way, in the quantity of food, has been the frigerator.
So there is also the chance, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the emergence of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live towards the speed of challenges, the speed of movements, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is, a element that we can define as the qualificator of these years, in the middle of time, as we said, arrived on the computer and arrived on the internet, we, 25 years ago, we didn't have speed as we are today.
And until when something happened, it's typically close when you keep the story of seeing the passages from one seventh to another and sharing some date that aren't necessarily 0 -0: 2001.
And the American economy started to slow down, and there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance began to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were running to be very fragile.
But we moved forward until there was something that normally happened, and the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there was only America to rise, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
Instead, there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was already overwhelming, they didn't talk about it, but it's still there, and something changed, but what has changed, has changed the economic paradigm, we couldn't we?
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis, which was effectively verified in 2008; it was crazy, we didn't think, but how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension?
With many fewer people.
What did these companies do, they didn't innovate, and it was obvious that it would happen: we were certain in most of them, looking at the companies, but above all, all the companies that were before 2011.
They were inventing something that was not before, but they started doing what we've always done, buy, travel, learn, learn in a different way, in a more efficient way.
We are ten percentual features under the average, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection for the 50th century: we try to look at the health of digital tales, according to five factors, economical abilities, digital systems, those that allow us to develop.
Behind, a third fact that we must look is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it, a third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, eating or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The public administration system: we immediately get the field of some ambiguity, and we keep both important and most of all a good news: everyone, every five element is growing.
I'm all five elements that are growing up, at a speed of growth completely up until two years ago, so we've been attending European countries, and this doesn't mean anything.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we should look at very carefully that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the abilities and digital inclusion in the productive factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
It's what happened most in the '50s, and it's the first medals.
Let'songe on being the smallest printing media, something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't paragonable to large internationals.
But they are probably the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
(Laughter) You know how to do something extraordinary, "Made in Italy," they have a quality, an eccellence in the production of service in the product, which is quite united in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, abilities inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve.
An interaction of the market in an extraordinary way, creating ricks for all the people around us: a nature, nature, nature, her artistic heritage, and this is the first asy we have, the first great motorbike that the hospital, and her cultural artistic heritage.
But is it possible that tourists only live in three cities?
Venezuela, RA and then Remember, I believe this is your great endeavor that we can do to our Italy, but the richest of these three cities don't make the richness of our country, thank you.
(Music)
(Applause) The reason I spoke about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word "funific".
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
With a question.
But if someone asked you: to complain, according to you, in the last 15 or 20 years, we will say, in the 21st century, inequality in the world, inequality in the world's citizens have increased or are decreased.
But I believe the majority of you would answer were increased: if then, maybe journalists, maybe they would add the precious approach, they've increased exponentially.
And if I asked you, "But and in Italy, maybe the answer of many would be too?"
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the results of video.
I'm prepared with my colleagues, a remind of the inequalities from when they are data, which means that funding from 1960 for the highest majority of countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
And in Italy, after the end of the 20th century, at the end of the 90s, the compulsive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated now we are at the storic mining.
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
(Laughter) We have a rather decreasing disguection.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible letture is to say: we've put a complete alcohol in order to keep talking about years of increase in inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask ourselves another question, and if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are myself.
Let's move?
(Laughter) The feeling wasn't wrong, but the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Can you imagine that?
But we need to reflect on the reasons of inequality, what we try to say about inequality.
Maybe the thing of inequality actually requires some rhythm.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And we also moved to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
That was Cambridge, a speech came out in front of me.
To a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, the first says: in that occasion, Keynes forms two professors.
It was a seventh, the product.
(Laughter) A friend of mine will be... Audience: War.
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this exchange, indeed, has become realised, because if you're about to engage...
The rich farming of the economy, in fact, in most of the society's advanced society, we have an increase in productivity at the age of 100 years that even in advanced society.
Of course, twelve times, in some 15 occasions, so this profile was realised, but from this professor Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
Little by little, I think that there, in the meantime to 100 years, it would be found with a huge amount of time free that would allow them to work less than less.
He also spoke, he was also working on everybody, and he saw him a problem for that, because the question that Keynesse was in, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
Well, well?
Apparently, your second feature didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
I'm going to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first time we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not realised anywhere, let's see what happened in Italy.
This one...
The curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
Throughout his life life, his life naturally working force, that means that for 15 years, when we are able to have a job, and if we keep this commitment, Keynesi's professor is fulfilled, because we reached around 16%.
I have two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Naturally?
If this has happened, there are reasons too.
But there's another reason, maybe more important for every survival and if you want a banal, for example the elderly is highly tackled, then very positive, and other bananas, if you want, are even studying up to 25 and 30 years, so young age is burned.
Our quote of time ...
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
This richest for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see that...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 scary missions, but from 1968 and we've accepted one year.
The occupation rate has always been lower than 50%.
But a rate of occupation goes down to 50%.
What does that mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income are more than workers.
In front of this?
Farming action: can we also have a reaction?
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States.
Thank you.
In Italy.
Testing units.
This is the storic series of time.
I have dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, in the United States it's only up to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while we believe, but even more impressive, and the storage number of the management rate, because here we see.
Which has even an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general assistance in the USA ratio, and in our case, we have a situation.
Riduation.
of the occupation taste.
But then, this idea of learning is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most people live in a condition that I defined -
Parassitary dependency, because depending on the website of Twisia, this can also be a family member or State, but would parassize because I'm consuming or the available net without working.
I, a friend who did theater's work, when I found these results, we went to the scene and I asked them.
How did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parassitary dependence, and you know what answered to me?
With Epopopopotam, this hell that lives on the backs of the Epopopotham, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
Well, we have this film: the buffer or the buffaga on thepotam, or on the other big mammals, these panels also live on the rinocerontes, on the buffs.
Why will it be there for some seconds in which you see?
These are the ones.
The animals, these murderers.
The mistake may mean that the bufal is hidden in the ears, as they live byassing on the resources that the bowl provides, that they are insisted, larvae, ze, that everything we host on the owner of the wetlands.
Anyway, this is sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
Another thing is how can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers and a minority of producers?
There is this kind of improductive consumption that I've been told before, but is this the signal society?
And society, signals, like feudal society in which there is a blind ceiling, that has put in the conditions of living without work.
(Laughter) But naturally, it's not enough: we must add a qualification: this is, indeed, a conviction.
That it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
"Yeah."
Because consumers are more than producers.
In the signural society is simple: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the aim of defining a relationship of female enthusiasm, we can see why, doppy legs, because society is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission, in the signal society and the producers is much more complicated.
The relationship?
The buffer with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it also depends on the food that is there.
Free faces indicate an avenge on the backs of the hypothomo.
And also from the view of the producers, we came back to a green light, a green light, the Epopopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need the buffer.
But in some way, in a memory of obligation, as we are, in the faces of color that we keep, because we can't provide them, we can't nourish the animals that live on our homes, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of damaging, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
(Audience) Yes!
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we come to the question that I've done for Keynes's education: today, perhaps, the real inequality and inequality in access to work.
The access to work is very asmetrical in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools of analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent coherent concentration of gins that the tool with which we measure from inequality we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic.
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we will probably be the palm of this graduator.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
As we arrived at this, this is the history of inequality in access to work in Italy, always measured with the efficient decent, you can see somethingamorous, that inequality is minimum during the monarchical age, especially under the second Republic, the jobs in more, our families than the one we live in.
Throughout a month, in addition, we'd have 12,000 euro round around the year, and our state would have around 150 billion euros, as much as health and school costs together, more or less in Italy.
What?
We also had the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution: "School is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
So, we change things.
And we create the 7 million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to spot the article one of the Constitution, because things are like BEFA.
Thank you. (Applause)
