(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently so far away: Be, you must know that, until some time, my two largest children, Mars and French?
And...
To fall asleep they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
The words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years pass, the child becomes a man ...
But we suffer a lot, a lot about this problem of the embarrassment: it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, psychologists, all brave people, brave professionals, but nobody can do it.
To take this incase.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune, isn't it?
Take a look at a little girl.
His name was Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
Would I look for a child?
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Mrs. Teresa," but what beautiful words of freedom?
And then...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting?
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, can you imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor?
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the battles he had written, the comic fights, was too big and he didn't think about it.
He got free of the barbecue, took the seventh microphone, and everybody went out, I was a computer engineer, you think I was so brave in the Internet than my first words just before were: web, web!
That's how it happened.
People were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That this young man, at that time, was that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And after all, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mother would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility...
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What's a moment, I talk about my flexibility and they take away the best part.
This also works the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
The 21st trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, that's an obsession, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) the dotted - and that's an applause, maybe he didn't understand - trisomy 21 - it's the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "A misery carrier, we don't even know what we were able to do the NELA mask, but it's dark."
(Laughter) We have given the doctor's thesis to the doctor's because ... (Applause) It's us.
(Applause)
We searched a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in the world.
I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyway, after a few months.
Anna has arrived, it's the present, it's a marvelous one, it's very beautiful, it's also strong.
I admit that mine is somehow a judgment, you understood it.
It's even the most beautiful thing that has brought to our families.
Very wonderful is that it has been all the best people, it has become better to me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, somehow, find us.
What if this isn't the power?
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, by analysis.
We know everything, but few, very few of these people, have had encounters with people.
Hondisability: and then, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone news" and "Second Anna," where so, without asking too much serious, but exactly for nothing, ancient say.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, a little while ago, Francesca came home," saying, you know that they use one as an officer at school.
So this part is here.
Or another one, where she says, "But it's true that you suffer from Down syndrome and you don't give birth to blue eyes," "Bella, this is said with Down syndrome," because we believe that words also have their importance.
Have you made a small X?
(Applause) No, why I give you this example, because you, today, for ... (Applause)
Following TED, talking to people, you've done a bit of fatal, and here's the invitation: make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life, as individuals, as well as people around you.
A very shortcut, but ...
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to give us a step forward.
A blow clock under: Here, to wake up the eyes you have to put yourself at the same level, and in this sense it captivates me a lot of times of losing, that's why I like a politician to leave briefs behind my stories.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to try to trace disability.
In your life, to enroll them, and especially ...
And remember that the pairs...
What can you look at the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who lives, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And maybe many of you have already captured those reports, and I've understood what my mission in the world was, in fact, it wasn't born for a bunch of birds, or for a romantic disorder, as some of you remembered before, but for an ortagge.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I'd have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out and try to make the world a little more sustainable, just leaving food.
But why food?
Food, the things we can decide, for us, for our family, every single day, and not only, so, it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices that each day produce a large part of our daily environmental impact.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
But my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that is environmental impairment, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
And then, obviously, to try to use 100% of the raw materials.
The thing of consumers, also of optimizing consumers, is especially the way in which we compose theattoo every day, theattoo, so, what do we, effectively, bring to the table?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
The scarce, so the less noble part, is in average to at least 50% in winter, reaches up to 70 percent, because so many vegetables...
They have more protected parts, so what to optimize in the kitchen means changing food, that is to use 100% of the raw materials, but it's not simply about regaining these things?
To reject is to have a different approach, to see all these parts as a group, let's take an example with the window: "I can see it like ..."
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
With this implication, I made chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us a cake, a cake.
And it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit certainly for the health: this is just an example with a product that should be familiar with, to love 100% believing: for example, zucca, I really like it because the sewing is the only noble part, it's the one where most of them concentrates, the trunk is focused, and lets it at home, but it allows transform and value with a different approach.
In addition to that, or every time I use an appliance like the vast, but also to cure it, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that someone of you is turning smooth, but it's a very high cup of high cup, low temperature, so it doesn't occur to you simply use the vast food, and every time you're wearing it, how do you do it?
It's a very practical example: you take a glass like this, you must be hermetic, let yourself, for example, a new, covered with water and you get well, and you can stand it in middle of the matches, then when we were in war, okay, there was a wall of food, we had a lot of patates, of pollution.
And really, when they could put the keyboard, for example, the candles, the protective jokes, it was a party, and it was like this: now, the problem is opposite, we have so much discomfort, and we have a little tendency to put all of us in touch the doppy of proteins that are useful to us, because it's a problem.
To change more than what is used is a waste of resources, it is certainly something that we could improve if more proteins are animal proteins that have certainly an environmental impact.
To also say, riding, to reduce our environmental impact, and above all try to eat them as quality, and more likely, to put a few fewer proteins in theattoo, that maybe try to convince all of you to completely drop out the products of the home, and probably for society, I think it would be important that we all put together a few less proteins in theattoo.
Those of you will be wondering, well, in the next year we'll also have HECPO, and there's a protein food, which is absolutely zero, which, furthermore, we can feed vegetables scars, maybe not the ones we'll wear to the household, but the things, perhaps, we can't use the food of the future, but more self-protecting.
I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten the lights?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, there was more foodmen than an athlete, about 35 years ago a law stops us from collecting them.
We have so much to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, we just need to know how to do it: to give your hands the sum that at home is enough a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of earth, a queen, to avoid it escaping.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to get rid of the water, or you can pick uova, and then feed it with vegetables, so it's even more to smoke food waste.
And twice a year, you will have your recipe in your own spring, like an ortag, the French sewages or ricks more of a stranger, surely can have satisfaction, and there is meat between the other side of fats, that has a lot of benefits, and it can, in my opinion, not only food of the future, but also food of the present, hope ...
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they will never eat them, of course they require a small change of mentality and the surpassing of prejudices, so unit of me will become revolutionary, because benefits are really many, are for our happiness and the planet, thank you.
breast, breast, well.
I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six gangs, you fell from one to the other: the other has gone with ten gangs, if I give it any value from one to ten to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you'll launch your side for ten gangs.
I, the one you know: bring this game, put an equal or largest number of mine.
(Audience) Yes!
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
To win with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory.
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
With a bit of peace starts and a lot of lights, I realized that the Vitoria Province was approaching 75%.
(Laughter) With the random increase, my stomach based on the average of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
But your portable has to deliver to release the number of 100 million data in just one second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the risks in mathematical problem, is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
(Laughter) To dare to answer the data game, a pure mathematician would remind the Monte Carlo, un elegant method as if we were abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To me, it's rather a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, in the Borrik Unit in Inghilterra.
Now I'll give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, my workplace, a supercomputer, seminars and conferences are at the orders of the day.
And the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competition and unbearable humanity.
(Audience) Yes!
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
But I spend most of my time alone on front of a computer or on a statistical background.
That's not the case.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion that I wasn't seen before.
So, here in movement, there's a topic that is based on an argument from a mathematician that studies west, but I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than we were, paralyzed.
In a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
(Laughter) And so on, they think they're teaching math and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
Then I said, "But...
With that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, all that I had left before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't care to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's why I accepted my degree, I started to live in lessons, I tried to take advantage of every opportunity, I got a diploma, in college data, and make them fun.
(Laughter) The fathers were the job positions, more than so much efficient, strong and determined.
And then, it wasn't about work for me.
I did reviewing at every aspect of learning, preparing the process is a creative, stimulating process, a form of art.
I really like to correct the contents: to read the readers' reads, right tricky they are, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman.
What about the waves?
My favorite, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) Around the students who paid for my whole bill, and I was talking about them, how much they were learning about me.
As a young researcher, during the third year, came up with a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the reward for the influence of education.
(Laughter) In the cost of my PhD, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way.
But everything was so natural, beautiful, closer.
[A.H.]
In my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into place.
That's how I talked to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is that the reason for all this euphoria, fuel, those limitings of determination?
The answer I gave was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, of the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
A concert ... Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind was ready to move exactly at a moment in which I had tried to put the lies of my students in motion.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Laughter) As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great.
But the university is not the only place where mathematics and communication meet to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But are we not going to see?
This captain of my story has told you, because I think that what I learned is shared.
A methodology of Monte Calla Parte, for example, was to undertake a path that didn't liberate what we thought, or even find motivation in the street that there were no expectations, and then passionate about how to catalize our talents and the share culture.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
I invite you to read.
(Applause)
It's the preparation of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
I enter a good eye, I laugh and cathed it, my three colorful penels were cold.
At its care of the time, I turn off the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise will also be prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some attention to design questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to witnessed the friends of five years old, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have instructions.
Another guy, a few seconds ago, asks me where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had very little time for this practice, but there's a lot of material online, and there's a place to show it on the rear of the diagram.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
And I scratch to the washing machine, but it often came to me with them to ask how to procedure, every point of practice we put together a element of theory that we repeat the stages together.
Anyone makes a very difficult question, but I had spent the dinner of their gender book, I was well prepared, I had it.
(Laughter) I stand with them to make them take the spiral.
It's a saying, come on, I invite you to get to the magnifying glass for the exam, a group of students get close, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
(Laughter) An ultimate student approaches me.
And I chose.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
(Laughter) Anyway!
It's me brave enough, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
(Sigh) I only live in class, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe this is exactly my place in this world.
(Music) Here, this is what I want to tell you: "My heart is worthy, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside the pitch." (Applause) Thank you.
Besides growing from the bathrooms ... (Music) Dal 2003, the Movember between a Disson, financed with a research on the cancer of prostate, over 29 million dollar, and sustained by the scope of promoting the dialog and the refocus for the massive health programs.
I try, #Movender asking our love to donate on a better model, the research came to Vander, lives in Espetto, we held research, put our baths together, we put our selfies and shared it, #Creto.
(Applause)
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, so a little bit like Jesco saw in a bar by a book.
And as often the captain, when I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me out of others, started to listen to different conversations.
What was talking about change, she said to her, "We must change your attitude, you should do this, in other words, change."
It was a central theme, Samatina, my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
You feel your diversity, you experience your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing then?"
It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know how to go out, and the opportunity seems its data instead of diversity.
Everything that brought a different one, remember, one day my daughter ... Yes!
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of friends, gay. So, at some point, we were dinner and said, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, Carlo, are we really three men?
And she says, "No, no, her two, you know with mom."
I guarantee you: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, and I say, "Well, Carlo, they love them both?"
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the straight below.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, that I've worked for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
Then, when I drink this pen, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States to write on paper.
The word change accounts this word of change, I get a thinking that's given to me - I don't know how many hours - and it begins to put into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and forming an encouragement, cake.
[A.DE.]
Kaching, which, in fact, is a presa, is a bit of fulfillment that, for me, of course, is a prosecutive of my personal whole.
A leader today must have, which means must know how to stay, must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an act, it is a creative transformation and change.
What's the new element here, at least for me?
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis, the prospective change, what is it?
But what I thought was to take this leap, to do things, to deliver roles, make projects, bring people from one part to another to be, and all that I do thank you.
What about the development of creative thinking, which leads her to move through this transformation?
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
Then, this model we've imagined, then, through five fundamental purposes, the first one would know about transformation.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists, or someone who may maybe take care of ads, rather than communication, but creativity is something that affects everyone, through the environment you are in.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can join your creativity, what you do with creative thinking, try to work on divergent and convergent thinking, but that's not enough.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, so starting to involve that which is the emotional part, the face of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
This is, to precisely encourage the absence of sex to your emotions.
Those forces that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel fear, that when you feel that it's not courageous, and to take the leap, and don't do it, it's also those, when you are aware of your emotions, you can allow you to support judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing this ...
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a change of rule, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotion gives you to do this.
I'd like to mention the numerous examples of leader who have done these reports, just to get to the countryside, certainly deserve marriages with Rome, but also those with Milano, you know that they're awarded at the other day, like the world's major estension company, including innovation and is growing up to 67%.
Verees change towards how to say inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and thus the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of speaking.
Opportunity, we say in management, create the weather, but I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create other things.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can, as to say, relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and this is not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were collected in one way: "Wow, but dare!
To the leaders the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, it also offers the opportunity to do that, to explore new ways.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
And there, a competition begins, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, it's better that I don't say it, it's better that I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins.
Then, what's interesting when we get to this situation is exactly: how do I do it?
Will I convince me to collect creative spirit?
And who?
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, that necessarily ...
It doesn't laugh if they've been organized, even if they've reinvented a very customer relationship.
The prosecutive is completely changed, so to get back to that original cave.
So, the idea is exactly ...
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To find ourselves in the situation of being aware, to expand the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a way of liberating to say in which way today I can be curious, in that way, by looking at people, I can find something that isn't so comprehensive.
So the sense of attention we have seen in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking, but this assumes clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but especially that of creating a mental space.
To make things happen first inside you and then out, so in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We're about to land, to drop your confidence belts.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance to see from above.
The most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcasting of the human.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years ...
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And the forehead will have come to you.
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money in this city.
I understand what we call the longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process is obviously the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what today captivates you when you did your weekend to New York or to Parigi.
Imagine.
They used to be strade, without leaves, without poverty.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that caractic packs prevented one with the other.
And, of course, both writes with the book, which was called the operating class in the city.
In which the cities of all the bad guys in the world were the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible, as to say.
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from this ...
Behind, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
There are also tools to limit this phenomenon which is clearly the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
A typical thing you see here behind.
And the tremendous thing that, maybe you've ever heard about, which has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock for which, when you've changed a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the place where you can imagine...
The future of a city, what had to happen in the future, here a trade, here a house, just him, is only in your forehead, or even, and ultimately, the zonization that fortunately you've never met, everyone, but who even gets to say.
It's a theater.
(Laughter) And then, we also imagine films, the culture that impacts a lot in the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence and iron, whiten by abandoning it, and maybe because you've seen the movie, that you remember, becomes a prison where all the world's goal are launched by thealto and scanned forever.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all the processes, this was also for example a little lungh in 1845, there was a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
This is the solution to all the big questions related to human beings.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability, safety, economic development, work creation.
The ability ...
In fact, this feeling is also about creating knowledge.
Importing?
The foundations that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world, the first one.
It's the density, you can see myallel, my photo made from the upset of my city.
And the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can stay in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks and others who also ignore the name of the most famous calling.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
And then?
Here's my idea: the city as a solution is, in some way, add to the end.
It's really a mechanism.
The city's definition is no longer: mass, people, we're all used to confronting this other city for the residents, for the vast, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
And the city works, will solve the greatest question of humanity?
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive at a magically understanding of individual interests in the collective well-being and therefore, the definition of the city is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
"Why?"
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Or others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that in this moment or in some periods?
You begin to be...
This virtuous mechanism, and then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We have to move from mechanisms of human content tool to mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and that they are not afraid.
And it's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what close?
To feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example is Mility.
(Audience) Yes!
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From these satellites and some relatives are evident, not all of us, but ...
A group of green, unknown, in the city center, ten minutes per meter, from man.
That was my idea together.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, going back to the city.
Liber is from...
to name this group of green, courageous, because it's believed in the city.
And that, going to see the city maps, for example, you can imagine the urban setting, the largest in the world, 72 km green, an orbitial frame that can be seen every day as an element of diversity and strength.
Creding!
In the positive things of the systems we live in.
Don't let us, let's say...
First of the lack of solution, cities like natives, to discuss, from traffic reform, which still has 9 cents.
It comes to the cement.
And the second example, and now this, I don't know if you all have this historic mind.
in a city.
A few billion km from here we have worked, it's called Buenos Aires, Argentina, the capital, and it's put a quesit in a few years ago.
What can we do from this city in 2030 with all of the adventures: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance, but this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, was in some way unbeared.
However, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation what was it?
Do you eat alone?
The feeling of limiting the development, and instead of courage, sparing the break, with the same ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
Third strategy.
What's happening is development, and I see qualified a huge amount of intensity, that is, a huge population.
Most infrastructure and the creation of spaces, pedestals, or wages, you can see this ...
It's density, the piano is ripped in 2030 and we shouldn't limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build...
Situing?
Wearday more basis with more dense rooms?
Changing the population not only of the agency, but also of the whole world and the creativity to get together.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
Also...
I am sure that allows us to increasingly believe in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
Those spaces of sociality.
What spaces?
Diver and pedonals.
And these three stratags together were working on the development of Buenos Aires.
We know that the cities...
I'm the solution to all the world, OK?
When...
Ancorates a time.
Atterrete.
And maybe choosing the position at the end, you will see it from the upset, this great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe...
You are willing to live in what I call, the section of the city.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause)
The words are important.
They put us in ideation.
It wasn't our thoughts.
The loss of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They're evocating that they're full of stories and vibrations, of emotion.
I'm a son.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
And it's true that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Again.
And I said to myself, "Perfect."
I'll talk about it in a mountain way.
In English, the provincial mixing and motivated many times dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But did he get a bit like this?
And will I start to show you?
Some negative twists.
They were motivated, among the segments and the means of an university in the world.
And they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a cone, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana.
It's incodeous.
Indigenous.
In Svetia.
In the leg united to the Kins College de Ronda, on the coat united Oxford.
In Chicago, in the United States.
Albert says "written" in his insurance, not just universities.
Honestly.
Dichiarian, if it's in Latin, eh?
Londra has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
Kinsler, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: "The American marine says, "Pleaseennium, if you have witnessed it, it's always true."
In a thousand movies, British marine speaks in Latin, and even a prostitution there is no stone to be a passwoman.
Like NASA.
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
Why am I doing it so late with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
"Yeah!"
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What is the recent marriage of the Rome city, has proven and launched the Human municipalities?
And that ... (Laughter)
It doesn't even understand how we should say it, (Inglese) "I've done it."
"Wow, manu?"
What is this amplitude of allegae?
What is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two leaves that give sense to each of us, what are the five pallets high?
(Laughter) (Applause)
And one is asked.
But why, but because at the moment that I take, if we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there's no one who makes the insensite thing to settle their name.
I was promising.
It's no part of it.
Just Doma.
"Daddy, dad, you have your penetration."
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
Little snacks!
[A.DE.]
Oh, the Ministry of Benicuto, you've seen it beautiful!
Gonta?
(Laughter) No, it's not very nice to see, Beautiful, let's put it Italian people in a way of insensitated.
Well, I don't like us, I don't even like nonsense, which is the thing.
It's curious, it's this one.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
Stoized in Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic ancestors, in this symptom.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses, study, or because they love it.
For the pool, for the opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
I know what I did.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, "You're more male."
You can't.
For example, pizza.
It achieved the world continuing to call us pizza.
Here you see the map of the pizzeries in the United States, facing the map of negotiations that sell to bug or...
Watson brings the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And she says "Pizza."
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
Here it is.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote the week of Italian wine, I say, "OK!"
Why the distant ones from New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
Wow!
But...
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's take the reason, let's talk about fashion.
This is what works at the Italian River's office.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the Winter Flow.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
[A.DE.]
Please stand up and ask you who has told me.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) Don't think about it as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon.
And not "We are."
Like they are at our Devenery.
And the women we see in our mental births.
Why, "you"?
But there are no curves.
We dare to talk about publicities, old people, adertising, anyway, this one ...
It's the publicity of a vecture of not in Spain and speaking, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment in the bedsima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy and it speaks English.
(Laughter) There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"What's going on, what if the unionacks perfectly?"
It says, "Let's use our radicies that we call "chi."
The Argentinians say, "I'm on the Internet."
There are no more unions.
She says it sounds catital, isn't it?
We are segmented.
Well, the curious thing, because over two Italians on two no, no?
I don't like the word "inglee."
And 60% of 2012 we say, this is not 58 so we don't know English, we don't know how a country, and we can see it.
(Laughter) Well, let's hope that medical abilities of the sign will happen.
It's compiled by the sign who has compiled this formula's model, as an advantage of linguistic competitions.
Or, every day, for fire, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are self-vincial.
We use a quantity of English words.
There's no one.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasion, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The nazzle is the "locker" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must create a set of lines of lines joining in the caste to be satisfied.
With business, it's united.
When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this gang on the clicket service, because then the unite business is always kind, white and general.
[A.DE.]
(Applause)
It says "glese" and "mails" only talk about it in companies, but also in media, public administration.
The Govern.
We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset didn't have much fun.
And I have forced the pictures of Giobatt's newspapers, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We made a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
"Wow, that's it!
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman wedding?
And I added:
I had to do something: communicating my marriage, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To raise awareness and activism in this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
I'm a bit of energy.
This petition?
who invented it.
Mindical records, the government, the companies, the media, say it in Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it did, became protagonist of this sensitationalization company: did we expect?
A discovery point.
But not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting names, names, nurses, nurses, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, polygloppies and people who didn't spouse that the engineer has signed directors and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed meetings and professionals and called pensioners, signed.
Italians came to the west and said, "What are we doing with our language and they signed a story in Italy?"
To a movie is the whole world.
From Singapore, from Jewels Lee, it gives me "Peduda," "Chudafrica," "Dando de África."
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
Open.
To look at these signs that grew up and to read their motivations.
I'd like to make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a twist, we are in the novel of flash, if we think abundantly, we talk about other tango scoritably, working in a public recording, helping.
"Film, because I've studied classic studies, "Go a job with economists."
I've been living in fashion, I've received a retirement app, it's not from IPRV, from the trend - I don't think there's anything - (Laughter) an Italian and an English decent is better than a Sisher.
And we know how we rhythm speaking.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but Italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
(Laughter) So I started to let me talk about our language decades, because I would never like to say, "Senty Diaign and Functional that spins of occasion."
For Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, Paese, Bianjares, Bernata, I'm proud of smelling relatives who don't know how to speak about sounds are tables.
But there's the bottle of Profile companio, and that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
"I'm filming because I don't know the insult" (Laughter) (Applause)
That's why I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, it's 85 years old.
Thanks to all the words.
Here, I said to you: an extraordinary ecosystem transversing, because in mass communication, this thing dropped to zero cost, on the Internet.
And the un amplified one.
And this initiative is used in over 130 little over the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable.
They talked to them together, grammarines and silk on the paper only about publicity, they were worth many applause, and they were also part of employment and selling them.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
Have you ever spoken about Christian family, the Turing's menchine, hasn't spoken today that the behind has made a heritage: a transversality?
"Ca!"
And that it is all the usual tree, also a little here and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and put them to the most populated ones.
And many times, I'm the great wish to tune ourselves with the taste and consciousness of our language.
This thing was finished in interactions, and it also supported to put me the IPO, it was taken on the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, by a candle.
Well!
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the spiral and bring it to the world because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
No to the e-mail.
And then, he was called Leonardo.
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonaldo himself defined "Homo Sanza Litter."
I was saying "involgata" in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
(Laughter) We resign, expresses one of those feature.
Delefletics!
The magnificent potential of our specifically Italian creativity.
It's the 10 in your language, Matte.
What's more, if our linguistic status is strong and used to it, we can attach some term strange, why personality?
But we must embark on this thesis which is not fully and logical.
From lack of sex to excess.
To finish, or to evil, why do I say this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) What does it mean to be a young player?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
I started to look bad if still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young woman, like everybody went to school, I ran around and fought with friends, but what is behind these photos that you don't see?
I'd like to tell you about the dead part of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back and reclaim...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
[Inglese] Buongiorno.
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called the health problem, and when one of them matches, in both parents, and you're still a child, a teenager, they're your points of dissemination, it becomes really complicated.
[A.DE.]
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
(Applause)
A child's affection can be very heavy, fear, fear, anger, sadness, and love, hatred that they all have: the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
And the difficulty to focus?
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But in addition to this, we could manage windows and their emergencies, without anyone preparing to do it, or even attend, pay attention to suicide attacks.
But how do we add all this?
Further afterwards, even doing the life of always, going to school, studying, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another goal, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your good mother, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, it's hard for somebody to think it will be for that, or it will remind you of parents' problems or deaf people.
It's hard for somebody to consider you as a genetically committed and determined to edit the same discourse.
But if you try to say that your mom or your mother have a shepherd disorder, a bipolar a schizophrenia, or if there's even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, mum, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Today, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a way to understand what happens inside you and your own love.
The curiosity of asking and receiving food many times doesn't get in touch with a cure, and for you who are a child, the load becomes even more heavy.
That's not the case.
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside you and family members, stigma, prejudice, envyment can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside fear, rage, and pain, and to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade started to open in that hill when, for the first time, light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consulte who was the first person outside the family, who read the Internet on the forum, the stories of other children, other countries, thanks to the love for the crazy people who had brought my parents to me.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
But it's statistically impossible, in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to be one, that there is no other who has lived the same things we've experienced, and you know why it happens that our children's stories don't talk about.
But through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've tried and understand that were natural the reactions I've experienced, but I've also been able to see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path by myself, and I went to see in Canada, for the first conference I spoke about, to meet these children, to talk to them, and it was a moment of positive or powerful, because their view, the story I had experienced, but also that, even to write, their value, but also the ability to transform the pain together for a change.
It's an immense desire that needs everybody's help, because I still have energy, and it's an owner that I've strongly decided to bring in Italy, in Europe, to help other burdens, other children forgotten to be able to take off their thoughts from their homes.
How not to stop caricating the world's weight over my shoulders, and that's how we arrive today in 2017 with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association, created by children for other children, and it's called "Come, PCilder and Noff Mentaly, Parence, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
And it's a project that has come out of low, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of you are here in this room now, who have grown up in this same desire, gave us the challenge to start, for parents' children, with a mental disorder.
Initially, when I thought about this project, another wish we have is the idea of another desire we have and this, I believe of another desire we have and the desire to tell, during a trip, in ten minutes, the story, and now we managed to get to so many regions, from the back to Sicily and the Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach them all, and find these people in the civil society, who, perhaps, haven't experienced this experience that has become our own positions in the change.
You can have a marriage of atoms to face those that are positive and negative emotions, the life's face, leaving markets, before you are too bad, to save the quickly.
(Audience) Yes!
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
It's something I know.
And one of the positive characteristics that our parents' parents with mental disorder has is willing to change their scope, and that's why I know that the boys will make them fulfill their desire, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open to us, and let's use the light, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Laughter)
Aron Sfarz, when they dedicated a documentary last year, last year in 2014 the year encouraged by the Internet on-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I will surely play a hacker in common sense.
And an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
C: At the age of 14, they were in a group that read RSSS, maybe you don't say much about it, but it was ugly in the framework until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
(Laughter) When I was about 20 years, I became a small start-up to build something connected to something called a reddit, I became a millionaire from one day to another; but they, honestly, didn't take so much money or fame, they still do what they've always done to build an open and collaborative Internet.
Although with the Internet archaive and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving Tabyte and internet tavyers, which are induced, they are archives of digital memory.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high school law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do monopoly, to go to play-out, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What in the sand is absolutely overwhelming is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curiosity.
Aaronna told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 year old books: all the messages of the economy to the political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
It was working with the capital of March under the age of 16.
(Laughter)
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
I tell her mother that, at some point, she was spinning and an aircraft had two and a half years and passed in the segelone and watched her over the fridge that she had just attacked with her warning.
The calamite.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demands the blogs to synchronize each other, the creators are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
This information is power that we just need to think of a second, we're everywhere, we're in schools, libraries, and universities.
Information, it said from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
Which means creating a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education learning, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this ...
When, as a genius what it is, this comes from its cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker as a hut, not as a hut.
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do whatever you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
That's not the case.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So, if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so, fundamentally, they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
[A.DE.]
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
(Yes)
None.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Hazes.
A great movement for open access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, it is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many, big editors.
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
Then I thought, "What happened?"
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
(Yes)
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
And EFBAI looked at him, a hacker of this genius, probably didn't look at him.
It means that your opportunity to do that Aaron, a CAT.
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
[Yes!]
The aromine is made of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats, and it could do it, but not in this scenario, and they received acts of computer pyramid, up to 35 years old.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first army, anon stood at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, that power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
[Inglese]: But how do you do it?
I think ... (Laughter)
But even now everyone goes through them.
(Laughter)
(Video) Narrator: Watson, how are you doing?
I still had ... (Laughter) I think.
And what about it?
The people have seen a bit of people with a sports system, as they are doing to create the autostrui to carcking sping, in a long term the Sahel.
And with the drill.
Right?
INESDAN is a good sign for a month, it's still a merit, it's an enormous and overwhelmed unit, it's one of the masses, unions of an embedish, of Ander, in Bostile.
[Inglese] Intervistor: Respect the last year I love, that's when I like to be a good age.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass spioning platform is used to spy, to control, to express, and there is also another prospective: Internet, fantastic, liberate, a place of total, freedom of expression; actually, these things are equal to the same way, the Internet is too complex.
to be just one thing.
What can we do?
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
The life's life is not something that will be: if there's one here already, the hell we live in every day, which we form is together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make you sleep and give you spaces.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, well.
Good afternoon everyone, well, in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the mess of the Laboratory of Losalamos and improvedly, it solved the eyes of theattoo and asked where they are all how many.
Well, then, if life had appeared, it didn't have hacked a reason, and he didn't talk about other commensals, and he was thinking about the extraterrestrians, over the years there are hundreds of thousands of estrellas, and so much earlier than on Earth, but the simplest thing is that there is no one outside, that we are all the many.
I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, before or after, in life, I at least do it forever, and I really believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth would be an epocentric change for our species, for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there is no one at the center of the universe, because there is no center in the universe, a seventh in the middle.
Charles Darwin explained to us that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come, we all descend from an antenna unit.
One: and I want to find the scientific evidence of the existence of other worlds inhabitants, I believe it would be a third big paradeable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two.
For this reason, well, in the last years we have probably done many things going on in the directions of a possible answer, not yet we have it, an answer, but we are the first human beings.
And from the penets we know, actually, we know that many of them, we know thousands of planets around other stars, and so we can understand if, in fact, there are, according to some statistical states, we could appear in our galaxy, at least one planet, so we're talking about giant numbers that are one of these planets, that could say, effectively, how our lives are.
We helped, I hope that all of us can be testimonies at the beginning of our lives in the moment of gender, because I repeat, I truly believe that this will be a momental change for all of us, one of the questions that we can make all of us reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare wings, no, because they're incredibly far away from us, they're separated from an ocean of space in space, the universe is truly very big, and now I'll give you a specific example: this probe at a quarantine of years old has arrived at the conferences and has become farther away from the Earth.
It can be put in a sea of green space, and then, according to me, there's one of the things to be present when you try to give more than four years to make an answer to the interrogenative of farms, and then the interrogen in reality that we all have, which is where they are all, and so it is very complicated, maybe we are not alone in the universe.
Let's give an example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand master's hand and the tip of my left hand.
And the past time between the formation of our planet, also ourselves, and these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, the evolution, and only here, the first forms of unicellular life, the antennas, and, in other words, in all life forms may appear here, in the palm of the gray hand.
The dinosaurs appear here at the right of the right hand, there's the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complicated facts of a life of billions of cells, animals, plants, dinosaurs appear here at the end of the dating palm.
(Laughter)
In the beginning of the last speech, a natural catastrophic event, very likely, during this long history of life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet are existant.
So this gives us the idea that this long history, the path of thevolution of life on Earth, was a long, difficult, accident, and governed by ...
They were unbelievable, and that didn't have to carry necessarily to the origin of the most complex organisms, it didn't necessarily have to bring to the origin of intelligence and not that it would have to bring to our comparison to our Homo Sapiens.
Well, I mean, we, in all this, where we are, OK, all the history of humanity ...
It's at the end of an ugly: we could hide the road completely with a Lima's harp.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a little the key of all as if one day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will treat microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence can be very, very incurable, in comparison, without leaving any track in the universe.
Great cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a bit of a kind of warning, maybe we are saying something, life had to overcome...
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine if we're seen from the universe, no one would ever realize that we've been.
But we are a very young species: just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate on radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we reached the entrance of the solar system, but, we ended up putting the footprint in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounds us?
And I think that we'll be here to truly be a peculiar thing: if outside there are super galatical intelligences, as we'll see in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day life on another planet, and we'll be able to face the problems that we see in fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the claim, of these free intelligences is to survive the longest possible, we feel hard, and if we were alone in all this space, well, then I think that even more we have the capacity to keep accessibility until we get this wonderful comfort, parity, for example.
And a small planet lost in the middle of the cosmos, thank you. (Applause)
(Music)
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
KP: Not of the sport that, most likely, has done those who arrived before classifying, but the sport does and generates positivity and positive things for others.
Then, when you think about it, it gives us the strength to move forward and the strength goes well.
You'll believe, believe it.
(Yes)
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 kilometers, which later became 100, I joined two, because Centro Quattro is another issue: no, I don't agree with two, because the six is a number that will come back in more moment, long this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All the participants that instead of running, instead of being worried about coming the first or the last few, came together, after these 166 km agonation.
A beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics that I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet, this I know is an important number.
This is an important number for me.
(Yes)
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 Chileans all of us, we do them during our apartments, but the desert is general, and the crown is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things.
Later on, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a fire, or if it's time, or if it's to do something beautiful, you have to move forward and know how to interact.
There's always the chance to react, and I, the first difficulty I have been to after three Chileans.
(Laughter) And many things seems to me, "Oh, how are you..." I'm a little sunny, I'm raised ..." (Laughter) Okay, you've been surprised, I don't live.
Actually, I couldn't mold, I couldn't mold because in this garage was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga.
An important initiative to help children: an important initiative to take pictures of the fight against Roblastoma, a tumor.
And when it's in the desert it's complex to run from the desert, because there's wisdom, it's a child's tumour that unfortunately unites so many kids, I before this experience I didn't know much about existence, but, unfortunately, there are so many that are still in this moment.
I do calculus.
When it was correct, it was lonely or almost, this was the beginning of the second cover, the certain level of unity we had, but I was always grateful, during the tappe that also began to navigate the seventh of the ground, the heavy, which was in a desert of Namibbe in December, other stages, is considered a gradually.
And we also feel during all of our things.
Even better, during all our work activities of the inhabitable, we feel inhabitable, we feel newspaper.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at some point in the middle of the desert, a night they were going to eat, it was closed.
Keeping from Pummine, there was immense, and in this desert, he was going to take a warning from a backpack, and I don't know if you know that with salary I can eat, and I don't know if you know, but with the sail, I also do medicine, he was happy for the abuse.
The anamibian desert is the desert I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there's the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters away, and when you're here, we've made it of race or almost.
It's strange, you can see it there, on the tip of the flag that was later on the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because in my desert there's no clouds, and when you're at the top, it's an incredible thing: only to save your Chileans.
We are already the Chilean, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and what I did now.
(Music) Sorry, Marganan, Jolf Demy, 4 km/h, the tridouette fature.
(Whispering) It's not something that's going well, I'm happy.
(Laughter) Chiao, quiet, go, and I love him, didn't... (Laughter) Well, thank you all that you're giving you strength.
[Inglese] Buongiorno.
I, in the desert, I found, even when I was also invited this morning, when I talked about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people with me who shared it, other than 26 people, because there was no such a girl with so many defendents, 1996, they were never in TSE, and the last person who had landed with me in the end, the last few kilometers could make a magic, a magic, an incredible magic.
(Audience) Wow!
As you can see, they were all very humble, I also had the share, because the horses were a bit rigid.
And so, this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed the sideline to give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician cabin, you can go back, do the other Chilean to go back, to reach 1006.
(Music) The short term was finished and achieved its goal, on December 20th, 2016, that if you take the figures, they are exactly the numbers that make 16 Chileans, or even 16, 200 dodicies.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
When I had times captured people to think about it, and I was surely 100 meters away.
I wasn't alone... (Applause) (Cheers)
Look: "Haha".
Looking at having a wife that's enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who's already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who already understood that she was six years old, and Pietro, obviously, had already understood the situation, but unfortunately life sometimes.
A bit like the corsa.
What I said before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating episode, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during birth, and it lowered hardly, and this is the last time I saw him smiling.
[The public sends a bathroom]
And...
When I looked ...
When it seemed that everything was going well, on February 18th, 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too tight, OK?
The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
And there... "Hmm."
And of course there isn't.
[A.DE.]
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments.
(Audience) Yes!
You don't have to let go.
(Laughter) (Applause) Keep on, but you have to continue.
Keep going to give you the strength that is destroyed, because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay, and Riccardo continues to move forward in life, and you never get to January and San Pietro's 29th.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, so I had to do what to manage to create or improve my life, improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people the strength.
I ended up arriving in Namibia desert, where these 16 kilometers have brought me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you see there the perfection, which I wanted to take 21200 euros.
And I'll continue to run by myself, which is 222, because I haven't only run from the desert.
And this year in November went to the desert of Omanna and Chileans will be 165 so I got only water, we came here, we waited to get to the end, but the desert is diverse, but the opposite is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them do better, the message so they can do it today is an important message.
Anything is the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always hoping for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
[A.DE.]
(Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much.
And today, are we here?
And today is 176.
From 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everything.
