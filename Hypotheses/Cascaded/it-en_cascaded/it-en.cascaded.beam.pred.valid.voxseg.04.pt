In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Forum Fortiching Learning, which was supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born rationally.
Before, the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create environments of less formal data, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
He usually enters the classroom.
The first ten minutes, when the students come and are, focused on the ego of my computer speaker and put in classical music: I think this is the first step to create environments of less rational and find the attention of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on the spot of everyone already: artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories I tell about in children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
Second World War.
It's in 1942.
The Unite painting.
Slothes and parts.
A residence northern Londra.
And there was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a special and enigma machine.
And it was a machine to write.
The operator digitalized tastes, but, older than stamping on a paper, those letters, are stamped out other letters, according to a code imposed on functionally under the hand.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper had in front of you a text without meaning.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main characters in Blece Park, with his team and built them one morning.
With which you can see, behind, in order to decipher these scissors written by youredes.
For this invention you think that the war is over with two years old, saving many human beings.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to make her logical richer.
It is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
So, with his Turing's machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about the mental magazine.
computer and machine learning.
But where does your test suggest?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be a P?
The chief on the computer, who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a operator or a operator.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
It is said that the vehicle starts to overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers came from the vehicle and when the answers came from the operator: this is a game limiting.
Behind, the vehicle must have special characteristics to overcome the test.
Behind, it must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
And you must argument in an automatic way to form these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence, one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts at the moment they get, or we try to modify our thoughts at a psychological level.
That's why it says that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues, according to this approach, the assignment that if we can have a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
But probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates and mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
It's about building deductive arts and transferred into a veritable conclusion, from here the deductive logic is born, according to the development of the rules of the thought, from here the productiontive logic is born.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
An rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) You must act.
But they must adapt to the answer.
You have to set goals and know how to bring them to the end, and you must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote, can a machine think, we can say we can create a machine.
A artificial agent, capable of thinking, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
What about this?
It's about building intelligent and supported artificial integrity of man, it's a cycle.
But do we see today?
Well, if machines can think.
I would like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence, and I would like to use five classics to classify artificial intelligence agents according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
Human beings, human beings, and there are the optimal agents, I want to share with some examples: optimal agents are the agents that make better than all men, and it can't be better, for example agents that solve the Rubik cube, with a fourth in the best way, already with a sad one, think that in 4.73 seconds.
But do we have Sovans' agents?
That works better than all people, for example, in the game of the scenarios, in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the green aircraft, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who act almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game.
But will you answer the question of the kicking?
We looked at the "min".
What do they do?
Almost like all people, for example in cognitive activities such as those believed or the imagination classifications.
Finally, we have subtle people who work on the stage of all people, examples are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today don't know how to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge like...
The candle, or are we talking about the juice of Apple bodyrea?
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest, the majority of artificial intelligence limitations, in which we think we're far from overcoming the avenue.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
In America this concept was introduced by the name of technological monolarity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest aspects of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with an exponential call: this settlement keeps coming.
The measurement predicted in the wall legislation, in which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, two years ago and in quadruplication every four years.
The second Rekruzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to use this computerlessity to emulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
Before, in 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computer abilities.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we could already be able to operate in a precise way our brain, and finally in 2029.
And the machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045, and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
According to mind rivers, Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against her same test, these observations are our observations against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
He was a student at the University of Varese.
I was the only one who proposed a definition against the tune test, against artificial intelligence, followed a history of epistimology, deontology and ethics of mathematics, given by professor Gaitano in his ear Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to trust was proposed a decent observation formulated with a mathematical treatment.
The toney is stupidity.
Afterwards, I want to describe it in simple ends, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put it in a seed, symbol of a sound on the side of the equation.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine, so we get an intelligence desigualdad, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it is also true that we left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story.
Relaxing ourselves to the first question: Can machines think?
I'd like to share with you an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I call the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his own phone, which doesn't make me a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me immersed in my maps, to take care of a liquid matter, the technological consciousness that exists in the production of a scenario, part of a new language, in the way it influences is the theory of view and the forms of complication; these are many others, in which way mobile photographs change their contemporary so that they change the processes through which we communicate.
With professionals, in fact, that for the first of ten years already opened the challenge of this new medium, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the experts of their experiments sharing images through the cellulare.
To find answers around me, and I arrived to New York, the DESC of the New York Times Magazzi photographer, in Cathiran, Parigi, in the sale of Parifoto, one of the most prestigious photography chairs in the world, to enter those places where photography is distributed and put in contact and understand how mobile photographs change these ingranages.
(Laughter) In order to find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the biggest places that are visited in contemporary countries.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to simply belong to a global narcissistic disorder, like some sociologists have written with the basis of occupational systems of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as a schedule, as an identitarian ostectation, as a sovere various appropriation of its imagination.
And the "Holéa Schlamager."
The thermal ending that has embedded and still segmented our vision of the mobile, this is my channel, Zazzi, who is the victim of my photographic experiences, is simply the result of a world's epidemic of a pleasurable, or, instead, as it has sustained social and storical, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, and from this phenomenon I tried to give an interpretation in a book called "I Revolution," put together for a story of mobile photographs, because besides the flow of images that put people into communication from an angle to the other side of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective gathering, if you want, that has impressive numbers, every two minutes today we can take more images of how many years of human beings have scaven in the interaction of this century.
Out of the 150 million of these images are shown every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram: production and diffusion of images, of activity which, until a few years ago, was a series of professionals, became an event of public dictionary in which we define through the images we produce, or better.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that was strongly remarked about the process of liquid that connects them daily, the fluid of photography mobiles, seems the most natural expressive form, a liquid vision that is composed of complaints constantly based simply on the external gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone call that the object stays the professional photographer and that difference passes between Western photos and conscious photos.
CR: On one hand, the ease to use the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals, the universal language, leading to understanding that process of democratization of photography, began with the Ecodak and arrived up to the iPhone.
But on the other hand, try to think that the possibility of interaction is direct through the photography of a dialogue, with a potentially global opportunity, like SICAIRO, which has dedicated this tool with a photographic and social shelf, like these female photographs of those, with a majority of a universal world, the invention that has had been the economical people, in real time, between the euphraphy, which is always in a photographer, shown, and the opraphy, and followed, as a result, followed, followed, and followed, with a new job, followed, and followed,
Orona VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deep-founding, photograpically, Cuban that belongs to a simple smartphone has explored new paths for my study.
Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sports photography, scriptive territory, photographic territory, an irreperformant look, which has resulted as a report policy, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a Community of attempts to return to his work.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
Going through the Everest African stadium, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African Africa, beyond media stereotypes, of the Western matrix on the crisis and the fame, showed how mobile phones.
How do Luis have reinterpreted the Homero's Odyssey with cellulare, sharing in the AI series, I know one of the oldest heritage of the West's history with the most new vision tool, or how they've been in balance, logical and digital trade, far past and contemporary stream, well, what do these photos we don't know how to do?
To keep on walking down the outskirts of action, creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and suggetto, to creatively contaminate the code of storytelling, to draw on the surface of the background that gives us the eyes, and to filter, and the quality, which is still a powerful cultural metaphor, thanks to everything.
And do you feel it?
You feel this.
What we believe is to be silence.
But in reality?
And there are 50 electric wheelchairs.
50 thirds that have entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist.
So also in this room, those sectors, these seeds, and turn a frequency of 50 euros.
And then you imagine, isn't you?
I went home after a really stressed job magazine.
Picture him, your partner, with your partner, and then you'll get to bed on your bedroom and think of being on your own, and instead not.
And there's always the law, this frequency of 50 airplanes.
That I simply increased volume because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less this sound.
We have a positive side.
Well, or better, I start from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive side.
And we are never alone.
Which is always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Great, paranoid.
What if we keep it like a drawing?
This frequency of 50/30th isn't different than a sound round, a sounding circle with a beautiful richer space, with which you can make music, and then I was overwhelmed.
But why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Anchor.
I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a little bit more, why?
Then, my life began, deciding to make music exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
But they divorced when I was a child.
F: Well.
I know it, you may think that this is the classic 'backyard' history, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
At the solitude of those days, at the air crash, at that house, I started to make music with all that surrounding you.
So?
Every barefoot complements weren't anymore.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But this is my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, was not hanging on her buttons, on the other mother, "Ciao, I'm staying in the streaming," and that's it.
I say, at some point,
I started to become a normal person, trying to say, "Go ahead, I started studying channel, pianoforte."
And then I liked Woody Allen, so I started smiling the Clarinetto, the problem Arenzo Arbore really liked, who wrote a personally ambiguous song, was bringing it all the first years of studio in genius.
I also gave up the clarity.
Just like this, to not go.
My failures, my classmates.
But I dropped all this, because I studied and studied that rigorous notion, because there is more harmony in a rumor?
Because there's more spontaneous sounds in a way, and I like to disagree with the problems of life.
All of us have attached a rumor, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow in much more.
With a smile, here's my mission.
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
I'd love poetry, saying.
I had a great turn of dollar, kidneys, and everything would be conclusive, but no, I had a hard time in this way my life.
What's the sound?
But most of all?
That's the study, it's collected, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful, to bring a closer together: our internal eye, the catalogue of the systems, our tax, reaches the massive functional, around the fifth week of gestation.
Because feet must be ready to what speterns in life, once born, must be ready to the dark texture, that means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before watching, and that doesn't have to fear.
It must be ready, so not in case if mom, during pregnancy, listened to Pancroco Britannic, there's no need to be stupid if the child, once he is born, will sleep to listen, for example, to Shakespeare.
So, the future and mum, I'm saying, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else.
But what's the sound?
Well!
And the sound is that ...
It's not all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what happens in our lives is completely astronomy: you can't see it, you can't touch it, but it's the sound column every day, the doctor in our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals, because the visibility is much easier, we know it.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
But more small than that: there is a smallest of the Militarian man, the smallest of San Pietro, the smallest of your house, maybe?
And it captivates the same thing, as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I met many people, and he told me, "But I imagined high, well, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible."
So?
From this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's dream of imagining our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe, then we're in vaccine.
If it's not the case, let's take a picture of the feet, in the wisdom, then the election, Chileans don't exist, I lost my story, but it's a multicannel, a lot of senses, but many, many, many, many people who were here.
(Laughter)
But nobody loses the damage.
We photograph it.
And we keep it, we make a lot of video, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence that silence that between the other doesn't exist: there are two, listening, closing and listening.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, hooing it.
It's your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you the dream of my life, the dream of my life, the dream of my life, that was born from the opposite of myself, for the first time the harvest of myself, which then turned into harmony, and I sponsored to find a far away place from the place, here, I decided to choose a city on Atlant.
And the whole part, really, from the side of the cities, the cities are a great musical instrument, in order to welcome this musical instrument, decided to participate in a competition, they came into an artistic residence, the most beautiful years of my life, in a simple fact, that for the first time I was listening to the sounds of all the world, of all the cities.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where for 48 hours I didn't stop recording the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a sound column, so in this moment ...
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
[A.DE.]
Hail!
I've bought the baby monkey!
In Ivo Mantaña, in Ivo Manque, who voted for sphere here ... (Yes)
[The public sends a lower!]
We say to be young, my brother.
I feel good, I feel good.
(Pierre Jean-Pierre Bacri) (nglese) ( Anglese) ( Anglese) (Anglese) (Anglese) (Anglese) (Anglese): Dive a bathtub.
(Music) (English) Intervistor: What's time?
Difference.
Tchipadiani?
Okay?
Twain?
Perfect!
(Applause) You were still focused on the visibility.
And this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test.
Wrong them all exposed to the visitor.
Now, there's a city that is certain, you've been photographed all the way, and you're more than one time, but at that summer, it's in the tombs, it's coming, but the bridge of Brooklyn can resonate.
Yes, the bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that defines everything in its leg.
And what about the desire to join them?
Thank you.
I believe Al Counter that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
But it's not magical because it was another part: it's magical because it's under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
Well, in this picture...
And the drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
And without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captained so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
Good afternoon.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sons gave me the data of these children, that in this iron pipe, portable, have given me this helpful camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Let's go to the span of ...
Great.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a part that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency, which has become a synthesis.
MM: OK, Geneva is Mordandis.
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a fight, that's a serious thing.
Every time.
Because the writer, which you can see as easily in the Ferrari desk, is not just a writer, for me is a great musical instrument, and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony, and it's more or less like this.
Well, the last one, after I really wanted to talk about Genova, is that of all the bars of the pork.
That we are exposed to look beyond, but the sound of a ghetto that gave me particularly a frequency that became the melody, and so I created this microphone immersed for 48 hours in the port of Genova, and I found a sound of a perceive that transformed into what is the voice provided by the son's colony.
How many are they?
It's true, beautiful, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Okay.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
That's the sound of our passions in my and in your lives, and for how many people will tell you they're rumors, they're out of time, they really want to listen to them, and I'll give you back to school, thank you!
As Guy Beck said in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the DNA of the idea, in general, the idea of the Ristitution linked to the monetary Ristitution to the benefit.
AC: Many times, instead, the restitution is connected to restiting what you did, what you learned.
And from the part of those who say, "We don't do anything," then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post of 18 minutes shared some of this story.
(Laughter) By the end of the 90s I actually thought that this is my son's therapy, it came up next to sewing, and in the same year, my female therapist organized the recipe to pay the asylum's school, it was an activity.
Very heavy, with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the common state," but most of them were these extraordinary reports.
But to help astronomy, to help the community.
But one million of 200,000 readings has taken back, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro then.
And it was one of the strengths of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we went to the United States, this time is similar to the same school as a school in the neighbourhood. This is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explained that it's a totally ordinary reality, that is the thing of 'giveback' of the restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole society: I said this to the restitution, I've had a fortune, I am still in school, I enjoy university, along with museum, theaters, there are all the communities that can afford to restitution of volunteers, not that society is based on that.
And I've been working for ten years, some of you might have met him, that's the moment to talk about the famous Obamaker.
The seat says, "Desistemis Dion is now."
We are already expecting, very actively, to ask ourselves, "System is one of the moment."
A famous baking lotter Obama was an incredible technological debt.
They build a study that does not work, so many millions of contents, and this is the standard answer they got, soon, critical is not finishing for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal, after trying to do, and helping, which is extraordinary, technological experience, for us, is not a common thing.
This is the Time Magazine's copertine, which encourages the technological technologies that have been sent by Google and other companies, there are fert, and agree with the white house, they have high schools, markets, has put in the section of the site, in just a few cities, to one decim of the costs.
And probably many of us would have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
And the extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, since I finished the TAMEG discovery without being very interesting, is what I want to explain to you about what was spilled, I spilled by people who have also learned their lives, the experiences that had recovered.
In this case?
But they keep the ability to manage great, technological systems, complex processes, flexible, and reproduceible.
And making them again reproduce and irreplaceable, and creating a replicable system that is the IURS of Torris, from this effort has been born.
But a replicable system is what we expect to do as well.
But I want to suffer with the word models, because we also impose the models, the ones that have taught perseverance, the desire to never make any mood, to continue to insist, energy, empathy, so these are the models that are part of this bag, that we must, and use, we want to rest.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we've said until now, but also Italy, almost all the years traveling around the world, the idea of going back to help was even because they're Italian.
I wanted to do it, "Duordonald's not three."
Being or not doing, there is no attempt, maybe theusse in Italian is doing or not doing, there's no point only to criticize.
Things later, we're five to meet Matteorencia San Francisco, and he came in my business in the Silicon Valley, high levels of sensitive need for transformation in general, things that have enabled us to a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of the public recording.
[A.DE.]
She asked me, "Why don't you think about helping employment for an year's youth, I think, I reflected the packaging with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my gay boss to make it brief, I decided to apply a methodology of choice, and I couldn't do it, or I try to not even find it?"
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years, in the Amazon roof.
But those who do it as an Amazon, a robot, you know how to kill, but those things underwater, there are only many slums, I must say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
But I was mentally convinced about chooticism and bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But did you wish this disguise, and I didn't expect it, obviously?"
But authenticism isn't often about sexism, that makes you feel a certain mentality, you never change it, obviously you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind, and in this country there is a lot of common sense.
It's about doing things because you think of helping, improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people, recognize it, like Ministry Megrey.
But I say this because my book, my films, and then, immediately, from the beginning, of extraordinary commissions, is simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume some people on the foots of public recording.
The only thing I asked you is, since the systems from the inside don't transform themselves, we want to try to transform them with people that are outside, where the fact that we don't know public administration is a sign, not a bathtub, it's an advantage and not an advantage.
(Laughter) So, funding, we created a small team, 25 people said, a not big world, not too small, of technological expectations, around 80 percent expected to make giants, legals, governors, and communication.
Here you see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't scratch what I think will happen, in this way we can see such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
Time also has a compost, and it's probably much better than what you see, and I'm convinced, so I came up with the idea: but how can I invite someone to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, the closed photograph of Bella, that in 19947 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone kids, in all the United States, in this massic sport, regarding investments and infrastructures?
We've created the vision that the country's operative system, a series of fundamental components that can be built more efficient practices for citizens, public management and companies, through innovative digital products, a very beautiful vision of documentation, is fencing and blood.
And I've continued in my place: field of businesswater, older than the American future, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of you will say, don't know how public record works, we've already proved in many, in Italy it doesn't work.
And continue?
But we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be kinds and prejudices, the critics of the first kind will be rid of people who really want to offer sponsorships to their contribution and we treat them a lot.
The second guy, the people who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the bicycle as a fence.
Or that's the simplest part of the impointment, and that's our problem.
To recognize things that don't work.
You remember this picture, the first time, men and women in the hall of Time Magazin.
Here's the thing here, so, although he tried to memorize the most possible agent among the chlists, I got around 3,000 questions, of course, at least a hundreds of them decided to qualify, we used digital networks for chlists, an app that's called Jazz, we put it in Jazzle, we put it in Jazzle, on the technological side, and now we're a bit of sellings, and now we're a bit of vents, and we've immediately experienced operating, what do we do?
But in fact, we are in the same way.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should be interconnected, it's silos that they don't know.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their suffering and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
And it spends the survey of the public administration public, sci-fi scores of software, of course, and to do so many open procedure activities, therefore so much idraulic activities.
But we can't even smaller.
To make the tasks of the sink, in time, you have to make them improve authentic interface, making more simple things.
Well, all these things are done in parallel, but without you, you can't do the right.
After a few months, at the July of 2017 we wrote, "The Spanish piano, the recording public, we did together," and to explain that there's one thing, exists.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole has stigmatized the decrease of the present that it is minister, the digital dissonation is a state priority, the trendial piano.
But it requires a team game to simplify public recording, the life of citizens, particularly the piano.
It's been newspaper once in the year, because the kids can't be created, there are mostly technologies, and it's appreciated to records, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management.
It's recent, the recovery of the technological rules and allows most likely to three warning wages and connecting to other norms in other norms, and at some point there are quite uncomfortable technological rules: unfortunately we can't talk to the administrators themselves, the technological skills of what they understand.
To improve it.
Instead of thinking in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano to competitive platforms, these are competitive platforms, the digital payments, are those things that abilitate in horizontal all the public recording activities: the more they will be electronic, electronic, electronic cards, an informable fire.
And the best project that we followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population: "Oh!
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I have to become a citizen of an island, motorization, all those posts, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're already solving this technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
But two weeks ago we made a Seria Akaton.
It was done in 25 Italian cities, without San Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from the technological point of view, like from the state.
All of this concluded that we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the beautiful space of art spunts, like the T, where they're wired, all documentary, in all the codes, but always more, of applications.
It's Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
But I was also working on other projects that can't be limited in an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it's true that kids are composed, let me disappoint you, this might be, for example, one of those things briefly, to grow in an alsa, alpha, or a digital citizenship, the phone, the smartphone, the digital identity, the data of the public recording, with a little bit of: we're dreaming a little more, because work we do so much, but it's due to this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years they wrote an uncertainty the world that we expect, I asked many people to talk about what they think could happen, I asked me to talk about basic simplification of life of every day of citizens, I hide the occasion to write an article that I want to cite some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
A country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, to cliché building it.
A country with high technological competitions that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public administration is an wealth: where the best humans do better to work in public research centers, that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation.
What do they bring development to the country?
Now I'm a dream.
And that the components to do all this digital process policies, technological processes are really many and maybe too many, but if they don't have a dream about which hardly they can do things.
To conclude, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
It has been used for some part in this theater among others, to this point, but it's easier, and not if you've managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Digital Transformation, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our brain is our social system.
And what if I had the chance to make a wish?
One only to change a aspect of your life that won't come.
Then, what will you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're scared, they're keeping you, it's for that, because here's what's behind you.
Then, raise your hand those who would change something about your body, maybe lose some thread, or maybe win your muscles.
AC: Oh, well, here's a bit more, there's more freedom.
Then raise your hand if you'd change the corriente, better if you want.
I was sure everyone would be over there.
But maybe you are one of those who will change peace.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question: let's try not to change each other, and the answer was different because the elementary school would have a more united family, but my parents don't separate.
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
Liceo would have felt the most complex professors, it seemed to me all eyebrows and I was reflected in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Before the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I started fighting and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't move me well, what others thought of me on the biggest economical feasts, of the interpersonal relationships with characteristics that I acquired from birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I carried out my research also to other people, and I realized that them, like me, used mainly three strategies: these strategies were used in small dose, could also bring some benefits, but, as most of the cases were the only three drawings of playing in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a good thing but end up keeping their problem in life.
The strategy, today, the broader, is to get lamented.
And we're lamenting a little bit of it.
Because there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, fasting, that I've done differently, we're sorry because there's no injustice, with many people who are stuck in the mind's clock, and the problem is that if they concede mental space, this paralyzes you, throw away, and get to buy even today.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything that was to get bothered, from when I started talking, when I stopped to return home, she had started the love of a young boy, who laughed, and then of the boyship with whom he had translated it.
So from the fact that he didn't have a job, the last national ship that didn't help him, felt worthwhile, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized all his daily life, because with a small effort you could obtain a great result.
Realize the victim's role, which is listened, comforted, helped.
But beware, you can lift at night, at night, at night, at night, at friends.
In high voice or in your mind, you can lie to yourself, or as much more often happens, you can lie to yourself to the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you are forced to memorize hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what is harming you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, it's that of lamenting, let's press that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair from the back to the magnifying glass.
Another verytoned strategy, when things are stretching, is that of imporciation, it requires our necessity.
(Laughter) In the basis of this mentality there is a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't okay is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being, what surrounds us, doesn't you like bearing?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
You felt a bit dirty, but why can we never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it?
Your wife breaks you, divorce!
Even fresh, let's take a look at how many risks it is: your child doesn't listen to you, I don't count.
(Laughter) And too big, we couldn't lead him to the psychologist. We are here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, I chose him for this, this profession, to make the world around you get involved in the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships ofppies.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I do nothing else, that listening to what, according to someone else, would have to change to ease the waves of their future.
Your left.
Well, it's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in the kinds, and then it's a classicone, and it's not, you know you don't realize all the things I do for you, and it's not, you don't realize all the things I do for you, that always starts with the same word, streamed, you.
And because we need to show all the line of equity of others, we need to make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing we say it often in good feet, believing deeply.
Think about a couple of times, because it's hardly possible to change something, elderly, instead of giving up on the basis of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, in order to apply them, if the strategy that privileges, when things are not going like wearing, it's that of imported your need and waiting.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there are no tools, like a tool, take the forehead, put it underwear.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of altruistic needs.
I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, whose end of the first childhood had learned to district with great degree between the kids of mum and dads.
I hope to spell on the moon that as soon as I was confronted with those who would have lost the love of others, in this limited situation.
There are important things that I learned, for example.
To listen to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no to the things that didn't happen to them, he didn't learn to say no to the things that didn't happen to them, and the need to count how many.
If the strategy that privileges, when things are not as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, I will finish to disrupt them.
To regret this, it requires your needs or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in a long time, in my life, abused.
I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school for which I was working on sent me to call and said, "But Zuccelli, here, for her, there's no place.
If you like to continue collapse with us, you must accept a disorder.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most, or if everything had to go there to do a job that neither there was a big deal with all that I had studied until then.
Then I got to know how to die, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never have to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
And there I learned that to obtain different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
And change yourself.
What if I had changed?
But the others would also have to follow, change, change.
If I turned into a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, the primary school would not send me anyway.
And if I had done that, the thing wouldn't harm me more than that, but perhaps I would have gone away before even imitating it, but if I wasn't that person yet.
But the answer wasn't in the hill of others, but I had to ask my responsibility profound.
Why are things?
Behind, it doesn't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
But choosing the places as a cause of things that don't go as a path.
Keep in yourself as a cause of things that don't go as far as you are.
This is our bifth.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
Now I'll be there alone, and guilty, to confront something much bigger, I want to say, it's the crisis's side, what do you want to do?
(Laughter) But if instead of you, you think of being perfect, that maybe there's a marginal of change, that then improved, then you open your doors in front of you, because you defend your responsibility, you can always decide to learn a new language, to read books, to acquire new skills, or to consolidate those you've already had, you can work on you to become a journal.
Because life is from those who do it, who don't do it up?
If inside the coppy, things don't go well, you think it's the other side to where to take the first step.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question: What can I do today differently to make your best magazine?
And in this way that I created a mental space, I used to go to the research of his needs, then things change, and in this way that I create a mental space, I first went to the research of his needs, and then I tried to operate to satisfy them, now on the research of his needs, and then to make the war.
I don't know one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, prostitute and relaxation.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do, if you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become a role model of the game.
And starting to work on myself, considering the cause of the things that didn't walk like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to invest in being a better person, when I was writing to university I had a dream, the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my material there were practical, concrete tools, and also fast, to bring great value inside their lives, but, but, however, a couple of problems?
Stereots, prejudices, psychologists are the doctor of the mates, psychologists are the doctor of the debts, but they had to talk to a friend, but they go to the barbecue, but what should I do?
I had to get lamented or maybe not to explain how many good psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to give up my dream: No, I had to learn to speak a language, which was not happening, but near the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs, instead of being mine.
Little time following this instruction?
I achieved the results for me inimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights.
I thought about it, and in the end I decided I would have accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
Behind, I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I cartooned on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the crack, I'm talking about collecting ants, because maybe they think...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the reason of video psychology, thanks to this thing, every day thousands of people get closer to psychology, putting in discussion some of the stereotypes that the first one has accumulated: dreams.
And then they don't become real because, fortunately, why did you get that chance?
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps you hold and makes you move forward, those who don't know how to build and need to discuss.
Because the topic should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your bones of always, here.
If there's something I've learned from all this journey that helps me.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must warn to our internal: ten motivations had asked a question.
If I have the chance to express a desire, only one thing to change a aspect of your life, that doesn't come as mixed up, that would change, we talked about the work, the physical aspect, the current narrative.
Well, in childhood, I'd like to share with you with a gift, which is, at least, prove to you, is a small question that I personally was very useful.
And that's based on the logic that, in order to generate big changes, you have to focus on so many small actions.
What's the simplest thing?
What will you do until now, at the end of the store, tell you in case after this beautiful newspaper and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the directing here to collapse.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions that are both?
CV: Have you liked the frugone to what you eat.
[Inglese] O fever left pulm, wet but where I put the packs, "Fedemma, martians are the providers."
FdB: I've made my hands, today, my hair.
Or on her feet that it's now to change.
(Video) Offiti is when I arrived to my mother.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And me ...
Well, this time I want to take this by myself, here.
But I had a dream.
to create a group of integration, of diversity and various abilities.
The percussions are so fast, so immediately, they take up the distances and join the battles.
We are partners.
We are part of the sets.
Seven kids I see them, eye, Laura, Paola, Niele, I saw them growing, our provides were marriage, the marriage was the day of providing, where they entered this room in the school of Andreoli.
They were picking up the first bidonies, he was together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become a group marathon, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical sights and we saw the first ones, the first weddings in the butterflies.
And the first satisfaction, the first encounters?
The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012 the beloved world came across.
It's in the real sense of the word.
Tutts of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake we filled our land, and from that moment on, we were the thousands of earthquakes.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were no more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
But where all marriages were found was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
The endless voter, the erlopi.
We've done it.
Luckily, we found everything.
We are all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of thousands and thousands.
Within that tennis, magnificent things happened.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
She looked at us in the eyes, with the Earth she washed, to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
And the surname of sci-fi?
I have become the advertising categories.
These are the tubes that have become?
You use the tools built and combined with ping pong roots, to take the bills with markets, shoot.
We were in a continuous job, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already inside is born our first spettacol, we decided to put a true spettacol.
So both the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say that we were, we turned into 25, 30, 40, 50.
We began with the construction of the first spettacol: white man, because there were smaller lights, the larger lights and the white man, at that moment, we all moved together as a white lighter.
After that, we did ...
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also have a moment from our land.
It's to breathe for a moment.
After the year, we made cracks, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this stone, and none of us would have ever thought that a stone could change our lives.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 impacts in return to the state.
The stage of the first master?
GV: The concerts on the TV program at a friend's house.
Is it the kindergarten stage?
[A.DE.]
And we really did a lot.
And also to me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly me.
It's exactly the circumstances of life, that of fatigue, of sudden, but also of freshness.
It's a problem that has so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
Why is there still so much?
It's the one to build.
Thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until I realized what has happened in the last 250 years: there are 250 years very important that have changed our history radically, and that we live today.
We talk about social innovation, and my question is: Is there this social innovation, and especially our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be treated around innovation?
This is the stage of digital photographs: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, and I believe so everyone.
In fact, it adds a technological evolution that was precisely attracted to these 250 years, it's the phone, the phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
However, these three factors together, joining mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, somehow, strictly battled arbitrally in the 2000s, that we are living today.
We've tried to understand, then, what has happened in these 250 years, that revealed the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the void on the Internet, the revolution we call it an iron, which is what we have studied.
And the vaporean motor is not only a vapore mask, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored, and it resembles much faster, the estation of carbon dioxide, and the rising can at an ever lower cost because we need the vapor motorcycle.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
In the vapore, we also need the motorbike, the motorbike, because, by the way, it's a Toscanan invention and an Italian invention.
With scoppy motorcycle, we must, for example, the automotic industry. Actually, it was used for the naval industry, because motorcycle was a motorbike that couldn't, from farmer, when I was able to understand how to get out of the script to hold it as well as wood and coming along with the seeding that developed the automobility company, and all that which was produced, but not only.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still businesses, for example, for the phone, the phone isn't only with the tool that permits us.
To keep reviewing our letters and that has rapidly modified the migration of these letters from one part to another of the world as much as I knew.
But it's also what permits us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because after the screen we couldn't try it on the sea, and then what we had to interrupt everything: no, we were moving forward, making caves under the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storic dimension, was taken from artists between Mexico and artists of the abbia, not just two populations who agree with it, but the first cave went there.
And we're around 1858.
Behind, there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, continental energy in Europe, was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
It's part of our history, it's swimming from others.
But let's move forward, we tried to make rooms that are still throughout history, but that's already experienced important features and even important emotions from the point of cultural disartistic, but we started to lose something, to compose something that had never been in the history before, between the pictures that in the beginning of the 50's, and they had simply fasted the calculation, they are the computer, they are of calculators, they are of sidewalks, but in these 50 years of the intelligence Revolution, and they simply had a quick link.
There were research teams, and above all, there were planes of tables and defense that led us to develop landmares, but they didn't know where to take them all over the land, but endless, because they weren't known.
At some point, he decided to open these responses.
And these responses, called ARPA, ARPANET network, became and started to be the World Web that we know.
It's a broadcast, orchontal system, non-archical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, to collect information, in 1995, there were 25 million, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of tens of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to copy data, to collect data or to develop data.
When the functional strength, which was replaced by the concept of industrial revolution, began to disrupt artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
What is called to give the Internet, and this according to a phenomenon of " disruption" of creative destruction and the Internet we had the epoch that, if little by little, we started to live the horizon we've lived right now, that we're progressively distruging what's old, because it's new, it causes a reflection.
I've tried to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, from the scale, I still haven't done the Italians yet.
The Minister Minghetti, provided Mingetti's license, established that the 27th century of the doctor, is free, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing ministers, I'm introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their surroundings.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land, and especially.
It has transformed the economic power of the power of producing goods and goods in the power of producing a good, the dense.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also the industrial system that allows us to keep in a massive way, a structured way, in a healthy way, in a quantity of food.
So, there's another chance, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of everyday life.
And this is the man who begins to live at the end of the November, these are us.
During the time, as we said, computers arrived and the Internet arrived, but 25 years ago we didn't have speeds as we are today, and also the speed of the rings, the speed of our movement, and we quickly moved the speed, the speed of our thinking that it's not the detail of the thought, but we are very fast.
And until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2000, when we can say it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that significantly indicate the passing of one another, 2001 and 2001.
First of all.
And the American economy started to slow down, the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in the balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
But there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was already overwhelming, they don't talk about it, but still there.
It changed something, but I changed it, it changed the economical paradigm, we couldn't.
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis, which was effectively verified in 2008; it was crazy, we didn't think, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would happen: we were certain, and we didn't know how to wait, look at these images.
These companies are credible multinationals in most of them, but above all, they are all the companies that have been since 2011.
What did those companies do, they didn't innovate in inventing something, they didn't innovate in building something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done to buy and sell to travel, learn?
It's about it.
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
And the adventure, the idea that often is considered, is so much and little, not yet something, according to human abilities, human resources, ability to heal it, to be different from abilities based, the abilities based on what allows us to develop.
A third future that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it, a third, a fourth element, is the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So the trade, the industrialization of products and services, the digitalization sign.
The use of the Internet, frankly, is enough to look at the newspapers and see that we are growing fast, there are new connections between new operators, new competitions, which are building a thesis and competitive competition very important, there are all five elements that are growing up, and at a speed of growth completely athetic until two years ago, so we are really seconds.
Actually, a very profound change has been brought to the biggest multinationals, and there are competences and digital inclusion in Brazilian factors, and in this way we have to pay a lot of attention, not significant to large internationals, in fact.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures, they know how to do something extraordinary: "Made in Italy," they have a quality or eccellence in the production of products.
It's quite united in their position, we all want it.
But the only thing we have to do is to acquire insistently competences inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve.
An interaction of the market in an extraordinary way, creating ricks for all the people around us: a human nature, nature, for its nature, for its existential nature, thanks to an analytical heritage, and this is the first assa that we have, the first great motorbike which is the adventure, and its cultural heritage.
But it's possible that tourists only visit three cities, Venezuela, Roman America and then distribute, but the ricks of these three cities don't make the richest of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've started, but we're speed to recover, to include this patrimony within a knowledge system that allows us to take it and to sport it to make it note, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all of our country, I believe that this is your great pill that we can do to our Italy, greater.
Fitter has drowned me.
I talked to him in a certain sense, and the opposite of the word that identifies all this inconfort is the opposite of the word "share," because I'm going to talk about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
With a question: According to you, in the last 15 or 20 years, to celebrate it, we say in the 21st century: inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens have increased or are diminished?
But I believe the majority of you would answer: they increased, if they were taken from journalists, maybe they would add the premature action, they increased exponentially, and if I asked you, "My and in Italy?"
But maybe the answer of many would also be.
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the video sources, I have prepared with my colleagues a report.
We know about inequality, from when they are data, that is, officially, from 1960 to the highest in the world's countries.
And the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
And from the end of the 20th century, at the end of the 90s, the aggressive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipited now we are at the storic mining and in Italy.
In Italy, the victims of inequality are quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
CR: We have a trend of inequality in decrescent.
And how can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is to say: we've put a complete alcohol in order to keep talking about years of increase in inequality in how data can't support our feelings, and there's certainly in this letting.
But we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are ourselves?
Let's change.
(Laughter) The feeling wasn't wrong, but maybe the idea of inequality in which we think is wrong.
[A.DE.]
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality about what we want to say about inequality, perhaps the thing of inequality is filled with some reproduction, and we move around a century.
And we also moved to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
It was a seventh, the company of a worker, the first says: "In that occasion it will be 8 times the one of today, in 1928.
And this exchange, indeed, is realised, because if you're about to engage.
There are the richest remains of the economy.
Effectively, in most of the society, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years that, even 10 or 12 times, so this profile has been carried out, but from this professor Keynes also found an opportunity, an idea, that is, humanity.
The free time, that would have gone with a huge amount of things in the middle, that is where it can be said, little to 100 years working less and she also said to her, to work all of them, and when she told her about it, she wanted much less, she wanted a week of 15 hours of work.
Behind, I have three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
G.G: Well.
Apparently, your second trust didn't become true, because we see it all that we don't work and it doesn't seem exactly that we work three hours a day.
I'm going to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're convinced that it's not done anywhere, we'll see those succession in Italy.
This one is...
Kurve, this trajectory represents.
But the fraction of time?
That an Italian means a lot of work throughout his life, his life naturally work hard, meaning during 15 years, when we are able to do a job, well, if we look at this crack, Keynesi's teacher was realised, why, at the beginning of 90 percent of our lives?
Then, to work and now we call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
I have two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Well, naturally.
If this has happened, there are reasons that are often studied, studied long, for example, elderly aligned, because we die a lot after life expectancy, and who has grown up in something like 27 years, from the start of 25 to 30 years, so young age is aligned.
Yes, but there is a reason, maybe, more fundamental, for that.
CR: Our time quote?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see, OK?
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
AC: Today.
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income, are more than workers.
FdB: Is the frontier of this?
Farming action: we can also have a reaction.
It's enthusiastic, meaning.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation in Italy.
And it was united.
GV: This is the storic series of time.
According to the work in life, as you can see, in the United States only goes to the '30s, it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while we believe it, but even more impressive, and the storage amount of the occupation rate, as we can see here.
There is an increase, what you can see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general expectation of the payment rate in the United States to the monument, well, in our case, we have a situation of resolution.
Behind the rate of occupation.
But then, this idea of learning is a pathology.
But it's not normal, isn't it?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
And it's not normal that most of the population lives in a sentence I defined -
But regarding parasity, dependence, because depending on the right to your wisdom, this to you can also be a family or the State.
(Laughter) But helplessness, because I consumed the available income without working.
I'm a friend who does it?
Theater is theater when I found these results?
And we were on the scene and I asked them.
And you, as you showed this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence, and you know what answered me?
With Epopopotam, it's the moon that lives on the backs of the hypothama, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, here, here.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
So the buffag or the buffaga on the scale, or on the other great mammals, these murderers also live on innovative renovations, on buffets, we have this film that will interest us for some of them in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
So, animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
By paying attention to the resources that the bottle supplies, which are insetti, larvae, flashes everything that host on the golden dorship, it's not clear that it's playing or that it's underwhelmed by the hell, although it's not.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not a psychologist, I'm a sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another: how can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society in which there is this kind of improductive consumption, the first one there I said to myself, "Is this the signorious society?"
Because the feminine society, like the feudal society in which there is a job that has placed in the conviction of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification: this is, indeed, a conviction.
Because it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
A: Yes.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission: in a signal and simple, classic society, we have the sign and the serves of the grey that are produced for him, in a signal society have become so many.
"Yes."
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the idea would define a doppy relationship, let's see why it can be called a legacy.
FdB: The relationship?
Because the buffaco with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food located on the therapy's shoulders.
The red light indicates one.
It's an advantage.
Because we can't, we don't need a buffer, but it's also from the perspective of producers, we also have a red light, a green light, the Epopopopopopotent is autonomous, we can'tpower it.
The situation is very complicated, and this is a situation of terrible, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
This is a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we come.
Access to work is very essential in our social system, but if the only inequality and inequality of access to work we can use the tools.
The analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent concentration of horses, which is the tool we use.
As an association measures, we can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have the means of work, who have a job that has both workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the position of the year is to be lost in the graduation, together?
And there is Turkey, a country where inequality reaches mass, but simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, probably, we will be the palm of this which is the abbiator.
This is the best situation in Norway.
AC: With the United States, mess in the middle.
Are you missing?
To become an Ox country, normally, seven million jobs.
But how did we get to this, this is the story?
For the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured that efficient decent, you can see something that's true, that inequality is the worst during monarchical age, particularly under the fasting, there are 7 million viewers of jobs in more than our families.
And it would be 1,000 euro per month, and in addition, it would be 12,000 euro income approximately.
In the year, and our state would be around 150 billion euros as much as health and school has been put together, more or less in Italy.
A: Yes, but that's it.
It's done here.
But there's one.
AC: Hi.
We also had the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution: "School is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
This is the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Paese refugee together with the Turkish of the West.
That's why.
But, or change things.
(Laughter) And we think.
The seven million work positions are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article one of the national reality, and things like a bathroom that prevents.
