(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently so far away: Be, you must know that, until some time, my two largest children, Mars and French, in order to sleep, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then the story begins with the little child: Riciolin, you're empty, but intrappolate.
It's terrible.
The words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, he is so much that proves to meet psychologists, logopists, all his brave professionals, but no one gets there.
To take this incase.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune.
Take a look at a little girl.
His name was Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Mrs. Teresa," but what beautiful words of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the forest of his country, they were celebrating a big party with a birthplace.
And a microphone, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the battles he had written, the comic fights were too big, and he said, "All of you, I'm a computer engineer, think they're so brave in the Internet that my first words just were web, web, web!
That's what happens: people were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That young man ...
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, "This is a bit the problem of having the Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, my debilitations.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What is a moment?
I talk about my disappointments and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me: finding a disability, you can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming parents?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
Trisomy?
21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They are the words of the little boy of Calcuta.
"One biasphate."
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a man and a woman." (Laughter) the doctor says, "Scus, sign, maybe she didn't understand, trisomy 21."
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "Oh, but there's a misery, we don't even know when we were able to produce NELA mask, but it's summ!"
And the dot has given the alarm to the dot, because ... (Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause) We can talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult of our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyone.
After a few months.
(Applause) And even the most beautiful thing that have brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that it has resulted all the best people, it has become the best of them, the best of their suffering, and all the people who, somehow, find.
Now this is not the potential.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are all very informed from the technological point of view of disability, especially from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, analyses, we know everything, but very few, very few of these people have had encounters with people.
And then, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Sound Anna", where so, without asking us too much about seriously, but not for anything, old, saying.
(Laughter) Or even another, where she says, "But it's true that you're wearing, but you know from one, like you go to school," and then we did this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you cause an illness of Down syndrome and you don't give up the eyes to dark," "Bella, this is called 'common of Down' because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in addition, I don't know, I'll give you an example: have you present TED talk?
You built a small X.
(Applause) Because I'll give you this example, because today, to know TED, talk to people, you've made a little bit of fat, here's the invitation is to make a little bit of fatal and don't forget the meetings of disability that will have in your life, both persons, but also some people around you, a very enjoyable recommendation.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a bathtub.
One grader under: Here, to wake up the eyes you have to look at the same level.
And in this sense, it captivates me many times of losing: that's why I like a politician to leave bricks along my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon.
With this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you.
To try to trace disabilities.
In your life.
To clarify it.
And most importantly.
Remember?
The pause.
What can you look at the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who sees or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And I understood what my mission in the world was, in fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds, nor a romantic disorder, as they told us about some speakers earlier, but for an ortag, it went well, it could go onstage, while swimming, ortags.
To make you realize how scary it scares every day, of how much scarc percentual it has happened to me, it's what has happened to me one night because of a traffic, and this thing has opened my mind, has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's what we can decide for us, for our family, every single day, and not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact.
Because our food choices everyday live a large part of our daily environmental impact: if we want to translate it into an index we could talk, for example, of ecological pressure, and it generates much more, what we choose to ordinary to the ristorant, or how we move to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
And then, obviously, to try to use 100% of the raw materials.
Mr.M.
Another thing of consumption is to optimize consumers.
And above all, also the way we make the interact every day.
So, what are we, indeed, carrying on a table?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
I'm scared, so, the less noble part.
So what optimizing in the kitchen means to simply recover these things and, in average, at least 50% of winter, we get to that up to 70% because many vegetables have more protein parts, so what it means to optimize in the kitchen is to change the approach to food, that is to have a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joint together.
Let's take an example with mine.
I can see her with me.
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also cost such an natural cake.
I looked for it.
Surely, I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that, if I buy the aircraft, it probably costs me more, the garden.
I focused on it and I strongly lasted it, so, if you don't like too much damaged by the chicken, you can concentrate on the bus, and it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit certainly for health, but not only with all internal features I can make you manage one thing, I think it's a practical example.
A very simple technology, but it allows us to transform, to value a technology.
Something we all have at home is that we usually don't stop looking at and traveling, so we optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that, changing our mentality a little and seeing with a different eyes.
In particular, ants, but all food, to spy less and appreciate it to the maximum: optimizing is also optimizing the consumption of energy heater, for example, every time I contain too much or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, here are other things.
Those of the vegetables just have a cable, it's not that it serves to know what, or sometimes with an appliance like vastwiglia, but it's a technique of very high cutlery, low temperature, so it doesn't occur to you with a professional instrument from 2000 euro, but you can simply use the vast food and all the time you're wearing jokes, like it is.
A very practical example: take a glass like this one, it must be full, full of catisports like you always, and then turn it on the draft you prefer, choose, you choose based, obviously, on the chicken path, not vice versa, and you made it up to zero, to this zero, and even more, obtaining a product that could hardly obtain with traditional techniques.
To also optimize the use of domestic intelligence I think can give beneficial interests: another application of optimizing this time to the acting, I enter even more at home in your home, when we were in war, OK?
There were plenty of food, we had few proteins, they would eat a lot of patates, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the cake, for example, the candles.
The protectiveatti was a party, and it was like this: now the problem is opposite, we have so much abbonding, and we have a little tendency.
To put in touch the doppy of proteins that are useful for us, because it's a problem, it's a problem because, in fact, if we eat swords or too slow, yes, we may put on the weight, but if we put on the behavior of proteins, in fact, we're affirming rivers, featured, and also increasing the risk of developing some patologies, but we also get to shake.
What can be from the legs, cards and fish, in fact it's really too abundant, eating so many vegetables, and in fact we take a large part of our daily protein sidewalk because, really?
To change more than what is used is a waste of resources, it is certainly something that we could improve, if more proteins are animal proteins that have certainly an environmental impact.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put a few less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have an important health of certainly environmental benefit.
Our healthy health, but also of the kings of all of our country, and even more if we did it at the global level, even in public sponsors for society, I think it's more efficient to try to persuade you, to put a few fewer proteins in the contact with a low environmental impact.
Those of you may be wondering: Be, in other words, in the next year, we will also be excited, and there are a lot of people who talk about food of the future, I can say so much about insects, personally I believe I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we are not a consumer of insetti, and I believe we'll hardly become it.
Which means a protective food, which is absolutely over zero, that we can nourish from vegetables, maybe not the ones that will carry to the store, but the things that we don't manage to use of what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the bones to produce us at home and that, any of us, any of us, can self-protect them.
I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, we had more foodmals than 35 years ago, a law that prevented us from collecting them, and we were also a chef, enough to know how to do, to celebrate your lungs at home, just a small packaging or a gold, a little bit of land, a retina, because they were used later for the cost and for the other to use.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to get rid of the inalated, or you can h uova, and then feed them with vegetables, so there's even more to hate the food patches, and twice in the year you'll have your roots in a primary, like an ortagger, they need a time of covering around a hour and then you can do what you want.
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room, that eat them and not that they will never eat them, of course they require a small change of mentality and lack of prejudice, so a sustainable revolution, I am convinced that it can be at the door of any of you and that truly makes a small change.
And the benefits are really many, they are for our health, for the well-being being less protected in theattoo, changing the way to see all the ingredients and unites me and become revolutionary.
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you. (Applause)
I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six dots, one that comes from one to the other: the other.
He went to ten faces: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you launch the data of ten gangs.
I don't know: you came to this game, put up with the same or largest number of mine.
[A.DE.]
six to five.
Otherwise, have you become the player?
Trying with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory.
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventh seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you will realize that the probability of victory approaches at 75%.
And with the mental of release, my stance based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portal must deliver to release in about 100 million data in just one second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the risks in mathematical problem, is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematician: a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo in an elegant way as we would be abused of the brutal force of computing.
To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
Now I'll give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
(Laughter) The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary level of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and humanity, unbearable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time alone on my computer or on a statistical background.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
So, let's put in motion a theme that is used for a mathematician to study West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, parallel.
Well, a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how tight you think, teach Maths and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I had left before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't care to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I accepted my degree, I started to live in instructions, I wasn't based on a preparation of loneliness, I had compassionated my students, engaged them and make them fun, trying to enjoy all opportunities, I got a diploma to more than 20 years old, to more advanced countries.
(Laughter) The fathers were the job positions, more than so much efficient, strong and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
But I had realised in every aspect of learning.
To prepare evolution is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I love, finally, the courage of the accounts: to read the students, the right mistakes they are, brings a continuous learning, and then there's the moment of the performance in class that become a showman.
(Laughter) What about the wow?
Every partnership, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) Around the students who paid for my whole bill, and I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
And, during the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's universality warned me the award for eccellence in education, as a young researcher.
(Laughter) In the cost of my PhD, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way.
But everything was so natural, beautiful, closer.
- Ah!
Well, in my little boy I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into place.
At that point ...
I have to check everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to that question on the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, that fuel, that dissemination?
But for the place I was given, it was my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
This is the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
Is there a concert?
Yeah ...
Behind TED, at this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, also a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
(Laughter) What about these goods?
There is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind was put in motion, at a moment in which I had tried to put in motion the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Applause)
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But we will be going to see.
We've also told this capital of my story, because I think that what I've learned is shared.
The Monte Calla's method, for example, is to undertake a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or to find finality in the street that there were no expectations, like catalizers of our talents.
And the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a preparation of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
I come in a good eye, I tell you the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
What about the time?
I land the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise I've prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to meet the friends of the five-year-old years, I collected everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have a final lesson.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had been practicing it for a long time, but there are plenty of materials online, and we have to find it written on the rear of the diagram.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
And I scratch to the washing machine, but often an animal to ask them how to procedure, to each point in practice, we would need a theory element, that we repeat the stages together, but I had the dinner of their gender book, I was well prepared, I had the cavity.
(Laughter) I stand with them to make them take the spiral.
It's a saying, come on, I invite you to get to the magnifying glass for the exam, a group of students get close, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
(Laughter) An ultimate student approaches me.
The solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
And finally ...
It was too courageous, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to tell you, thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
And I think that maybe I'm only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a more giant heart, to my place in this world.
So, this is what I want to tell you: mind and heart are connected safe, and for this reason.
When the mind in motion, even the heart, the battles fly inside the pitch, it's the mind runs in movement, thanks.
It's a physically starting the month of 9.9 million dollari, financed, and investigating cancer to the prostate, in more than 29 million dollari, and started to grow up, so Dario to Mosca, to Trento, to Tedarch Cirento, to Tresk Trek Trek Trek, to promote the dialogue, and the collection Found of Promovere the dialogue, and the Found of Promoção, to publish its owners, to promote the Mendon, and to promote the Mendon, and start to promote it, and turn it into the Mendon, and start to promote it, and turn it into the Mendrary, and start to promote it, and turn it into the Mendrary,
Good afternoon everyone.
Today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my prosthesis about leadership.
CR: In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book.
It's like often a captain, while I read and when I drink one thing, started to make me done by others, started to listen to different conversations, then there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It's a central topic: Samatina my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
your diversity.
If you feel diverse, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know itself to practice, and the opportunity appears right now, instead of diversity, which is how to integrate?
Everything that has brought a different background, remembering my daughter one day.
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so at some point, the girl says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Clo, are we really three men?
And she says, "No, no, her two, you know with mom."
I guarantee you this: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
And then this diversity, in fact, is exactly the right thing.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
And this is the difficulty a little, but, because if I want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders, change, that I've worked for many years.
In companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
And then, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
The word change thanks to this word change, I'm giving a thought that I don't know how many hours and I start putting into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and forming an encouragement, cake.
Great!
that in reality is a prison, it's a bit of achievement that, for me, of course, is a prosthesis of personal entirety.
Today, a leader must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an accident, it is to know that creative transformation and change.
And then, what's the new setting here, at least for me, at least the new ones?
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, in management.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the prospective change that ...
But what I thought was to take this leap, to do things, to fulfill pleasures, make projects, bring people from one part to another to be, and all that I do thank you.
What about the development of creative thinking, which leads her to move through this transformation?
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A bit of the ability to dream: to this model, we've imagined it later, through five years.
Filater fundamentals: the first one would know about transforming.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something related to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may be in their houses in marketing, rather than communication, but creativity is something that everybody has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
And it's true that you can learn, you can celebrate your simple creativity, in the morning we started with a tunnel, brainstorming, and that's one of the tips that allows you to fulfill your own.
Creativity: what do you do with creative thinking, try to work on divergent and convergent thinking, but that is not enough?
We need to take a leap and ...
Doing a slightly deliberate movement, right?
So?
Committing to involve that which is the emotional part, the frame of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first: here, attempting to the absence of security to their emotions, those forces, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel a judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that to do this.
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a modification of fear, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, consciousness of the two emotions leads you to do this.
Transformations.
They look at them, as they say, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of people.
Opportunity: we say in management, we can produce food, but in reality?
I'm not so much for the idea of managing.
But how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is to support the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can have a free spiral, and how to relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and this is not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were achieved only in one way.
It's an opportunity to build a climate with its own actions.
I also have the opportunity to do what?
To explore new definitions.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
Well, there's a simple competition here, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, better than I say it, better than I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins, and what's interesting when we get to this situation is: "How am I doing?"
It allows me to collect creative spirit.
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, that necessarily ...
It doesn't happen if it doesn't make an organization, even if it's about reinventing a very customer relationship, because the prosecutive is completely changed, then, to return to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
So the sense of attention we've seen in the video is, as to say, love is the volcano for the development of creative thinking, but this crappone clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but most of all.
The thing of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
And then that's it.
So, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to land.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
So there's the chance.
To see from above.
The most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
of the man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They can live not all separated, but together.
It's like...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better?
Placing this phenomenon?
The limit.
And this is a story that goes back in time, actually this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money in this city.
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and they became quite famous.
Kar Marx is his friend Hang.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They were stripped, without daughters.
Besides, it's a bucket.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
It was called "the conviction."
The classroom operated in the city.
When they accused the city of all the bad guys in the world, the city to be ...
It's the cause of inequality, of insecurity, of poverty.
And there was no other way.
What limiting this phenomenon was possible to say?
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Behind, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
Nacquevo!
Also, the discipline of tools to limit this phenomenon, I realized that it was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendousness that, maybe, some of you have heard about, has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a glass at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or even in the end, the Zonization that fortunately you haven't met all, but who has even managed to say?
And pretend to imagine?
In a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot against the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It has a prison where all the world's challenges are launched by the upset and can be scanned for you.
But what's interesting about this process?
It's that, like all the processes, this leads to adventure a little lungar from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
Otherwise, I'm a member of science.
This feeling is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
We know that the city is not the cause of all the world.
Under the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution.
All the greatest questions here are related to the human brain.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
The security is the economic development, the work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Congratulations.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The mentors that motivate this ability than the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, you can see myallel, my photo made from the upset of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities?
Imagineations that can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks, and also ignore the name of the most famous people.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Here's my idea.
That the city, in the end, is scared, and in some way addressed as a solution?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The bigness.
The inhabitants are all used to confront this other city for the inhabitants, for the massive, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solves.
The greatest questions of humanity?
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I have different interests.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
To be young people who have different goals.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, depending on individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
It's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Why?
Maybe right now?
After thousands of years of history, these abilities are temporary suspected.
Walter!
Magari?
Keep calm, perhaps you may consider that right now, or for some flaws?
Remember how to be.
This is the B.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
These measures and tools of containment of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
It's the job I've been doing in the last years.
And that they are not afraid.
The Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
You can feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast!
With utopia and courage.
The first example?
It's from Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From that satellite.
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
What about us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving towards the city.
The idea is...
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbitical stage that every day can walk, as I did.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps, can you imagine?
It's a element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
The first sentence of solution, cities like nurses.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have in mind those who become.
The second example is now that.
in a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What could we do with this city in 2030 with all of them, Buenos Aires, more than in other years?
The País is the magnet.
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed, was in some way untouched.
Violence, poverty also derived from a higher national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
It limits development.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
It's possible to believe.
In the power of this mental weapon.
What are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do Zyo accelerate?
And what do you see as an asset?
A shell of intensity, which means a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician:
The creation of pedonal spaces or glasses, you can see this friendship.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build...
Situing?
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency but of the whole world and the creative gatherings.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I am a buffer.
That allows us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
And the spacies?
Diver and pedonals.
And these tragedies together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
Do you know?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Third.
And Makaki.
Sitting the place on the spotlight, robbing from the top.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
So many times.
And maybe?
Are you very proud?
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
The words are important.
They put us in ideation.
They give way to our thinking.
The words of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They're evocating that they're full of stories, of vibrations, of emotion.
I'm a son.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And you see beauty of our language?
And it's done that this beauty is played, preserved, perceptible.
Again.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'd like to talk about A.
Madea Montcante.
The English word: menstration.
The idea is often motivated by darkness.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But it's been a bit long.
And I'll start to show you.
Some endless twins.
There are many Latins on their insecutions and the largest universities in the world, and they show them with a big budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana.
Incodea, induced.
In Svetia.
In the unite leg, the Kins College de Ronda, on the coast united to Oxford.
In Chicago, in the United States.
Great!
It says "You know," in your insurance.
Not just that.
(Laughter) universities.
Happyly.
Dichiarian, if it's in Latin, eh?
Londra has a Latin motto.
That's it!
It has a Latin motto, Canada has a Latin motto.
The 15L, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not just that.
The American Marina says, "I've finished it, you've never heard it, always did."
In a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even a prostitution there is no stone to be a passportist like NASA.
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
What about this?
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What is the recent marriage of the Rome city, has proven and launched the Human municipalities?
That's it.
It doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, Miandyu," "Wow, Mendyu," what is this subsidiary of allegae?
What is this contamination, this quote between two crazy lines that gives sense to each of us what are with the five pallets high?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
But why... but because when we are all the tourist attacks of all the cities in the world, there is no one who makes the insensite thing to settle their name.
I was promising.
None of them?
Only to Sundays.
"Daddy of ugly" has its own petition.
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
(Applause) A round of applause for Benicuto Ministry: Look how nice!
Risconta?
(Laughter) "No, it's not very nice to see, Beautiful," "So we're Italian, in a way completely insensitated."
From Italian speaker, we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about Italian, the most romantic language in the opposite world of Rolling New York.
I'm from Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguists, I know.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, don't do anything.
For example.
The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us.
Pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States in front of the negotiation map with the same quantity of the negotiation map that sell to hamburgers or...
(Anglese) Inglese: win the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
Keep here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Lucca, meaning nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote in the week of Italian wine, they'd say, (Laughter) why the Brazilian Resistant of New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
That's it.
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
That's it.
It's what scratches the revive magician, Italian fashion.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the "winter."
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
"Maspet, why should I call them?"
An act.
Do you think it was like a mountain road in the Gran Canyon?
And not "thomosome."
How are we going to be at our Devener?
And the women we see in ours?
Good afternoon.
Try it.
But you see, there are no colors.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy, and it speaks English.
There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if we perfect the union?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call us, the calls, this, "I'm on the Onse."
It begins.
The radicies of the seems Catitalian.
We are segmented.
That's it.
The curious thing, because over two Italians, over two, there was no English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) And here we have to spare that the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled the sign, who has compiled this model of the island, are better than linguistic competitions.
However, every day, for immigration, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are ortovinal.
Let's use a quantity of English words that don't need.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The clockery is the "lockering" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We call it "competite of compilation," we say "castone" of "the ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we have to give up a shoot of toothpaste fences united from the caste to "satisfaction."
(Laughter) With business united.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because the unit is always like that, flat and genital.
The journalism and the e-mail share it not only in companies, but also in media: recording public.
The Govern.
We have a law from the State called Jobset, and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't solve it much better.
And I've forced the newspapers in Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I've added:
I had to do something: communicating my marriage, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, to put a start on the streets, "Ped".
Fat.
Sensibilization activates this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
I'm a bit of energy.
But this petition?
It invites me.
Public public records, the government!
The printers, the media, to say it.
In Italian?
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for us.
A speech from the year.
But not what happened.
In less than a month they filmed, putting names, cognitions, addressing, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spray that the engineer has signed directors and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed meetings and professionals and called pensioners, signed up.
Italians were saying, "What are we doing with our language and they signed the story of it in Italy?"
All over the world.
Singapore, the Jalemy Aggetto, Pedudal, South Africa and Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with movement: I have spent hours.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
I'd like to talk to you about one, the Italian is a right.
But also avere: we're in the bread of the bread; if we think abundantly, we talk about other tango bondly: working in a public record, assistance.
I've studied Classic Alice, but I've worked with economists, (Laughter) an Italian and an English decent, "It's going to be better than a stage, the English, Sisher" and we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, go Rome's food."
(Laughter) First of all, I started missing out about our language, because I'd never like to say to myself the diagnoses and functions that occurred by occasions.
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We sign because I don't believe those who say "cool" or "cool".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
(Laughter) First of all, I want to understand what politicians say that ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old.
Thanks for the motors.
That's it.
I thought it was an extraordinary transversal echo, because in mass media, they imprisoned this thing from zero cost, on the Internet.
The year amplified.
And this initiative is used.
They talked to them together, grammares and serves on the stamps of the dispublic, but they gave great applause to the side of Italy and sale.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
He hasn't spoken about Christian family, he has spoken today that behind a drag, a transversality.
"What?"
And it is estimated all social resources, a little bit of core and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and colors to the most populated ones.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in the interactions, I also had to put myself in the city, and on the beach of PLARG, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from an Australian radio, from an English.
Well, we need it.
That's it.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
In conclusions for some reason to do it, to operate but it helped us understand from all of us and it's a fact of democracia, because it makes us understand a democratic fact.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the agend, bring it to the world, because it presents it.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
Be the best.
And then.
"That doltine is tolerated!"
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonaldo himself defined "Homo Litter."
Because he scratched in flight, that is in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Go to the Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
(Laughter) We resign to express one of those feature.
From its flessuosity.
What about her?
Wonderful!
Potentiality.
Our specifically Italian creativity.
It's the 10 in your language kills.
What's more, if our linguistic thesis is strong and used to it, we can bring some strange techniques, why personality?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
With gender measure, I used it to an excess.
Finally, nothing, misunderstood.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom to parents or to change?
I started to see if I was still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young woman, like everyone went to school, I was and dressed with friends, but what is behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the dead part of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back and reclaim...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, love, hatred that are strongly altered: fear, rage, sadness, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
It's the difficulty to focus.
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzy behaviors your parents could have.
But, in addition to this, you should have to manage habits and their emergencies, without anybody prepared to do it, how to manage the situation, while your father or your mother saw many things that don't exist psychosis, or even assist, or settle off, suicide attacks.
But how do we add all this?
Furthermore, we also have to live all the time, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that we add another goal.
It's often not able to talk to anyone.
There's science.
That your mother or Tovaban, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and determined to ereditate the same discourse.
But what if you tried to say that your mom or your grandma?
They have a metaphoric disorder, a bipolar a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, mum, something that doesn't answer the foreign world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health and mental health don't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a ring to understanding what happens inside you and your love, a ritary to ask and receive access many times when you don't receive a cure, and if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
[A.DE.]
The weather that we perceive around you is difficult to communicate inside you and then the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the embarrassment can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside fear, anger, and a pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from others.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to pull, that no one from the school imagined.
When the first grade started to open, at that time, when, for the first time, light started to filter, I remember again the psychologist of the family council, the first person placed out of the family, where I could open myself, and that helped me progressively, and even if I was there for myself.
Later on the Internet on the forum, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things my parents had gave me.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
But it's statistically impossible, in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to find out that there is no other person who has experienced the same things we've experienced.
And do you know why it happens, why not talk about our children's stories?
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced, and realize that they were natural reactions to what I've experienced, but we could also see the positive characteristics that were born precisely to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path by myself, and I went to a huge owner, which gave me energy right now, I saw the story I had experienced, but also the story of writing, their view, the pain, but also the ability to transform the pain together for a change, that I didn't recognize myself, but that I saw the reflection in their endings.
As not to risk again to caricature the world's weight on my homes, and that's how we live today, in 2017 with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association created by children for other children, and it's called "Pacco," "Pacco," and "Noff Mentaly," the Parliament, Fili, Fili, parents with dissuppy.
We've given the way to a project that has gone from the bottom, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room right now, who have grown up in this same desire, they have given us the challenge to start, by parents' children, with a mental disorder.
At first, when I thought about this project, I was detailed: I would never make it realised how I would do it and find so people in civil society who probably didn't experience this experience, who wanted to become our own posts in the change, and bring a member of the mini guida in the owner of our community's library.
And now we are able to get to so many regions, from the seed to Sicilia and Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach all of them, and the other wish we have is to stop the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
You'll have to see a house of atoms to make fronts.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the shifts of life, being disenged, even if it's too bad.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
It was one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that our parents with mental disorder have is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open for us, and we can enter the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Aron Smart.
Well, when they've dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014, the year initolated by the Internet-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category: it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher; I'll surely play a hacker in a sense of sound.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
(Laughter) Four years ago they were in a group that scratches the queue, maybe you don't say much, but it was Ubic in Bloco Sfera, up to ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today the Creative Commons are around a part of content, they are free licenses, they believe the most flexible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
A few years later, a small start-up started building something that co-founds something called a network, becomes a millionaire, from one day to another; to Aaron, honestly, he didn't take so much money and fame, he continues to do what has always done to build a open and collaborative internet, with digital memory archives.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high school law, and that a few years ago some of them even Wikipedia has become a monopoly.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
AC: What in ARON is absolutely overwhelming is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronna tells it himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 years old, all the tasks of economy, political theory, the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
I tell her mother that, at some point, she was kicking her, and an air had two and a half years ago, was killed in the segelone and had her avenue on the fridge she had just attacked me.
The calamite.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creative Commons are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
(Applause)
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
A power movement that we just have to think of a second, we're everywhere, we're in schools, libraries, universities.
Power information comes from Mility, also from Montessori, which means giving access to information to people means making a democratic act, our democracia democracy, based on giving access to education education, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this?
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
(Applause)
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
None.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Huxas.
Great movement for free access to scientific literature.
And the world of scientific literature, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely caotic and controversial world.
Well, very few, big publishers ...
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
And they told them, "But why?
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
ASBAI had taken care of it.
It's not an act.
Of this genius, it's probably not been observed.
Does your opportunity to do that Aaron's, another one?
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
"Yes."
It comes with aromine facts of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats and could do it, but not in this scenario, and they are answered actors of computer pyramid, up to 35 years.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first to the rest.
They stopped at home in New York.
She was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people wanted to access information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: No, no.
But that's not how you do it.
Sound ... (Laughter) Thank you.
Now, all the tables will get out.
FdB: That's what I'm talking about.
The choir is Happy Feel do Fairy.
You feel guilty!
"Yeah, no!
Attention is a little more important for what is called a sports system: how we can cut down the autostrui for Craking Chong or Craking.
And it's one more important thing.
The linear is a bottle, a little trod in Messen, and the Michelin was.
So, how do you do it?
To give you an idea: this mix of immersion of a winter of the universe.
It's basically.
And this is a little third, the last year I thought, "When do I like it?"
Do you have to know what the truth is?
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
Mass spionerform is used to spy, to control, for or first, there's another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, free, a full space, freedom of expression; actually, these things are...
These are two big winds, things that coexist in the same way, the Internet is too complex.
To be just one thing.
What can we do?
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning goes on.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make it last and give it space.
Good afternoon everyone: So, in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly, I had a look at theattoo.
It's duty.
Do you have all how many?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was overwhelming, no, it had a argument: in our gallery there are hundreds of thousands of bolts, most of them are the oldest of our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half years, then, if life was apparent?
Well, on some other planet, around one of these very ancient sisters, so very first.
Because on Earth, we could appear in an intelligent species wing, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, than we do, maybe we'd be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been informed of none of these intelligent civilizations.
And here's the question to close, I want to say, "Where are all how many?"
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it has become many more simple, it's that there's no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible: I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a hooded sky.
I asked myself if, around those bright bright lights, could be planets, planets of living beings, that perhaps in that moment were waiting for my vocation, they are asking the same question, we are alone in the universe.
Our species has also been learned with all the other species of the planet, and we actually come here, we all descend from an old antenna.
One: and I want to find the scientific evidence of the existence of other worlds inhabitants, I believe it would be a third big paradeable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two.
For this reason, well, in the last years we have probably done many things going on in the direct of a possible answer: we still don't have one answer, but we are the first human beings.
To have scientific evidence that there are pianists around other stars: this is one of the biggest identities of astrophysics in the last 20 years, 20 years ago, we would be able to suspect it.
To understand many things, to understand, for example, if they have an atmosphere, so to understand if there are indeed habitable conditions, but we have tools that are very likely, every bottle of our galaxy, we also know that many of them are the highest distances of their holes, to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so planets, planets, potentials that could tell us that one of these planets, in effect, one of these planets, of these planets could be.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be witnesses at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I'm sorry, I think it's a real change for all of us, one of the questions that we can make all of us reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare religions, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us, from an ocean of fold space, the universe really is really very big, and then I'll give you an example, a specific example, this son of my mirrors, like you and Geruno, that has become farther away.
The land has been traveling for a quarantine of years, and has reached the stars of the Solar System, and has entered the space in testtelling, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km later, 17 km per second.
So it's a huge speed, but I mean, how much this one's going to add.
This space probe for us to reach the closest athlete in our country, Proxima Centauri, if they travel in that direction, it would bring us 74,000 years.
It's a longer time than any citizen civil society is.
It's existed on our planet.
We could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels at maximum speed consent in nature.
What does it imply?
For more than four years to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that, but we are surely like isolated, we are in a sea in a flat space.
The fact that keeping present is time.
And we use it.
An example of the writer Jobs McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand was recording and the tip of my hand's dates, and the transcender time between the formation of our planet and Earth and today, four billion in the middle of years; it's great; the first forms of life, unicolaries, antennas, and, from all forms of life, may stop on our planet, and the Earth, and today, four billion in the middle of years.
The dust of the hand to the side is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most completed by a network of billions of cells, animals, plants, and dinosaurs appear.
At the end of the palm of your hand drowning.
(Laughter)
In the beginning of the last speech, an natural, catastrophic event, very likely, during this long history of life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet are similar.
So this gives us the idea that...
This long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long path, difficult, accident and governed by ...
They were unbelievable, and that didn't necessarily have to bring to the origin of more complex organisms and not that we should bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
That's what we do.
In all this, where are we?
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because we know it today.
That for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been with us other human species that are no longer there, like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be shocking, incurable, compared to life times.
of the Universe.
Surely, they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they've completed a certain level of technological progress, to feed themselves, or simply get involved with harassment, they spark, without leaving.
In a track of the universe, then maybe that.
Big cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a bit like a warning species, maybe we are saying something.
Life had to overcome it?
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species.
From far away, let's imagine ourselves seen from another planet, well, if we disappear.
Domani.
Probably, in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
Let's think of a very young species: As soon as a seventh started to fly, to communicate on radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived at the residents of the Solar System, but we really put the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounded us?
And I think that waking up here really would be a bit like a hood, and we, as diferencia of the dinosaurs, we have at least part the chance of...
We certainly have the capacity to feed ourselves, but we also have as I believe, and I want to change, to influence our destination.
The possibility of helping scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us to guarantee.
The long future, in which we will continue to find wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day life on some other ...
The planet is expensive, maybe in a far away future, so far as to reach other stars.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive the longest possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep access until we get this wonderful dive that fits consciousness, sorry, in case.
A small planet lost in the middle of the cosmos.
Thank you.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before, classifies, but from the done sport and generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that is likely...
Then, just believe it, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
(Audience) Yes!
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 km, which later became 100, or two, because Centro Quattro was another very few: no, I didn't even include you two, because you know a number that will come back in a long time, this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All of us?
The competitors, instead of running, instead of being worried about coming the first, or coming in the last few, we came together after these 16 Chilean aggrees.
The journey and the difficulties, right now, in the first days, we're terrified in Windok, which is high inside the map, and after six hours of travel, there's enough difficulties, we arrived in my desert, the oldest desert in the world, for this kind of garage.
(Audience) Yes!
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has been taught me, the number six, yet: this know that becomes an important number.
This is an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first cover, the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 kilometers all of us, we do them during our studies, but in the desert is the in general, the rope is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things.
Later, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a fire, or if it's time, or to do something beautiful, you have to move forward and know energy.
There's always the chance to react, and I, the first difficulty I have been to after three Chileans.
Calm down the sun!
(Sound of soccer) You want them to do it for this gift and guinea pig.
(Laughter) Okay, so you put me... (Laughter) I don't like it anyway!
For this reason, I couldn't mold, because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to collect money from the fight against Roblastoma, at Roblastoma, it's a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, I before this experience, I didn't know very well its existence, and when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert because it's wisdom.
Do I calculate it?
Many hot people: in the desert I had various problems, brains, feature, and situation sent it like that, because we had to move forward and taught me so much, he taught me that, during all our journeys, during the tap that started to settle up the ground schedule, the heat, we felt inhabitable, we felt inhabitable.
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, powerful, but unfortunately, in the desert you realize that you're a punctuum, and at a certain point in the middle of the desert, a afternoon that moved to eat, stood, scavening from the bridge, it was like to take a sheet from a store.
And I don't know if you know that with salary, I can make food, and I don't know if you know, but with salt I also do medicine, he was happy for the abuse.
The anamibian desert is the desert I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there's the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters away, and when you're here, we've made it of race or almost.
It's strange, you can see it there, on the tip of the bar that then split from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because my desert doesn't exist, it doesn't.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, only five Chileans were left.
(Laughter) We are already in Mexico City, which also corresponds to a pack of the world here in Namibia, and that's what we do now.
(Laughter) Sorry, at the same time, four kilometers for the fact of two, (Laughter) but they will be fully aware and happy.
And thank you all that you're wearing strength.
(Video) Ricardo: Look, there's no more.
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when the city, in this morning, talked about the small principle of my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, there were more than 26 people because it was a motorcycle race.
With many contents: 96 were 96 people who had traveled with me, in the end, the last two km could also not do them, because the challenge was 104 had a long time, and in the end, a magic, an amazing magic.
As you can see the Earth, there are all very hostile, I also have the part, because the leaves were a bit rigid.
And so, this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed the sideline to give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician cabin, you can go back, do the other Chilean to go back, to reach 1006.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to get to these...
(Music) The melted food was over and achieved its goal, on December 20th, 2016, that if you take the figures, they are exactly the numbers that make 16 Chileans, or even 16, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
I was sometimes captaining people to think.
And I was surely facing 100 meters and already made it fatal: (Heavy breathing)
I wasn't alone.
Well, guess!
Look: "Haha".
Looking at having a wife that's enough, I had two children, a bit bigger, Riccardo, who's already ten years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old, and Pietro, of course, had already understood: it's the situation, but, unfortunately, life sometimes, gave us difficult things, I don't have life.
It's a bit like...
Like the corsa.
What I said before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
AC: This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating emorecity, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the birth, and it lowered hardly, and this is the last time I saw him smiling.
[The public sends a bathroom]
And...
So, when?
When did it look?
When it seemed like everything went well.
Hmm, February 18.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack.
Because it was too tall, OK.
The garage is called Ran "16 Pitro," you've understood the number 6.
BB: And then ...
Clearly not male.
It doesn't.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments?
You don't have to let go.
And it needs me.
(Applause) But you have to continue to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And Riccardo continues to move forward in life.
To give the chance to the other two that arrived: is it arrived at Emma?
Emma came on January 29th to San Pietro.
And eventually Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and I didn't want to drop myself, so I had to do what to manage to create or improve my life, to improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but above all from there.
From the physical point of view, to be able to give strength to people, and to be me stronger, and so I started running the first image you see on the record is my first marathon mix, the queen of seeing will be very beautiful.
I ended up arriving in the anamibia desert, where these 116 km have led me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you can see there the little house, which I wanted to take 21200 euros.
It's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
This year in November, it was in the desert of Omanna and Chileans will be 165.
So here, there are also variations of many - 165 kilometers completely in self-sufficience, so I'm only going to the water, we see to get to the end, but it's the desert is diverse, but the objective is always the medal, which is to get to pick up the money to help children and make it better, the message so I can do it today is an important message.
It's all the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always there is hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
From 2017.
Three times I know, come with me.
As you want to interpret it, thanks to everything.
