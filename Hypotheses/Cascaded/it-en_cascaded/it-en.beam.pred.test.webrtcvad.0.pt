(Applause) See you find power and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently far away: Be, you must know that until some time my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, in order to sleep, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
The words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune.
There was a little town called Teresa.
Say the culta.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
You'll ask a child, whatever happens.
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
And then...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting ...
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, can you imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor?
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble, right?
But the wish of this young man to try the battles he had written, the fought comics was too big, and he didn't think about it: free of the surgeon, take the microphone and says, "Salva todos, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the Internet that my first words as I've been born are web!
That's what happens: people were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That this young man, at that time, was that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
(Laughter) And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility...
[A.DE.]
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What's a moment, I talk about my flexibility and they take away the best part.
This also works the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But, as in all stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
(Laughter)
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
The 21st trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, that's an obsession, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) the doctor, and subsequent, sign, perhaps he didn't understand, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
The doctor is always more spoused, nearby, and my wife answers, "I understood this great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "A misery carrier, we don't even know what we were able to do the NELA mask, but it's dark."
(Laughter) The doctor we gave the alarm to the doctor, because ... (Applause) Thank you.
We'll talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, after a few months ...
Anna has arrived, it's the present, it's a marvelous one, it's very beautiful, it's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
What if this isn't the power?
But we have noticed one thing: that all the people we meet are all very informed from the technological point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all hundreds of villages, of analysis, we know everything, but very few, very few of these people have had encounters with people, where so, without predicting too much seriously, but exactly for nothing, older people.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use it, but you know, a little while ago, Francesca came home and said, "You know you're wearing a school girl," "Bella, and you're going to be here?"
So this part is here.
Or another one, where he says: "But it's true that you suffer from Down syndrome and you don't wear blue eyes," "Bella, this is said with Down syndrome," because we believe that even words have their importance, and even because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome more, I don't know, I'll give you an example, you have a TED talk.
Have you made a small X?
(Laughter) (Applause) No, why I give you this example, because you, today, for ... (Applause)
To know TED, to talk to people, you've done a little bit of a factory, and here, you can't avoid the uncontrollables of disabilities that will have in your life, both persons, but also people around you, a very simple recommendation.
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to give us a step forward, a grader underneath, here, in order to look into the eyes, we have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me to often lose myself.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to find discourse of disability in your life, to enhance them, and especially ...
And do you remember that the pairs that were able to look in the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like Maoce, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And thanks to a traffic, I'm very fortunate, and at that moment I decided that what I'd done, what would be my mission in the world, I wouldn't have to give up and try to make the world just a few more sustainable, starting the food.
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact, because our food choices of every day are usually a large part of our daily environmental impact: if we want to translate it with an index, we could talk, for example, of an ecological pressure.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And it's very simple, but it's a good sense, to try to use 100% of raw materials, my word of ordinary is one, and it's optimizing, saying that almost more one word is referred to domestic economy, probably, which is the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our informe with food.
So what it means to optimize in the kitchen is to simply recover those things from rejects, and especially the way we compose the bact every day, the bact, so that what we're actually wearing a table, or a candle, but I can also see it as a bunch of four ingredients, for example, polar.
With this implication, I made chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us a cake, a cake.
And it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit certainly for the health: it's less than the dust, so maybe if you don't like too spicy doll, and there's a fantastic thesis that you buy the euphorizery, it's probably hard to be more, but not only with all the internal behaviors, I can transform and value what we all have at home and see with a different approach.
To use it as well to cure, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure you've made a professional tool for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use domestic waste, I think we'll get, in some way, or all the times I pick up the toothpaste or the vegetables, and in the middle of the players, like always, and then get the job you've chosen.
And truly, when they could put the table on, for example, cards, cards and fish, certainly a small effort from all of you, we have so much abbounding, and we have a little tendency, and more importantly privileged, the animals with a huge environmental impairment, which can be an elevator.
Those of you may be wondering, well, in other words, we aren't just a comedy country of insects, and I think we'll hardly become one, but here is a representation that any of us can self-produce them, in other words, a protein food, which is absolutely hosting up to zero.
I'm a gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition, here in the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, we had more foodmen than an athlete, about 35 years ago a law stops us from collecting them.
There's so much to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, you just need to know what to do: to save your moon that at home is enough a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of land, a queue, and not make them scape.
As simple as that, I'm a very optimistic person, so I really hope to see if I don't have anybody here, maybe the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room, that eat them and not that they would never eat them, of covering an hour, and then you can do what you want, so, for our happiness and our planet.
(Music) The other has gone with ten gangs: if I turn it out any value from one to ten to the same probability of dancing, one has a common data with six gangs, you will be part of one to six.
Now let's play: you'll launch the side of ten gangs, come to this game, add an equal or largest number of mine.
(Audience): Yes.
When you're five or maybe you've played the game, win with the fact that 10 face is easier, but do you know me more approximately what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach based on the experience: can I explain to myself, repeatly, data and take the grades of each victory?
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventy seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you'll see that the probability of victory approaches 75%.
(Laughter) With the increase of releases, my stomach based on the media of the succession becomes more precise: this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of the big numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
(Laughter) Your door must deliver to release to around 100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo methodo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics: a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo poco elegant, as if we were abused of the brutal strength of computer science.
(Laughter) I was rather a magical way, and for this, four years ago, I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Whispering) Now let me give you the data.
[Yes!]
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, or my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and unbearable humanity, but the doctorate doesn't do for everyone.
Dieters ITA see there are 1010 failed attempts, the dotted is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and which is based on innovative research.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time on my own, on the front of the computer or on a statistical background.
(Laughter) In order to confront these shocks it would be a very lonely passion that I wasn't proved to.
So, here in movement, there's a topic that is based on an argument from a mathematician that studies west, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than we were, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how much, you think they're taught in Maths and in English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, all that I had left before.
Why is that?
Because all that water ...
(Laughter) I didn't want to answer that question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to maintain this state of euphoria, and so I accepted my degree, I started to live in lessons, and I wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to prepare solitary, I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, and make them fun.
And then, it wasn't about work for me.
Farming the equation is a creative, stimulating process, a form of art: I made realises in every aspect of embarrassment.
I really like to correct the contents: to read the readers' reads, right tricky they are, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a show.
And in each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) The gratitude of the students paying for my whole bill, and I'm talking about them as much they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
But at the cost of my doctorate, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way.
(Laughter) It was all that natural, beautiful, brilliant.
In my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
That's how I talked to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, fuel, the limitations of determination?
By the place I gave myself, I learned how to be and in values that I grew up with, the values that we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
A concert, a passion, a talent, happiness: Well, TED is this event, or a book, a trip, or experience, anopenion, even a moment of silence.
Among these benefits there is also knowledge: I have found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
My mind had started moving at the moment in which I had tried to put the lies of my students in motion.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Laughter) As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But let's see, I told you this captain of my story because I think that what I learned is shared.
Monte Calla's method, for example, is to undertake a path that doesn't reveal what we thought, or find finality and motivation through the street that there were no expectations, as catalizers of our talents and the share culture.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
He invited me to teach.
(Applause)
It's an interaction between high school exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom, and the microphone was OK, my three color penales were colored, I entered a good eye, I laugh at the scavenger.
At its care of the time, I turn off the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise will also be prepared will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl in the first row asked me if I could give some attention to the questions I asked.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night watching the kids of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have a final lesson.
Another guy, a few seconds ago, asks me where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had very little time for this practice, but there's a lot of material online, and there's a place to show it on the rear of the diagram.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
But every point in practice we created a theory element, that we repeat the issues together, someone asks a very difficult question, but I had a dinner of their gender book: "They're well prepared, I'm the cavo."
I work with them to make them take the spiral, a flight instruction, I bring them to the magnifying glass, but most of them are reassuring.
Behind, my last student approaches me.
(Laughter) The solemn, asks him to talk, seems strange, maybe he's looking for the words just.
(Laughter) At the end, the courage is only to tell me.
We have to copy.
But I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
I stay only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe this is exactly my place in this world.
(Music) Here, this is what I want to tell you: I'm your heart in movement, thank you, and for this reason, when your mind is in motion, your heart beats strong inside your pet.
(Music) A physician three of Trento, Astakumovend, and they start to make us 1509 million dollarers, asking our love to donate on the model, finance already with research on cancer to the prostate, in more than 21 countries, in greater than makers' health.
(Applause)
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
CR: Right in the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a bit of Jesco killed in a bar, carrying a book.
And as it was often a captain, while I read and while doing something, it started to make me some others, it started to listen to extreme conversations, then there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It was a central theme, Samatina, my colleagues would have presented it in a very clear way: now, what is interesting about the change is that, as they've already told us about the law.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
Your diversity, your diversity, your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing then?"
The opportunity seems that here, right now, from diversity, in other words, how to integrate it seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, actually, doesn't know how to use, right?
Everything that has brought a different back, remember one day my daughter: "Hello!"
It's a mom home, we had a family of friends, girls. So, at some point, the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Look, we are really three men, and he says, "No, they both love each other!"
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the straight below.
To do something different.
(Laughter) I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and this is the difficulty a little, but because if, on one hand, I want to create a culture of change, on the other, I need to create change leaders, that I've been working for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
Then, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States, writing on a paper, it's not the immediate thing.
The word change thanks to this word change, I get a thinking that gives me that I don't know how many hours and starts putting into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and forming an encouragement, cake.
[A.DE.]
Kaching, which is actually a presa, is a bit of achievement that, in my opinion, clearly, this is a prosecutive of personal whole, a leader today of willing to know, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to take, but to be present and lead the change, to the cake is an act, and it is a creative, of transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then, the prosthesis, the change of perspectives I make a project, I've paid on the project, but the transformation that I've brought, and in this way there's a transformation that can be transformed into me, it's not what I've thought, but, to take this leap, to do things, to take pictures that move on this transformation.
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we have already imagined it through five fundamental pillars.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists, or someone who may maybe take care of the workshops, rather than communication, but creativity is something that affects everyone, adds the environment in which you are.
(Laughter) And if that is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can join your creativity: what you do with creative thinking, try to work on divergent and convergent thinking, but that's not enough.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve the emotional part, the face of emotions, we have heard of emotional intelligence first, here are those, when you know about your emotions, you can allow you to support judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing this ...
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a change of rule, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotion gives you to do this.
Verees change towards how to say inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and thus the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of speaking.
Opportunity, we say in management, creating the weather, but I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader.
To identify that with their behaviors they can create other things.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can have a free spiral, can, as to say, to relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not always the same amount of organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were achieved only in one way, on the other, but to lead the opportunity to do that, to explore new discoveries.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit that is a child to imagine something and, suddenly, do it, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Will I convince me to collect creative spirit?
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, which necessarily reveals if you don't have an organization, you can also reinvent the very client's relationship, because of that original cave...
So, the idea is exactly ...
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To find ourselves in the situation of being aware, to expand the creative spirit, but of putting ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in that way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not so wrong.
So the sense of attention we saw in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking.
We have courage, on the one hand, to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, to create a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen first inside you and then out, so in a few words, the courage to use, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We're about to land, to drop your confidence belts.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance to see from above.
It's the most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention of man.
The city, and it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible that millions of people?
thousands of years near these places to be together, as well as mass.
They live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And you'll also have an important question to your forehead: But is it positive or negative?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not so much, and in fact, in this city, the biggest process of history began with the most experienced sentence.
And the process is obviously the process of the city, and these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were living in Manchester, and they didn't see what today captivates you when you were doing your weekend, New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They used to be strade, without leaves, without poverty.
The real smoke that did indeed matter, but not the one of today.
that carbon particles also prevented one with the other.
And, of course, both writes with the book, which was called the operating class in the city.
When they accused the city of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be the cause of inequality, of inequality, of poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon possible, it was like saying.
A malign behavior, a lurgical thing you see here behind, one thing you would need sometimes but to contain, and from this, over the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent, I was also born with the discipline of the tools to limit this phenomenon, which was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
And astonishing that, maybe you've heard about those with bizzy tools: one is called Lizonly, which is the rock where, when you have changed a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who has even arrived to say and to pretend to imagine a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house, there was a trade, a theater.
(Laughter) And then, we also imagine films, the culture that impacts a lot on cities.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable isolation model, a city full of violence and land, so much to drop it, and maybe for those who watched the movie, you remember, like all processes, maybe even for the abandonment a little, from 1845, there was a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
This is the solution, demography, inequality, environmental sustainability, security and economical development, the ability to create knowledge, important to all the greatest questions that made the human gender.
And the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can stay in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse, that there are few richer, people from all over the world, people call socks other people who also ignore me the most famous calling.
And stage frighting is creativity: this is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink.
Then, here's my idea, that the city, in the end, is used and in some way adjusted as a solution, creativity is this ability to imagine in the city.
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition no longer is the foundation city to solve the greatest issues of humanity, because as a birthday scat: mass and people, we are all used to confront this other city for thehabitants, for the vast, for the GDP, a product.
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, with such individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status.
Because, perhaps in this moment, after a thousand years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Or others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that in this moment or in some periods?
You begin to be...
This virtuous mechanism, and then we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to move from mechanisms of urban phenomenon to mechanisms and tools that develop development and give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and who are not afraid of the urban phenomenon, but who is trying to feed this mechanism.
A group of green, unknown in the center of the city, ten minutes per meter, from Man, with utopia and courage, and this is an image from the top of the city, of the satellite, and some pairs were evident, not all of them, but sparking the basis: the first example is Milion.
That was my idea together.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
to name this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city, like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 km of green, a vital stage, you can imagine as an element of diversity and strength.
Creating in the positive things of the systems we live in, not allowing us to fight against the newspapers of traffic, which is still invoking, before the absence of solution, of cities like natives.
It comes to the cement.
The second example is now that of a city - I don't know if you all remember these retirements - I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires, Argentina, the capital, more than in other countries is the building of all the nation, the place where everyone takes a chance, but this mechanism, which is the definition of city that I've proposed a few years ago.
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation what was it?
Do you eat alone?
The ability to limit development, and instead of courage, shaping up, with the same ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, which are the cities.
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies: three strategies that accelerate development.
Most infrastructure and the creation of spaces, pedestals, or wages, you can see this ...
It's density, the piano grows in 2030 we shouldn't limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, in the poorest neighborhoods.
Changing the population not only of the aggentine but from all over the world and the creative people to get together, and then build a system of infrastrutture.
Also, suffering allows us to increasingly believe in this development and to accelerate them, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
From green and pedonal spaces, and these three strategies together focused on the development of Buenos Aires, we realized that cities are the solution to everyone in the world.
Ancorates a time.
Atterrete.
And maybe choosing the position at the end, you will see it from the upset, this great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe...
You're proud to live in what I call the city section, thank you. (Applause) Thank you.
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause)
The words are important.
They put us in ideation.
It wasn't our thoughts.
The words of our language.
They are extraordinary, they are vocative that are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion.
I'm a son.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And you see beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about it.
The English idea: provincial and emotional mixing, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago ...
They started to become common.
But did he contribute to a little longer?
And will I start to show you?
Some negative twists.
There are many rats on their insecutions and the largest universities in the world, and they show them with a great argument: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana, in Ja, and in Euncia.
In Seden, in the leg united to the Kiss College of Ronda and the Middle Oxford.
Chicago, the United States, Harvard, says "gotten" in his insurance, not just universities.
Honestly.
Dichiarian, if you were in Latin "Eh".
Londra has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
Kinsland, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: the American Marina says, "Sempen lastelli, if you've always heard of it in film, the British marine speaks in Latin, and there's no instruction to be transatist like NASA."
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
(Audience) Wow!
Well, have you seen it?
On the other hand, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality?
And this ... (Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we have to say, "Room, me and you, or a beggar," what is this sheltering of ugly lega?
What is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each of us: "They're with the five pallets high" (Laughter) (Applause)
And one is asked.
But why, but because at the moment that I take, if we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there's no one who makes the insensite thing to settle their name.
I was promising.
It's no part of it.
Just Doma.
"Daddy, dad, you have your penetration."
Let's take a look at the total turning point (Applause) A lightened rhythm.
The Ministry of Benicuto will see it beautiful.
Risconta?
(Laughter) "No, it's not really nice to see, Beautiful," "So we're Italian English in an insensite way..." (Laughter) "I don't like the aglophons, that's it."
It's curious, it's this one.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
Stoized in Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguists, in habits.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses, study, or because they love it.
For the pool, for the opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
I know what I did.
We are talking about the language of angels.
(Laughter) Second, it feels male.
Nevertheless.
For example, pizza?
It achieved the world continuing to call us pizza.
(Laughter) Here you see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map that sell 'amburgers' or 'hotdox', comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And she says "Pizza."
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
(Audience) Yes!
Keat here: we eat food, we drink wai in Lucca, there's nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote the week of Italian wine, they'd say, (Laughter) because the ristors of New York...
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
Wow!
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food, let's talk about fashion.
This is what is written by the Italian River's paper: the look "corrifrendli," more "blem," directly by the passports of the "fow inter."
(Laughter) Okay, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones once.
Please stand up and ask you who has told me.
(Laughter)
Hunger rings, as if it were a mountain road in Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
Like they are at our Devenery.
And the women we see in our mental births.
Why, "you"?
(Laughter) But be honest, there are no strings.
Let's talk about publicity, old, advertising, anywhere, this one ...
It's the publicity of a vecture of not in Spain and speaking, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment of breastfeeding medals in France and reading it.
It's French.
(Laughter) This is the same payment in Italy and it spoke English: there are only two Italian words: the first ... (Applause)
What's happening to us, if we perfectly swallowed ... (Laughter) says, "Let's go back to our radars we call ourselves?"
The Argentinians say, "I'm on the Internet."
Riolniance.
She says it sounds catital, isn't it?
We are certain, here's the curious thing, because more than two Italians don't like it's an English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) Well, let's hope that medical abilities of what it does.
It's compiled by the sign who has compiled this formula's model, as well as an advantage of linguistic competition.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are controversial.
We use a quantity of English words.
There's no one.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasion, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The nazzle is the "locker" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must give a shower of toothpastes uniting from the caste to be satisfied.
(Laughter) It's a joint with business.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pipo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the clicket service, because then the unite business is always "Pipofanco" and "Genale" (Applause)
It says "glese" and "mails" only talk about it in companies, but also in media, public administration.
The Govern.
We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset didn't have much fun.
And I've forced the newspapers in Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit like that.
In English, that there will be no more sympathetic, because it has an English name.
"Wow, that's it!
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman wedding?
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To make mining sensibility about this problem.
(Laughter) Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
And a little bit of energy: this appetition?
who invented it.
Public public records, the government, the companies, the media, say it, in Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it did, became protagonist of this sensitationalization company: did we expect?
A speech of failure, but not what happened: in less than a month they filmed, putting their name, a kid's, Dizzo's, and there are 70,000 people.
They signed young people, elderly, globey policies and people who didn't spike that the engineer has signed up supporting professionals and called pensioners, they signed Italian people to the west saying, "What does our language do and have signed History in Italy?"
To a movie is still the whole world.
From Singapore, from Jerus Jalem, it gives me "Peduda," "chuddish," "Dando d'Africa."
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
Open.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
I'd like to make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a twist, we are in the novel of flash, if we think abundantly, we talk about other tango scoritably, working in a public recording, helping.
Filmo, because I've studied Classic high school, but I've worked with economists, "A great Italian and an English descent, I'm the best of a stage, the English, Sisher, a fashion show, I've received a laughing at it, I don't believe there is."
(Laughter) And we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but Italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
(Laughter) So I started to let me talk about our language decence, because I would never like to say, "Senty Diaign and funnel that sped up the opportunity." (Applause)
For Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, in Paese, in Bianjaros, in Qata, I'm surprised to feel relatives who don't know how to speak about Table's bubbles, but reinforce the bottle of Company, but you do, and that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know how to explain (Laughter) (Applause)
That's why I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody would finally take these initiative to 85 years, thanks for engines.
Here, I said to you: an extraordinary transversal echo, because in mass communication, this thing dropped to zero cost, on the Internet.
The year amplified.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the storm of the Republica, but it was taken with great applause, also, in Italy and Turkey security.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vaniti fea talked about this.
He didn't talk about Christian family, he didn't talk about the flow of Turing, he's not talking about the fact that the director has made a family: a transversality, right?
"Ca!"
And that it's stone all the usual tree, also a little bit of coffee and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and put them to the most populated ones.
And many times, I'm the great wish to tune ourselves with the Portuguese and with consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional places, and it has also touched me put food and bear PLAG, it was interested in an Australian radio, a lion.
Well!
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracia, because it makes us understand a fact of reports.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, is a factor of your emotions.
We have to sell the spiral and bring it to the world, because it represents us, and know how crazy it is, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
To do better, and later it was said to Leonardo.
In the first of the interviews of the newspaper, the Eonaldo defined himself: "Here without lying."
that would scratch in flying, in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign and express one of our pecuriarities.
Delefletics!
The magnificent potential of our most Italian creativity, which has radicized in your mother language.
Even if our linguistic thesis is strong, used to this, we can approach some strange techniques, why personality?
But we have to put it inside a thesis that is not fully and straightened.
From lack of sex to excess.
To finish, or to evil, why do I say this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) What does it mean to be a young player?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens to you, if mom or dad or dad, started to feel bad if a child or a teenager still had the hardest idea of being a young age, like everyone was going to school, I'd be picked up with friends, but what's behind these photos that didn't see?
First of all, I would like to take a step back to you, to always start from the beginning.
And if I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love the channels, and I've changed my hair a certain point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then crossing it, but what is there to be invisible in those photos?
[A.DE.]
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
(Applause)
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sensations of harm, fear, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they end up again: the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
The difficulty to concentrate is also having to look at domestic facencies, as to do the thesis, or to hang around with hammeries, they're the nicest lines, or to talk to the doctors and to manage therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the burden behaviors that the togget may have, but in addition, it could lead to really and its emergencies, without anyone preparing to do it.
But how do we add all this?
We also had to keep doing the life of always, go to school, study, why I'm here today and that I'm adding another character, which is often not able to talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your good mother, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and determined to ereditate the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your mother have a shepherd disorder, a bipolar a schizophrenia, or if there's even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, mum, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect; even today, it's not perceived as a common good that belongs to all of us, and for you that if children, the doctor, they become even more heavy.
[Yes!]
The weather that perceives in the cloth, difficulties communicating inside and family, stigma, prejudice, craach, can lead you to have everything inside and not just say anything: how do I face the situation?
What was behind those photos that wasn't visible behind that smile, there was a crown that came to be automatically formed, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rab and tears, and to prevent me from getting rid of the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing the things of all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
Let's do it.
And you know why in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to try it, that there is no other person who has lived the same things we've lived, but the truth and that belongs to this person, who is part of the family, who has read it on the Internet, because of our children's stories didn't go out all different, all of them, but there's something that has impacted me in common.
But through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've tried and understand that were natural the reactions I've experienced, but I've also been able to see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
It's a huge desire that needs the help of everyone, because it's aligned, the encounter has been an owner, an huge owner, which gives me energy now, and it has been a moment of positive or powerful spelling, their view, but also the ability to transform that pain into seeds for a change, I've seen those positive characteristics of resilience from their own mirrors.
And it's a project that has gone from the bottom, thanks to both institutions, and it's called Crowd Famn, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room now, who have grown in this same desire, they gave us the challenge to start it, for their disturbs, they don't even know how to cure for their disturbs, or their mental disturbs.
Initially, when I thought about this project, I was in detail, I won't make it realised how it will do, that they have come but I asked people around me to the scursionist guides, proposing to tell during a floor in ten minutes the history, and now we managed to get to so many regions, from the dark wallet, we don't stop, we want to reach the others, and find people from the civil society, who wanted to become our positions in the change.
To those that are positive and negative emotions, the leaves of life, being disenged, even if it's too bad to save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
It's something I know.
And one of the positive characteristics that parents with mental disorder we have is willing to change their scope, and that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, thanks to you, let's learn together the door that was not open for us, let's get the light, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
Aron Sfarz, when they dedicated a documentary last year, last year in 2014 the year encouraged by the Internet on-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category: it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher; I'll surely play a hacker in a sense of sound.
It's an intellectual, a writer, it's easier but to make a list about the technology of projects he collaborated with, it's about ten decades.
(Laughter) Over 14 years ago, they were in a group that read the hers, maybe you don't say much, but it was ugly in the framework until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today the Creative Commons are around a part of content, they are free licenses, they believe the most flexible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something that's called a reddit, becomes a millionaire, from one day to another, with the target and open, because it would enormously limit the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What in the sand is absolutely overwhelming is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curiosity.
Aaronna told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 year old books: all the messages of the economy to the political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
(Laughter)
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge, in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn how to highly, he tells his mother that, at some point, she was scrolling, and aaron had two and a half years and was seduced in the segelone and the avenue on the fridge that she had just begun with the socks.
(Laughter) Iron achieves an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, his partner, who is the famous knowledge, wants to share knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
The access of information that we need to think a second is everywhere: we're in schools, libraries, the university; information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental point for banality, in other words, information can give access to information to people, that is to say, to compare a disabled person.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
The fact that Aron comes from the genius which he is, this comes from his cultural background, which is the one in theker, as in the other hand, not as a distress, when he knows the code and has the abilities to read it, and then modify it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
That's not the case.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
An access to this information, so if all institutions are made by people, so fundamentally they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
(Laughter) But you don't do this as you are: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become an erotic actor, but you become a collective building act.
(Yes)
None.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Hazes.
A great movement for open access to scientific literature, and Aaron is compassionate to this subject, scratch this thing called Open HX, Beerland Open Hands Manifesto, which is written between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
(Yes)
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
ASBAI has taken care of it, not a hacker of this genius, it's probably not observed, it understands that your opportunity to do that Aaron's ...
An example: they want to give you an example to show all hackers out of the world that the world doesn't change with a pair of code.
(Laughter) That's how aromine is made of a veracity and its maturity persecution, to have scared hundreds of thousands of artists of academic floats and could do it, but not in this scenario, it risks up to 35 years old, it spends millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first army, anon stood at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
(Laughter)
The point is that power knows it, that power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the contrary.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
(Video) (English) I think it's a father ... (Laughter) I'm a person ... (Laughter) (Laughter) I think it's an important thing.
But even now everyone goes through them.
(Laughter)
(Music music starts) (Music ends) The thing you speak is: (Laughter) I'm a very big person.
And what about it?
You've seen people with disabilities a bit, as you're doing to scaven, as you're doing to scalp your rows for carcking sping, in calcium, as you say.
And then, how do you do it?
Right?
In INESDAN Bellter Keenberg, in Brazilian, it's a Bellter Keen, in Strackers, in boys of boys of gold in Ander, and gold, and G, G.
[Inglese] Intervistor: Rispect an last year I liked, that's when I loved to finish the difficulty of elaborating a sign, right?
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two polarized internet prospectives, horrible Internet.
I wanted to end the same, I wanted to live in both, things that coexist in the same way: the Internet is too complex to be just one thing, because the Internet will always be that complicated thing.
I didn't share my friends because I don't have them, but with the words of someone braver, and in doing life, it's not something that will be: if there's one of them here, the hell that we live in every day, that we are living together.
Behind, there are two lines to not suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore, the second risky requires attention and learning continues, and make it last and give you space.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, well.
Well, then, if life had appeared, there were older people in our Sun, the oldest ones with 13 billion years, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half, good evening everybody, so in 1950 that on Earth could appear, in the galaxy, as a species, very approached to answer this question, but the simplest thing is that there is no one elsewhere, and asking where there are all of them, and we didn't talk about other commands.
I think this is a question that we asked all of us, before or before, when I was a child, I watched a rolled sky, and I asked myself if, around those bright spots that could be planets, that, maybe, at that moment, were looking at my directation, outside the earth, it would be an epocal change for our species, even the place we took in the universe.
For so many centuries, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the Universe, maybe even more than the other two.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps forward in the vocation of a possible answer, not yet we have it, an answer, but we are the first human beings to be carried.
And from the penets we know, in reality, we also know that many of them are at the giant distance of their shelves to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so that of sea and oceans, that could say that it is indeed habitable, and even in a future, not too far away, we could say that in this light that there are, in these planets, one of these planets.
Actually, dancing from the Sun is a huge speed, with seven kilometers in the second, so a huge speed, but I think, how much we'd put this space probe to reach the closest to our lives at the moment of the gender, because I really believe it would be a epocal change for all of us.
And then, here is one of the things you have now, when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of ferment that later the interrogative in reality that we all have, which are all how many: the first forms of life involve a cellular, an antennae, and saying, of all very complicated, maybe we are not alone in the universe, and so the other stelle are incredibly farther away of life.
At the dust of the hand to the side, there is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complied by a life of billions of cells, the animals, the activities, the dinosaurs appear here at the end of the palm of the left hand.
And at the beginning of the last speech, a natural catastrophic event, very likely to the impact of a great asteroid, the space between the Earth and three quarters of living species at that moment on the planet, and this type of pictures.
And this has already happened, because today we know that for decades of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like neanderthal, and therefore, we should not necessarily bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, and that we should never have to bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens.
And then, maybe there's a little the key of all as if one day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will treat microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be rare, and even their experience could be brave, incurable, compared to the times of the universe, maybe the same intelligent species, once completed a certain technological progress level, to become authentic, or simply, to be involved with the audience, they disappear.
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine if we're seen from the universe, no one would ever realize that we've been.
We are a very young species, just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate through radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we reached the confines of the solar system, but, at least, in part, the opportunity to change, to influence our destination.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key, of these free intelligences is to survive the highest possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space, then I think that even more we have the need to keep access until we get this wonderful park in case in a small planet that is lost in the middle of the cosmos, thanks to it.
(Music)
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport of victory, not from the sport of those who came first, of classifies, but from the fact that sports creates positivity and positive things for others.
The strength to move forward, the strength you think will give us the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 km, which later became 100 segments, and agreed two, because there are 49 few, no, not even adding two of them, because the seventh is an important number, and you know, it's a number that will come back in more times, long this story.
All the participants that instead of running, instead of being worried about coming the first, or coming in the last few, all of us came together, after these 16 hours of travel, are quite agonymous Chileans.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
(Suppy)
This is the first cover, the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 kilometers all of us, we do them during our performance, but the desert is general, the rope is a bit like the metaphor of life.
Later, during life, imprevists happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, or if it's time, or if it's to do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the opportunity to react, and I had the first difficulty to have after three kilometers.
(Laughter) And many things seemed to me, "Wow, let's do it..." Okay, I'm a bit pronounced to people, I've cried the kitchen" (Laughter) (Sigh) I never live.
Actually, I couldn't really get involved, because at this station was associated with an important thing in Foundisinga, an important initiative to collect money from the lower against the Roblastoma and a infant tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, I before this experience, I hadn't met many many many of them, who, in this moment, are male.
The desert of Namibia is the desert I chose because the flag, then it split from the other side, and as it touches the sky, because, inside the desert, it's not only the cellulare, I've had various problems, it has the braces of witness, it's a warm, and there's nothing dramatic, but, unfortunately, it was a cover that started to make me think of a cover that started to think of a cover that started a string of corse of corse, but also with a corner of salsa, it's almost a bit of salsa, and it's almost a bit of a warm, we feel a bit of a bit of a bit of it, and we feel a bit of a bit of it,
(Laughter) We are already in Mexico City, which is also the highest grade in the world, here in Namibia, and I've done it now.
(Sings 'Pierre Bacco') Vabbai, I didn't get it. [Inglese] I have two other Chileans when I do two other things, (Inglese) It's not normal, and I went by, my putails, and I was given a lot of thanks to all those who are giving you strength.
And I found in the desert, even when this morning I was talking about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, other than 26 people, because they were a very happy girl, 96.
And so, this is us because the organization that had made a Chile far away from the front had given me the gear to give me the opportunity to come, to finish the uffician cabin, then return back, and take the other Chileum to go back, to reach 1006.
Because the project had the opposite idea, to reach these "no" Chileans, it's really inside, in numbers you, always, important and recurrent, the interesting thing is that we arrived at the end, and the moneycut, 206 km, or 100x2.
But I wasn't like this: well, I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all of them, don't worry, you can also run away, I was just like this, maybe a little more.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke ...
When I had a captain, people had thought, and I was surely 100 meters away and I was already tired:
I wasn't alone... (Applause) (Cheers)
Otherwise, besides having a wife that's enough, I had two children, a little bigger, and Riccardo, who's already 10 to 7 years old, and the other Pietro, who was 6 years old, and nothing, Riccardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first elementary.
It's a bit like the race, the one you know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
AC: This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating emorecity, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of high school, and this celebrating hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malformation that we didn't know during birth, and it lasted hardly, and this is the last time I saw it smiling.
When I looked ... (Sigh)
(Laughter) Okay, and so, when it seemed that everything was going well, February 18th, 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too close.
Surely not the garage is called Taranna, 116 Pitro, you've understood the number.
But in these moments, I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
(Audience) Yes!
And give the chance to the other two that arrived: it arrived to Emma, it's never arrived on the 29th of July to San Pietro, but you have to continue (Applause) but you have to keep on trying to go on with the strength that is limited, because remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed.
(Audience) Yes!
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, so I had to be myself, stronger, so I had to do that what to manage to create or improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people the strength.
I ended up arriving in Namibia desert, where these 16 kilometers have brought me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you see there the perfection, which I wanted to take 21200 euros.
And I'll continue to run by myself, which is 222, because I haven't only run from the desert.
And this year in November went to the Omann desert and Chileans will be 165 so I got only water, we came here, we waited to get to the end, but the desert is diverse, but the opposite is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them to do better.
It's all the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always there have hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward (Applause) And today we are here.
And today, it's 17th of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everything. (Applause)
