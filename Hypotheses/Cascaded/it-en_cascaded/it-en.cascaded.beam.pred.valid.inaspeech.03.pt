In 2016, I was given a reward, from the out of a blind linguistic force, unfortunately, it's not always easy: the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the context of the students, and my ability to create environments of less formal and more resilient data, let's imagine that this is a classical music.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a methodology that uses end of quantity.
Storietelling.
(Laughter) In the pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to transmit knowledge to the students, and with this method I would like to start my lesson, explaining a topic about everyone's mouth, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories I tell about in children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
Second World War: 1942, UK.
Blece and Park, a residence northern Londra.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a special and enigma machine.
It was a machine to write.
The operators were digitally outdated, but older than spliting on a paper, those letters are stamped out other letters, according to a code which is powered basically under the machine, those letters, which are stamped out other letters, according to a code, which is powered dramatically from them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main characters in Blece Park, with his team and built a machine.
What can you see?
I say, in order to decipher these tests written by youredes.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article on the Manda magazine: computer and learning machine, where Thuing test proposes.
But the question behind testing is a very accurate.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
[A.DE.]
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be another person?
The waste is to use a computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a "o" operator.
[Yes!]
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
It is said that the vehicle starts to overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers came from the vehicle and when the answers came from the worker: this is the limiting game.
But the machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome testing, must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to formulate the answers, must in an automatic way to form these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
G.G.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence, one of these is cognitive approach.
(Laughter) It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they drop.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it says that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues, according to this approach, the assignment that if we can have a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
From these two premature premises, it is due to a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the understanding of the logic of the thought, from here the logic of dots and transferred to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people, an entity.
(Laughter) Do you act?
It must be adapted to this.
And you have to set goals, and know how to bring them to the end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote, can a machine to think.
A artificial people.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities, your phone is an integrity.
Through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, like psychological construction, once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
This is what is trying to build artificial and intelligent and supported by humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see today: we have dormant actors, human beings, human beings, I would like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence based on their abilities, if machines can think.
Human beings have the optimal actors.
I want to share with you some example: optimal agents are the agents that solve the Rubik cube, already with four strengths in the best way, joke a sadness, think that a few years ago a child has resolved the start of the Rubik cube, which has resolved it in 4.73 seconds.
But do we have Sovans' agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, in the game of the scats, in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, Gasporn Rampion has been killed by artificial people, we have human rights, which are almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answering questions.
We use "para" or "maning".
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example, in cognitive activities such as cultural words, or the image classification, and there are underworld people who suffer from all kinds of people, examples are the element classification.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today aren't able to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge.
How is it?
A few years ago, in America, this song was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence in the world; today, it's the highest limitations of artificial intelligence by which we think we're far from overcoming the test, it could make machines think: mine.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a facial line that indicates intelligence with a exponential call: this equipment follows the predicted apartment in the wall, for which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radioppy years and in quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
I use this computational compassion to stimulate the human brain: I didn't have seen anything; in 2020 we'll have access to a thousand dollar to this computational capacity.
(Laughter) In 2025, according to racial and key hours, but we can never be able to balance in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
(Laughter)
And then, in 2045 and theind moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
(Laughter) In his articulum.
According to mind rivers, Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against her same test, these observations are our observations against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, following a course of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, taken by the Gaitano professor in Lanzerone ear, against artificial intelligence.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine that is ethical and stupidity, I want to describe it in simple ends, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, a symbol of sound by the side without the evolution.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine, and that becomes more intelligent than us?
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story, relating to the start question, machines may think, "Let's start with an open question."
(Audience): Yes.
It really makes sense to let them think.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) How many of you today have spoken about photos?
Craziness.
OK, OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I call the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his own phone, which doesn't take me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but which sense can have, try to understand the weapon photographs, change the processes through which we communicate, but there are many others.
With professionals, instead, that for the first ten years already, opened the challenge of this new medium, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal elections, the experts of their experiments sharing images through the cellulare.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
at the DESC of the photo editors of New York Times Magazing, that scattered.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In the sale of Parifoto, one of the most prestigious photos in the world, to enter those places where photography is distributed, is sold, is put in account, and to understand how mobile photographs change these ingranajes.
To find answers, I tried to look further, beyond the surface of the big places that are visually visible in contemporary.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to be involved simply in a worldwide narcissistic delirium, like some sociologists supported with the basis occupational of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as an avocation of section, as an identified stream, as a so-called variation of its imagination.
Or the Ash Lagger, is the land of the answers, and from this phenomenon I tried to give an interpretation in a book called "I Revolution," given for a story of mobile photographs, because beside the floor of images we wounded, it seemed useful to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective gathering, if you want, that has impressive numbers, every two minutes today we can see more images of how much human beings have scaven in the interaction of this century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and diffusion of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a retirement close to some professionals, became an extent of linking our daily experience.
A way of social interaction, a can of proof of our face in the public dimension, where we define ourselves through images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that was strongly remarked by the process of referring them daily, the fluid of photographic mobility seems the way natural expressions, a fluid vision that is composed by compounds.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event, with their cell phone.
That the void stays with the professional photographer and the difference goes between Western photos and conscious photos.
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
Speaking in account of that process of democratization of photography, I started with theera Kodak and arrived at the iPhone.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
For one part, opening up to everyone, to all of us, from a dialogue festival, with a potentially global initiative, has released the professional photographer of his sponsor as a photographer.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think of the role of the Photography and social network in the front Arab Spring, showing that it is a powerful tool to guide public opening and capture a source of devices and information hardly controlable of the regions, this is a expensive image to the center of the Mobile photographer on the other hand, but.
Think about the possibility of interaction is directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographer and audience, I free it from imposibility to reach the destinations of its message, if not through traditional fields, such as information, journal, and galleries, of access and limited resources.
And he allowed them to directly put themselves in the right of News, creating visual content in real time, an example particularly interesting.
Like, for example, you're pictures, an Instagram accountant, founded by an American photograph, "Seccort Courniz," and devoted to conservation of the universal heritage of family photography, in the midst of my photography and society, in the 90s, or new paths of preservation of icomobile memory.
We traveled by corporational section, as the Ctories, which means we are professional and non-negrographers, and has an accurate to select of those with an impairment logic, journalism and narrative, around a topic, but then, the photos in the last years have operated this tool with a highly consciousness of authority.
Benjamin Lowi.
Now, a life that has used and use smartphone in conflict territories, showing that agility and discretion can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic meteors that, starting with a simple smartphone, exploded new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Fidanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and has made an intimate narraction process and minimal over the major basketball games.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempted Community to the partners around his job.
Let's use it daily to build its family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
Peter from Campo, who, through the Everest African Convention, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African Africa, along with media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame, showed how mobile phones.
They are Stephan of the Luis, who has reinterpreted the God's seed with the cellulare, telling in the IV series, one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history, with the most new vision tool.
Or as anastasis the Lord Lind, who has photographed his successive manifesters in the sink, who is during the proteste of Mai Dan, with an old puzzled bronic, and contemporary has registered his own cellulating the moment in which the anotor of the Bronics hits and is born in the image, translating a photographic experience in bilk, logical and digital, far away, long and contemporary stream.
Well, what do these photos know how to do, that we don't know how to do everything?
To keep going to the outskirts of the action, or looking for the vision of many personal vision of the evolution, avoiding more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creatively the code of storytelling, designing in a profound and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world and the quality of impact.
Because if anybody is the pregnant recovery tool, only if the photographic impairment is smiled by a solitary, articulated in a poherent manner.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
All of this I believe still makes the difference between a photograph that was reinforced in real life, with its reproductive bubble, its self-referent and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
The first one.
It doesn't exist.
So also in this room, those employees, these signs, and put them home after a really stressful job magazine.
Even better, you compete with your partner, in case, and then you'll get up on your bedside in your bedera and think of being on its own, and instead not.
And there's always the law, this frequency of 50 Hert, that I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
Now we have a positive side, or even better, I leave first from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We are never alone, in other words, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us: beautiful, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/30, isn't more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents divorced when I was little, and I know it, you think that this is the classic strappalous story, but no, it was the revelation of my life, so each supplement of dying was no longer.
A classic complements of roots, fert, immobile, cousin of voice, but becomes my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
Of course, I said, at some point, I tried to become a normal person, trying to say.
So I started to study crying.
It's the pianoforte.
Later I liked Woody Allen, so he managed to resonate with the Clarinetto, the problem was that Arenzo Arbore really loves, that there was a strictly ambiguous song, and there it was my first years of studio in genius.
But I also dropped Clarinetto.
Just like this, to dare ...
My classmates are easy to illustrate.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spontaneous sounds in a way, and I like to disagree with the problems of life.
All of us have attached a rumor, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow in much more.
I have a smile.
So here is my mission.
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
I cried?
I'd love poetry, right?
I'm going to make a great turn of dollar, kidneys, and it's all going to be conclusive, but no, I've got complicated this way of life.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
That's the study, and with the study, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion: our inner eye, the catalogue of the musicians, our team, reaches the maximum functional around twenty minutes of gestation.
Thirty weeks of gestation, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching, and this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
To what speteral in life, once born, it must be ready to sound texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, not in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child, once he is born, will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistols, so the mother is pregnant, and it's a reform that I give you personally attention to the musical choice, attention to the work, more than anything else, OK?
(Applause) But the sound is everything that we are surrounded by, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
But the column is now in every magazine, the journalist in our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom keeps us, and not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
There's more small than what, more small, of the Militarian man.
in a small town in San Pietro.
You, your smallest house, you, maybe?
A.R.
It captures the same thing, as when someone saw me in video, I watched the stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me, "But I imagined high, well, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible, so?"
Through this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's dream of imagining our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe, then we're in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, it's not the case, and we started taking photos of the feet, the wisdom, then the election, Chileans don't exist, I lost my story, but it's a multicannel, a multisensorial one, but at some point, who has it.
Food, well!
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
And we keep it.
We make a lot of video, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to stay in silence, that silence that between the other doesn't exist: there are two.
Listen.
To listen and to.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, would I like to take you with me?
Right to the world, hooing it.
This is your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you ...
The dream of my life, the dream of my life, born from school.
In my own.
It was in 2013, I wanted to go far away from school for the first time the school of myself, a series of failures, problems and others.
Then I turned into harmony, but I sponsored to find a far away place from the adventure, here, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I wrote the plant: yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, I chose an artistic residence, and the most beautiful years of my life started by simply listening to me for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only growing, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of all over the world, of all the cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this Sound of City project.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where for 48 hours I didn't stop recording the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a sound column.
So, in this moment ...
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography differently, and you've become more than once, but that smoke that fits tombs that fell, but the Bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that defines it.
Everything is completely in the leg.
and the desire to resonate with others.
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
In this photo ...
The drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sons gave me the data of these children, that in this iron pipe, portable, have given me this helpful camp.
And I make you feel, first to the Greek internship, and then, it is working.
Then, that's the lab.
Then I say, "No.
Grandes, go to the span of... (Audience) Grandes.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
Have you ever stopped?
It's in the lab.
OK Genova is "Mr. Zandis" (Laughter) Well, it wasn't a fight, it's one thing would be, anyway.
The writer, which you can see so easily in the Ferrari' desk, is not just a writer, but to me it's a great musical instrument, and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
Well, the last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
The cheap of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I immersed it for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me particularly a frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has transformed into what is the porting voice of the sound colony.
This is the rock sound.
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
(Laughter) What's the sound of our passions in my and in your lives, and how many people will tell you they're rumors, they're out of time, and they're always worth listening to them, and I'll give you back to school, thank you!
As Guy Beck says, in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea of the idea of the restitution linked to monetary restitution, to benefit, very often, but the restitution is linked to restitution what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say: nothing works, then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post a 18 minutes shared some of this story.
Most of them were extraordinary for Redesi or Segrate, it was a very heavy activity with many parents, but some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the State of the Moon," but most of them were extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community, we picked up a billion 200,000 readings, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro from then, and it was a trick of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similarly, the same school at the next school is active, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
That is the "giveback" of reproduction is quite normal.
I've said this the concept of restitution, I've had the fortune, I've got the chance to go to school, to the university, to the museum, to the the theaters, there are all the communities that can afford to restitution of volunteers, not that the American society is perfect, everything.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker, Pramp is performing very actively by asking "Systemy is from the moment." Obama, famous 'Banacchia' and there was an incredible technological debt.
They build a study that doesn't work so many millions of situations, and this is the standard answer they got, soon, criteria doesn't end up for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is extraordinary, technological advancement, has a sense of 100 million dollar, so they don't care about these things that only succeed in Italy, it's not a common thing.
Audience: Yes.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Probably, many of you would have criticized: Google, surely, with its own interests in this, reconfigure the technological profits that were sent by Google, the other companies, there are fert and agree with the white house, have recharge, recharge, put in functions the site, stay in a few weeks, in a third of the costs.
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, since I finished the TAMEG discovery without being very interesting, is what I want to explain to you about what was spilled, I spilled by people who have even learned a lot about their lives, and experiences that in this case...
So these are the models that are part of this baggage, that we need to use, we want to rest: I want to suffer with the word models, keep the ability to manage major technological systems, complex processes, renewable, rejected, but also in Italy.
Many years ago, the idea of going back to help was also because they're Italian and...
From the World of Risno Trai, I just wanted to do it: to do or not do it, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do it, there is not only to criticize.
(Audience): Yes!
In general, in those things we have become a little bit less, a few years later, we have five to meeting "materence without Francesco," and Avenue measures Bisica, Silicon Valley, sensitive necessities of transformation in general.
Something that must also happen for the transformation of the processes, for the digital transformation of public recording public, asks me, because it's not about helping education for a couple of years: I think, it has been reflected, the length with my wife, Monica, and talking to my master's, Jer Beve, the choice was made and so it's been named Rome for two years.
A welcome...
Ah, manzone.
But those who do it as an Amazon, a robot, you know, but from something you'll underwater, these are only many slums, I must say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but at the positive side there was, I've been, I'd mentally focused on Oceticism and bureaucracy, but I'll take it out of these errocrazia, and, of course, I didn't expect, obviously.
But authenticism is not often about sexism, that you throw you a certain mentality, you never change it, obviously you do it because you have your bosses, I feel many of this kind, in this country, in truth, there is a lot of common sense, to do things because you don't care.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, as it is an extraordinary commissioner, simply because it's the route that led me to root, in this way we want to stop transforming them with people who are out of the outside, where the fact is not too small, too small, of technological expectations, around the time for those technological experiences, around the time I had done when I invite you.
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing here, in the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that closed photography of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given their phone children, in all the United States, in this massive sport, in terms of investments and infrastructure?
(Laughter) We've created the vision that the country's operative system, a series of fundamental components that can build basic and efficient facilities for citizens, publication is a beautiful documentation, it's lacrime and blood.
I've continued my postcard in salt, but it's the American future, if I don't agree.
And I continued, there will also be many rules, complicated, unbelievable, and it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of you will say, not knowing how the public record works, we've already talked about many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And still, we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be truly useful, others will be kinds and prejudices, the critics of the first type riding from people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution, and we treat many of them, those of the second type that are the animal always a flight.
Or that's the simplest part of the impotenment, and that's our problem: to reconnect to the things that don't work.
[A.DE.]
Do you remember this picture: the first, the men and women in the Times magazine cover?
Here's the thing: so, although he tried to memorize as much as possible people among collars, I got around 3,000 questions, which, of course, at least a hundreds of them qualified, we used digital tours for collochi, an app that's called Jazz, we put it online on the Govern Sea Sea, we did a math test and a terk on the Internet.
(Laughter) In fact, we're talking about hydraulics.
These are the tubes of public recording, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should have to interconnect is silos that they don't know.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machin, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their own suffering, their own applications, so it's about introducing this, writing it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability, and sponsoring the code.
But we can't also have the choice: to make the flames in time, we have to make them improve the authentic interface, doing more simple things, all these things are made in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the breast.
(Audience) Yes!
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we said, "The Spanish piano, public administration, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in my situation, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the trienial piano, pressing againstiths, technicians, technological technological ones they understand, and it appreciates other things in the ministers, so the traditional piano requires a team game, maybe three points of view, and of connections, from other levels of regulation, and at some point, the technological rules are quite incompatible.
(Laughter) Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the population platforms, the digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in spontaneously all the activities of the recording public, and the more they will be.
Digital payment is one: Digital payment, electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
Let's do this, technologically all the data of your citizens that at this time are about 8,000 different silences, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the one withabase, synchronize, where data is talked about them, especially those posts, I should say, all those things that I've already had to know.
Two weeks - a week ago we've made a Seria Akaton, all this concluded that we're talking about sustainability and replicability of the void for spunte Italy, I call T, where I'm woven, all documentary, and all the code, but each time more, the apps of the Italian public recording public, now they're helping us the technological perspective, as far from the other: the future is today we dream a little like this.
I was also working on other projects that basically don't get limited to make an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it's true that kids are composed, let me disappoint you, this might be, for example, one of those things that would have to grow in an alsa version, alpha, or a digital citizenship, the phone, the smartphone, the digital identity, the data of public recording, with a little bit of: we're dreaming a little more, because work we do it really much, but it's due to this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer, fifteen years ago, the world that we expect, asked a lot of people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens, I took the chance to write an article I want to cite you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing them and fighting them, they're the regulation in not ejecution.
But a country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, hoping to embrace it.
A country wants to offer technological competitions that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine up to a country where to work for public administration is an owner, where the Human beings migrate to work in public research centers that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation that leads development to the country, to become a dream.
And that the components to do all this digital process policies, technological processes are really many and maybe too many, but if they don't have a dream to punish hardly, they can do things.
To conclude, this is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Hey, let's do it." (Laughter) And it served somewhere in this theater among others.
And she also thinks it like us, like the slums, like the 25 kids of the Digital Times, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our dream is our social, thanks.
And what if I had the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
(Laughter) And I was sure that I'd all be imprisoned, or maybe win my muscles, more times, during my life, I asked myself this question, and the answer would be different because the students would have felt the most complex professors, they all seemed like, and they reflected in music, here the great voices to come in the test, then raise the hand that would change work, but I became a psychologist.
But I financed my research also to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
The strategy, today, the broadcast, is to get lamented, we're lamenting a little bit of everything, we're lamenting a little bit of everything, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, that makes fun, that I'd have done it differently, we'll regret it because there's no injustice, this nostalization, and it's starting to buy the homeland.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything that was to get bothered, from when I started to talk, and then the girl with whom he translated her, so the fact that she didn't have a job, a capability, and here the mind had completely colonized all their daily life, but lamenting for all of us, it was a little helping.
But beware, you can lift at night or at day, at high voice or in your mind, you can lift away from something that's already happened or from something that maybe a Sunday could happen, but the truth is that as much you will feel like lying up at night or at day, you will be able to lie down to what bothers you.
Another very exciting strategy, when things don't go like driving, is that of lamenting, assuming that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair, in the fence of the magnifying glass.
(Laughter) In the basis of this mentality there is a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't okay is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being, what surrounds us, doesn't you like bearing?
But it's a small ethical rule.
(Laughter) You felt a bit like that, but because you're never in suffering, you take two pillars and solve it easy.
Your wife breaks you with strength.
Allowly, let's take a look at how much rising it is: your child doesn't listen to you, not to you.
And it's too big that we couldn't lead it to the psychologist. We're here, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, to make the world around you put up with the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I didn't do anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to ease the waves of their future.
And he says: "Yes."
It's certain that, to conceive you, but not even to get involved in the kinds, and then it's a classicone, and it's not, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you, and it doesn't, you don't know you're not realizing all the things I do for you, that always starts with the same streamed word.
Everything.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that, if we say this thing often in good feet, believing deeply, we can hardly change something, but, instead of having to remove this odds at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigating them, to apply them, if the strategy they privilege.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there's no way a tool to take the forehead, put it under the ground.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
(Laughter)
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of altruistic needs.
I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went through the roof that the time was openly locked in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other, in this limited situation, with the important things, for example, it was learned.
But by listening, accepting, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, I never learned to say no to the things they didn't like, I didn't learn to say no to the things they didn't care about, and the need to count to you how many.
If the strategy that privileges, when things are not like going to happen, it's that of suffering your needs, first or then your body will start to talk to you and instead of containing all of you, you will end up finding them.
(Laughter) Sading, involving your needs or hanging them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in the middle of my meditation, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, primary school in the company I was working on, sent me to call and said, "But Zuccelli, here, for her, there's no more space, and she showed me a far away place, hopefully to go there to do a job, and there was no big deal with all that I had studied until then."
(Laughter) I followed to die, okay, but I didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adoptors, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing oneself, if I changed it?
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
If I became a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, my primary school wouldn't have sent me a way, maybe I would have gone away, I even saw that imitating it, but if I wasn't that person yet, it wouldn't harm me more than that.
But the answer wasn't in the harassment of others, but I had to ask my reflection of my responsibility.
But why are things?
They don't change.
But we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
And choose the places as a cause of things that don't go as a path.
Receive yourself as a cause of things that are not going to happen.
This is our challenge.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll never find myself alone and help face something much bigger: I mean, you open your doors in front of you, because you defend your responsibility, the gend, you can decide, it's the side of the crisis, what you want to do, but if instead of you, and you think of being perfect, that maybe there's a margin of change, that improves, then you open doors in front of a doctor.
(Laughter) Because life is the one who does it.
Who doesn't harvest it?
(Laughter) If inside the coppy, things don't go well, do you think there's the other side to where to take the first step?
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question is sending you a message of inadequity and you're spontaneously.
What can I do today to make your best newspaper, then things change, but they don't change in the case, but they change because you know you've changed, before you go to the research of your books?
Now, you see the search of your needs and then try to operate to satisfy them, and in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of the other person instead of making the war if you are one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me leave the end, the national prostitution, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something else, inside which you can become a role model of the game, and start working on me, considering being a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes pressure, to bring great value to their lives.
(Laughter) But my friends, I came across a couple of problems: stereotypes, prejudices, exposure to the doctor's doctor, but had to talk to a friend, but I went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
But I had to get lamented or possible that I didn't explain how many good psychology I had to give up my dream: no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was not academic, as closer to the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs, instead of implying mine.
It's the turn of ...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I hope what to do?
I thought about it, and in the end I decided I would have accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
(Laughter) I got to the case, I stood the computer, and I recorded a video that I've cartooned on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology in video, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting into discussion some of the stereotypes I've just bored you.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 1979, published psychology in Italy, my magazine, and what left me more than anything, was recognized that the schoolbacks, at the beginning, were able to isolate me.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had some sense, and in Lumbium I was read to the vice president of the psychological pattern: the dreams.
Don't become real because, if you were lucky, why did you get that chance?
The theory that you should have is the one that keeps you hold and takes forward, those who don't know how to build and need to distrugle, because the culprit should do it.
Well, if there's something I've learned from all my journey to improve.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
[A.DE.]
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For this reason, I've asked you a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life, what you would change, we've talked about the work, the physical aspect, the current narrative, that doesn't come as adults.
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least proveing, it's a small question that I personally was very useful and based on the logic that in order to produce great changes, it's about concentrating in many small actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, to tell you in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the direct?
It auspiciates.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions that are both?
See, you've got the keys of a frugier who now sends: "Fede, but where do you put the packs?"
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I made my hands, I knocked my leg.
Or on her feet, which is now about mutating?
Offite when I arrived to my mother, do you know what?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself, here.
I had a dream.
to create an integration band: percussions are so fast, so immediately, they accumulate distances and join the battles.
(Audience): Yes.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
(Laughter) Seven kids, I see them, eye, Laura, the fear of mine, I saw them grow, our provides were marriage, the mariday was the day of evidence, where they entered this room at the Andreoli music school.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters, were picking up the first bidonies, it was together, the first satisfaction of the young people, for us, for everything we were doing, we decided to make the first musical and via music brands.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012, the world was crossed, in the real sense of the word.
Tutts of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake we filled our land, and from that moment on, we were the thousands of earthquakes.
For all the gusts we called this.
But, as I said, the cases were no more accessible.
Many believe that our living provides, our place where all marriages were completely different.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do, me, Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, we focused on them all?
The endless cake and the rocks.
We got there: fortunately, we all found them.
We are all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of demonstrations, of thousands, inside that stone, came out of magnificent things.
And we've been feeling fearing stronger.
She looked at us in the eyes, with the Earth she washed, to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
Give it there?
We built the first tools.
The scenarios of sci-fi became advertising stairs, the tubophons that became...
The building and combined with ping pong roots, we were in a constant laundry, always, there was an incredible energy, even if we were in a terrible moment.
But that's where our first spettacol was born.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
So both the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we were, we turned 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man, at that moment, they all moved together as a white man.
And immediately after, we did the year later, we did the other spettacol, the curve.
We were all marineal, because we really wanted to navigate and also offer some time from our land.
To breathe for a moment, then last year, we did some crack, this marine monster, straight afterwards.
50 speakers, this flying sea, and to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
(Applause)
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought that a tone could change life, but we did it.
(Audience) Yes!
But I want to tell you one thing.
My last ones are finishing.
Well, everything we've done in these seven years really feels like a change.
(Audience): Yes.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first master?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
It's the kindergarten stage, and we really did so many.
And they also give me the hugs, because that's exactly what I'm talking about.
It's exactly the circumstances of life, that of fatigue, of sudden, but also of freshness, that has so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality, now I have to go back to the noise, they expect that there's still so much.
And to build, thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
It's been 250 years that have changed our history radically, and that we live nowadays, it's about social innovation, my name Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until I've been controlled that has happened in the last 250 years.
That's what we've been studying in the last 250 years, the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution, and the computer, so all of us, the industrial revolution, the internet revolution, and the phone, somehow, stored, arbitrary, in the 2000s, and a country ready to vapor.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what is, we use it, transport our voice, but it's also what permits us, the vapore mask is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to reveal our letters, and from the end to the vanilla that has developed the industry that has developed, not only two populations that have grown, but we couldn't try, but not only in the sea, but not only, and we knew, but not only on the cochon but also on the 127%.
Today, there is Rinascente Milano, a time in 1873 was built the first electric power plant, the first electric power plant, in that year, on December 30 was illuminated the scale.
But in these 50 years of the internet revolution has happened very little to the other, but they have been advancing and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, increasingly intelligent way, and they have become a contribution of intelligence, but it has begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the history before, and they simply had more raped the body, but at some point it is decided to open these letters.
And these responses, which were called arpae, arpanete, the network, became, they began to be, the World Web, which we know, a system diffused, orcular, non-chemical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information to gather information to generate information, were 25 million.
Not many.
And the functional strength started to strengthen the artificial intelligence of the computer we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the Internet, to equip data, to collect data or to develop data.
That's a industrial process that tells us that what's new, progressively, does what's old, because we've lived right now, that we're living right now, what's called the Internet, we've had the urge that, if little, we've started to live the urge we've lived now, proof of supporting them.
It contains that the 27th month of high school, when, little by little, the school, not even the Italian, was 1863, the Minister of Wingers put finances in Afghans as well as ran, the payment is public agencies.
