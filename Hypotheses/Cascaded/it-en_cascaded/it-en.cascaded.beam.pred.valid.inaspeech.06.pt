In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Forum Fortiching Learning, which was supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born rationally.
The motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient: Let's imagine that this is...
A big university class.
So when I go into class, I usually go into class.
The first ten minutes, when the students arrive.
Yes, you are.
Ietto with the ego my computer to analyze and use a classic music.
And I think this is the first step to create data environments, fewer disabled forms, and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
Well, during my lessons I use a method that is used by ananticity.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative.
To transmit the knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on everyone's shoes, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942.
Together.
Black Park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a young boy, thirty.
Alan Turing.
Alansey Laurea, here in the school of Cambridge.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, Nomeri.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator of tastes.
But, older than setting on a paper.
T touch, which letters stamp other letters, second.
A code imposed mechanically under the machine.
Bothedes used this mechanism.
To communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures to "black".
with his team.
And I built them a machine.
It's the one you can see.
Dietro, grado of...
Decide.
With these written tests by ITDESC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine?
And we make them form the concept of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
And in 1950.
It published an article on mind rivers.
computer and machine learning.
Dove proposes your test to you.
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
Are we familiar with one more person?
The stone is to use a computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a M machine.
It's an Oode operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the Mapa's machine exceeds that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome testing.
We must interpret natural language.
The question, who comes from person?
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches.
To study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they get there.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
We've heard about Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
Both premises.
Feritire.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detutive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
It's close to building deductive arts.
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people?
Initiality.
(Laughter) You must act.
It must be adapted to this.
You have to set goals.
And know how to bring them the terminals?
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects.
Riforming Turing's quote, a machine can think.
Let's say, can we make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
In this way, artificial intelligence has the aim of creating entity.
Artificialities: your phone is an entity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's close to building entities.
Artificialities are supported by man.
It's a cycle.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents, according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I'll explain to you with some examples.
Eight managers are the agents that benefit better than all men.
And you can't do me.
For example, agents that resolve the Rubik's cube play four in the best way, playing a sad, think that a few years ago a child has been rising.
I've been given the first part of the Rubik cube, and it's resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any months ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve the index, in 63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
that act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the camp is...
The face of scacks, shakes, landscapes, battled by artificial people.
We have the human rights actors.
Those that exist almost like all people, for example in the Pker Texano's game.
You'll ask for the acquisition question.
We have people online.
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
We are talking about the fridge.
How is it?
Mela.
What are we talking about?
It's the Marco of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world, in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
Let's go now in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
In America it was introduced to one thing.
The first technological name: Ray Kurzvalle, one of the greatest.
Arts of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate?
Now imagine.
A red line that indicates robot intelligence.
With a sponsocial call.
This is a sad moment.
The abandonment.
I'm preparing in the wallâ€™s law.
So ...
Computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, twelve years and in quadruplicate every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I don't need it.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then?
In 2045 and theindic is the moment when technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his articulum.
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing.
Not only did I proposed her test.
But it also proposes new observations.
Control his same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
He was a student at the University of Varese.
(Laughter) I was studying epistimology, deontology and ethics of computer science, including professor Gai Tano in Lanzerone Lanzerone.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the things we had to do was to propose an obectation.
According to Turing's test, against artificial intelligence, I was the only one who proposes...
One decim obeyed with mathematical communication.
The toney is stupidity.
Afterwards, I want to describe it in simple ends, let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people.
Tell the seed.
The symbol of the summit has the lead to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we keep going.
In an equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
Let's start with the first question.
I can use machines to think.
Now I'll encourage you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
But how many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
Okay.
Well, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I call the rivers, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his phone, which doesn't do absolutely for me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
His limits, his contradictions, his potentiality, his impact on the market, his designed and authorial use.
But what sense can have, trying to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here discussing it, this is just one of the questions I asked myself in these three years and that I want to share with you this story, but there are many others, how mobile photographs change the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider mobile photographs a new linguistic way of influencing the aspect of view than the forms of complication: technological consciousness that exists.
In the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer.
It still does the difference compared to the simple gesture of a smart phone.
And how do photographs change the forms and theestructure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to learn a confrontation.
With photographed, rappers, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflection.
I took photos of professionals who, for the first ones, already ten years ago, opened the challenge of this new middle.
I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the knowledge of their images shared by cellulating.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
At DESC of the photo and editor of New York Times Magazing, who would draw.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big communities, visited from contemporary.
selfie, for example.
The selfie is to simply belong to a global narcissistic disorder and to even consider it correlated, as some sociologists have written with the basis of the generation of millennials, or shouldn't be seen as a schedule.
Like an identified setting.
It was like a sound that reused his imagination, as it was playfully reviewed by the visa to the female artist like "Keitard Ben."
Look at Sholaga.
It's the financial term which has embedded and still secrets our vision of the mobile.
This is my channel, almost, victim, designed by my photographic experiments, it's simply the result of a world's epidemic to be happy.
Or, as sociologist Bornata has sustained in New Yorkenson, it can't be let to the police of more complex fators, of social, storic nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
Because it's called "I Revolution," joined in a history of mobile photographs, because in front of the floor of images we were wives to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that puts individuals into communication from one angle to another of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
Let's forget because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the man there.
In a contemporary, which is still very signed by the question process.
In certainties, as brilliant as the philosopher Zygmunt Pound.
It's as a typical of modernity, architecture, work, family, coppy, are increasingly increasingly increasing, and here the drawings are unstabilized in a universe in movement, spontaneous from the average of the messages that harvest them daily.
The phenomenon of the mobile photographs seems the most natural expression way.
A liquid vision that is composed and composed.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What is the only professional photographer left?
And what difference happens between Western photos and conscious photos?
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
taking into account the process of democratization of photography.
I started with the Kodak industry and it arrived until IFO.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's orchestra, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
He attacked the social functions, the position of the convention.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
Following for being.
A powerful tool to guide public operation is to capture a source of devices and information impossible to control the regions.
This is a picture of Cairo Pensiti, a show that the "Folfang of Assen" museum has dedicated the center of the photographer in the Summer Prime.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of E.
From the editor, he released it from the need to end up at a political agenda, to a detailed editorial line of others, and not always based on journalistic priorities.
I've liberated it from the impossible to reach the destination of its own message, if not through traditional channels, such as information, magazine, daily, cookies, access and limited resources.
And he allows them to directly put themselves in the ranking of News, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
We offered Time magazine in 2012, with Instagram coverage and directly put it into real time through T-E-COber's screening its own images, delinating a new model of Newsmking and I see journalism, reality in journalism.
This is the scale model that had originated after this experiment, and if it's true that in the radio, "Psat," we photograph compulsively, a quantity of pictures of hell ultra better than the one that we are able to remember, and it's true that in this same time, new paths of conservation of the global memory in which reading and photography and society in Novecent.
Or you are born men.
We traveled by corporational section, like 14-15 photographers, an international spacecase for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by two professional and non-normal photographs, and there is a job of scaling in accantinity, in narrative, regarding a topic.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Dengami Lowi.
Hi. Hi. Hi.V.
That have used and used smartphone in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the endeavor.
Photographic measures that, starting with a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for New Smadeking, creating a BayStrek platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Fidanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
Pread Mengin, who is the one used for sports photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, high-performance shops, and has made an intimate and minimal narration regarding the highest law.
Richarch Corte Ernandt, who tasted discourse and acknowledgement in the street, creating a personal beauty.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, creating an attempt and partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
The Peter of Campo, who, through the Everest Everi Count, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African African African, along with media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame, has also proved to put in question the stereotypes of photovoltaicism.
It's like the Luis that reinterpreted the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, storying in the IV TV series that I'm one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history with the most new vision tool.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who has shown his successive manifesters in the sink, who is, during the protests of Mai-Tan, with an old puzzled bronic, and currently has registered his cellulating the moment when the electronic designer blows up and is born in the image.
Well, what do these photos know how to do, that we don't know how to do?
To keep on walking down the outskirts of action, or trying to see many ideas that see many of them on top of the benches.
To learn more than to record.
Creating images that are never straight at the reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto.
Contaminate creatively the codes of storytelling, designing in a very big media, thinking and creating their own contents to be broadcast in diverse platform and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world's perspective.
And the quality of deep learning.
Anyone is the previous gathering tool.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a single, articulated in a puerent way.
You can distinguish yourself.
And from the background path that I find.
That's all I believe.
It's still a difference between photography, isn't it?
It's a real image.
Her bulimic, reproducing, her self-refidence and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
Half thirds have come into the mind.
In our quickly lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
An email.
It doesn't exist.
And so, in this room, those actors.
These flies.
And give it a frequency of 50 Hers.
Then you imagine, no, you go home after a job magazine that is really stressed.
You tag with your partner, with your partner, and then you will get to bed in your bedroom and think you're on your own.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
That I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
We have a positive side.
Or better, I start before the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive side.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
Great.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/30, isn't more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents?
They enjoyed when I was a child.
Well ...
I know it, you may think that this is the classic 'backyard' history, but instead, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness.
During those days, in the burden of that house, I started to play music with everything around you, so ...
Each complement of the net was no longer.
A classic complementary ofarredo, fert, immobile, cousin of voice.
But let me become my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
And I certainly say, at some point.
But it will become a normal person, I mean.
So I started studying yesterday.
It's the pianoforte.
I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to stop Clarinetto, the problem was that he liked an arbore plenty of an ambiguous channels, he was bringing it to the first years of studio in geno.
I also helped Clarinetto.
It's good then, to not go.
My failures, my classmates.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to sponsor it.
What's the problem of life?
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow in much more.
It's a smile.
So here is my mission.
Even when there are children it's like transforming a failure, a sound.
In music.
And to harmonize what it is.
My sento.
I had a great turn of dollar, Gino Paoli.
And all this would be conclusions, but no, my life was complicated in this way.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
What is the study?
Studying is one of the hardest ways to understand, but also the immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion.
Our inner ears, the colony of bones, our team, reach the massive functional.
return to the fifth week of gestation.
Thirty weeks of gestation: this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching.
And this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
Things that spetheral in life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture.
You shouldn't be afraid.
It must be its own.
So no, in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child is once born.
- Yes.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to music choices, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else.
Okay.
(Applause) What is it, but what is sound?
The sound is this ...
It's all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
In the colony, they are now in every day, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who scavenges us, because mom keeps laughing, not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
Picola for the men of Mility.
a small town by San Pietro.
With your house, maybe?
It captures the same as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me.
I imagined higher, well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So?
starting from this budget.
The visibility?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try!
Imagine our life, I would like to enhance your ability to observe.
Imbactibility.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we start to...
I left the photos of my feet, in wisdom, and then it was the background, Chileans don't exist, I lost the story, but it's multicational, multisensorial, but it's multimultally "food" that had a certain point.
(Laughter)
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others: bahway!
To listen.
Fermarvi?
Like listening.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, hooing it.
Have you perceived?
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life.
The dream of my life, born.
How about harassment?
It's from me.
For the first time, the architect of myself.
It was 2013, I wanted to flee far from school, a series of failures, problems, and other things.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
He listened to the plant.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artistically, it's really far from me.
Shanghai, I decided ...
And participating in a competition, an artistic residence and the most beautiful years of my life was simply listening to me for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only growing, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of all over the world, of all the cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this Sound of City project.
And the whole part, really, from the waste of the cities, is a great musical tool.
To wrap this musical tool, you succeed in entering the city's heart.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a shap colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to swallow you.
ShanghÃ¡.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography differently, and you've become more than once, but to that smoke, that comes from the tombs, that's coming.
But Brooklyn bridge can resonate.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
Everything is completely in the leg.
and the desire to overwhelm.
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Well.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was another part.
It's magical because under our eyes, every day.
And maybe many of you ...
You know a bunch of posts.
In this photo ...
The drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
(Laughter) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds gave me data of these children that in this tube.
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
And now that is elaborated.
This is not.
Salt, to the span of...
(Bianche) Great.
And I like you a little, it seems like...
It's so normal that I've never been, I've been attacked in this very beautiful situation, and it has remained a very low frequency, which has become a syntetizer.
It's a big deal.
It's in the lab.
OK, Genova is Mordandis.
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a fight, it would be one thing.
Anyway.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Junt of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical instrument, and it helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
It's filled with the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I love it!
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become "A".
The door voice of the column are no.
This is the rock sound.
Mr.C.
Hello, now.
I wanted to make you feel Geneva at hand.
This led me to this.
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
You feel this sounds.
I'm sitting on our passions, in my and in your lives, and in the way people will tell you they're rumorous, stupid.
For a long time, she really wants to hear her, and I thank you for listening, thank you.
As Guy Beck says in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but AI, in general, the idea of the Reducation linked to monetary Ristitution, to the benefit.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And to pass from the part of those who say: it doesn't work.
Afterwards in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post of a 18 minutes shared some aspect of this story.
But starting from the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's paper.
It's connected to Segrate.
It's in the same year, my mother Monico has organized the money drop to pay the school.
And it's the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some people said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the Commune State."
Most of them faced these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
But it has taken a billion 200,000 to read, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro, then, and it was an extra effort of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time.
Similarly, the same school at the next school is active, this is the biggest son.
[A.DE.]
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
There's the concept of gameback, of reproduction.
It's extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole of society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Both.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've had good fortune, I reappoint.
She likes school.
Through the university, through the museum, along the the theaters, there are all the communities that can afford to live ...
Reducation of volunteers.
Not that there is really an athlete, there is a phenomenon and a positive circle, there are alsochanisms, there are physical lucidities, there are processes.
Function: a city based on this.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
To the supporters of the famous Obamaker.
It says, "Desiste Miss Dwn" is from Mormento.
Bravo is waiting for us.
Initially, you ask, "You're missing a moment."
Obama has a famous bananachier and has been an incredible technological debt.
There are technological gangs, there are 100 million dollar gaps, so not worried about these things not only happening in Italy.
This is a sound that doesn't work.
A lot of millions of content, and this is the standard response they receive.
In a nutshell, you may not end up for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticating, and you just have to do it.
Starting from criticism, which is easy and normal, trying to do and help, which is extraordinary.
It's not common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Keeping the technology expectations that were sent by Google and other companies, there are wounds.
And I agree with the white house, not rushed, laughing that you put in, put on the seat, stayed, in fun, it was in just a few weeks ago, in a decimal of things.
Many would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
"Yeah!"
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting time, and that's what ...
I'd like to explain to you about what it was like, the spirit of people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible.
And make them again reproduce and scalible.
And they create a replicable system, the IUS of Torris, from this effort, it was born.
A replicable system is what we expect to do as well.
I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, which have been the ows of our lives that have inspired us and have taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, keep insisting, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
As of course, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
I wanted to do it.
Do you want to feed the world?
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Things later, we're five to meet Materence without Francesco, and he came to business in the Silicon Valley, high levels of sensitive need for transformation in general.
Anything has led us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of the public recording.
(Laughter) She asks me, "Why don't you help others for an year's birthday?"
I think, I reflected, the payment with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my capo "Gerpeso" to briefly obtain, I decided to apply a methodology to choose, so in detail that I couldn't reproduce and I couldn't, or I also try to notice, as it was proven.
The choice has been made and so it has been done by Rome for two years.
In the roof of art.
- Ah, manzone.
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you see, you're killed, but from something you'll find under it, these are only many slums, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was, there was.
(Laughter) I would mentally ask myself about chottingism and bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But do you think this disaster of this disguise, and I did not expect, of course?"
Butoscienticism should often have cinism, that throw you a certain mentality.
You never see her, obviously, you do it because you have instructions, I felt like many of this kind.
This country, in truth, lack a lot of sense of common good.
And it's doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interesting.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner.
The older people recognize it, like a high-grade commission, I say this because the title of my children, and then, immediately, from the beginning, of extraordinary commissions, is simply because it's their path that allowed me to assume people from the public record.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is.
It's like the systems from the inside, it's not transformed, right?
We want to try to transform them with people who are out there, where the fact of not knowing the public administration.
It's a sign.
So, of course, we created a small team, I wanted a small team, I said 25 people, not an unstable one, it's an advantage, it's not an advantage.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations around 80 percent, 20% are expected to make legal judges.
Communication designs.
Here you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write?"
What I think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
It's also temporary.
To a compent, probably, is much better than what you see.
How do I keep you?
So I got into the idea, but how can I invite someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photographer in Bella's mind that in the 1947 she caught all the United States, who had given her phone children, all the United States, in this sport, a massive business.
The vision of investments is the influence.
We created the vision.
The country's operational system is a series of fundamental components, about which to build basic, efficient servings for citizens, public management and companies.
It has through innovative digital products.
The vision of beauty, the introduction, is decrime and blood.
I've continued in my place, field of warmth in salt, but in that American future, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also find many complicated rules, unimaginablevoltaic, to a simple prediction.
We must learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many will say, "Don't understand how public administration works."
We've already tried many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
What follows?
Let's take a lot of criticisms: some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and biased.
The criteria of the first group will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and there are many treatments.
The second guy, the people who want to defend the team, is that they always use bicycles.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
This is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the Times magazine cover.
This is here.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible, people to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of course, at least one cent of them decisively qualified, we used digital media channels for the channels, a application called Jazz, we put it in Beth in the Govern Sea, I did a math test and a terdicoli for the technological part, the team gathered the clinical mass, now we are a few teeth, and he was successful for flags, what did we do?
In fact, we are dealing with idraulics.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect because it's a big problem.
"Why?"
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected is silos and not to connect.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machin, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their fears, their applications, so it's about introducing this, explaining it.
In years, implementing this, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
Then there are software, of course, and doing so many activities in management project.
So many Israelic activities.
But we can't also suffer.
To make the games of the stag, in time, you have to make them improve the authentic interface, making more simple things.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your friends you can't do.
After a few months, during the period of 2017 we wrote, in these months, the piano continues to publish the record, together with the help of other people who helped us, what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation of plumbiumbia?
In order to explain there is one thing, there is.
Due.
It has written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
The first time it was...
According and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole affirmed the decreto of the present as minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the formal element riches a team game to simplify amministration public, the city's life, particularly of the piano.
It has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, there are especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
What is this, the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
According to the recovery of the technological rules and the rules may probably pick up three warning wages and connections to other norms, and at some point there are quite dark and incomprehensible technical rules: unfortunately we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: the triennal piano.
He brought his hands to the technological ones who understand him, and he brought his way to go.
Talking to administrators, making us give feedback, documentation on Ox Rides, so that the administrators themselves, the technological leadership of software can't.
Let's change it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always the part of the piano.
At the population platforms, these are the competitive platforms, they're the digital payments, they're the things that abilitate in general all the public administration public activities, and even more there will be.
Digital payment is one: Digital payment is one, electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
Let's do that.
Panalizing technologically all the data of citizen citizens that at this time are about 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the huge database unknown.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk to the rest of the administration applications: when I come across a community to the other side.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago we made an Akaton Seria.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
In Wag-fixing, therefore, putting up software problems.
The understanding of documenting and even new projects.
It was created in 25 Italian cities.
Without Francesco, it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from a technological point of view, from the European.
All of this?
It influences - we're talking about sustainability and replicity, in the beautiful territory of Italy, just like the T, where the wives, all the documentation.
All code, but always more, applications.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what should be, maybe even of me.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that officially...
They're not limited to do an iraulic, I enter into the ball as well as the child.
But it serves that the tablets are composed, let me disappoint this, this might be, for example.
And it's one of those things to briefly.
When we'll launch Alsa version, Alfa, it's called digital citizenship.
Do you have a phone?
Smartphone has the digital identity, data has the card of electronic identity, Nepsi.
Are there already functional?
And all this is the aim of making it easier, familiar with the interaction of citizens is the management public.
The interface is simple.
We are dreaming a little, because work will really do so much, but it has different vision of this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen.
It was asked to talk about simplification of the life of the citizens every day.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it.
We design a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rules and not the institution.
A country in which they read and recognize and promote the right to innovate, to prevent building it.
A country with high technological competitions is also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine, up to a country where to work for public administration is an eye: where the best humans do to work in public research centers, that are green and proper centers of eccellence and innovation.
They lead development to the country.
Now I'm a dream.
And what the components to do all this process policies?
Technical data are really many and maybe many.
But if it's not a dream that difficult to punish hardly, they can do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Beauty did it do."
[A.DE.]
And here, somewhere in this theater, between the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and you couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like the slums, like the 25 kids of digital transformation, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Anything.
What if you wanted information about us?
Our dream and our social children.
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life.
That it's not going to be passed.
What would you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know it's, then raise your hand those who will change some of your body, maybe you lose some threads.
Or maybe you won in muscles?
(Laughter) I was sure that I wouldn't have all of you, or maybe you'll be among you who will change partner.
(Audience): Yes.
Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't understand if I took part, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have a more united family, but my parents were separated.
(Applause)
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
The lice would have smelled the most complex professors, it seemed to me all eyees and I reflected in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Besides, the university would have wanted to work, but I found out the difficulty of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I started fighting and letting it to try to understand how to change things that didn't affect me from what others thought of me on the biggest economical feasts, of the interpersonal relationships with characteristics that I acquired from birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
And these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but since most of the cases were the only three posts of playing in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up in order to keep their lives with their issues.
Nowadays, the strategy is more broadcast.
It's lamenting.
We're lamenting a bit about it, we're sorry a little about it, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, frustrating, that I'd have done differently, we lament ourselves because there's no injustice, and we know a lot of people who stuck in the mind's chest, this paralysises you, the notizza, and it fits.
I was buying homeland.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who wasn't doing anything but to get bothered, from when I started to talk, and then the boys with whom he translated her, so the fact that she didn't have a job, the ultimate ship of the government that didn't help her, sat with a value, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized her during her daily life.
So, get along with it.
For all of us, it's a little the great attempt.
Because with a small effort.
I want to obtain a great result.
To remove the rule of the victim.
Because it's listened, comforted, helped.
But don't worry.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
From alone or with friends, to a high voice?
What in your mind?
And you can remember one thing already happened, or one thing that maybe one day could happen.
And you can unleash your surroundings.
As it's much more often happening, you can lie down to the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you're forced to memorize hardly something around you will change, old, there's no other way to pay more attention to what's in fasting.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as adults, is that of lamenting.
Suppose that someone is at the studio of a B. B.
To save your sheet.
Let's go.
Another verytoned strategy, when things are stretching, is that of imporciation, it requires our necessity.
But at the base of this mentality there is an increasing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being what surrounds us.
You don't like ducks.
But from those who are skeptical noises?
But why are you feeling a little dangerous?
I took two pillars and solved it easy.
The wife breaks you?
Divority.
In the fresh, let's get all the risks in the palm.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
It's too big that we can't reach it, send it to the psychologist: we're here, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, so that the world around you can encourage the perfection with your own needs.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, is.
The relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during which I'm doing another thing, that listening to what, according to the other, would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
He is.
Well, it's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in a grade.
It's not a classic.
And the law, right?
"I'm the one who never asked me, if not for those."
And he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do another way to get me uncontrol, and that's how, in the end, a strong iron-looring arm that always starts with the same stream word.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old.
Instead of removing the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy they privilege.
When things are not going like wearing, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result, think about a couple of times, because you will have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's...
Fair enough that there are no, like a tool, take the forehead, put it under the ground.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the deserve of necessary needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that the time was openly driven in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this situation is limited, it's clear.
It taught important things, for example, it learned.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no.
Things that didn't follow him, I didn't learn to say no to the relationships that were looking for him, there was any social condition, and he was one of the places where everyone was to measure, but in this way where they were to finish their needs, their desires, and their ambitions were always under the fear of facing conflict, and the need to focus on here.
And the strategy that privilege, when things are not as you are, is that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of containing all of this.
I'll finish to disrupt it.
I wanted to get lamented.
To integrate your needs, or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in my life, in my life, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the team for which I collaborated, sent me to call and told me.
I think it's there, for her, there's no room anymore, if I like to keep complaints with us, you have to accept a transfer.
And he showed me a far away, spermful, detached from the most. Besides, I would have to go there to do a job that neither had a great deal with all that I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to regret me.
Trying to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and not even because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbeatable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret...
To change others.
It's changing yourself.
If it had changed me?
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
And if it was a psychologist that was really brilliant, competent, complete, united, the primary school wouldn't have sent me via.
If you see it as well.
That didn't take me more intensity.
In a few years, maybe I would have traveled to see, first again, that immigration.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
Why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones that change.
And the first change we have to do?
He goes to the agreement of choosing us.
And choose you.
What's the cause of things?
that they don't leave as they are.
Keep in mind as a cause of things that are not going.
This is our challenge.
If you haven't ever had a job at the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
And I'll be there alone, and guilty, to confront something much bigger, I'd like to say, it's the basis of the crisis, what do you want to do?
But if it's part of you, and think of being perfect that maybe there's a marginal of change, that then improved, then you open your doors in front of you, because it's sharing your responsibility, you can always learn a new language, read books, go to chores to acquire new abilities, or consolidate those you already have, you can work on yourself to become a journal.
Because life is the one who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
And if things are not right in the coppy, you think that it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It is sending them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
Then things change.
But they don't change the case, but they change because you know you've changed, I used to go to the research of your needs.
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate.
to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war.
(Audience) Yes.
I know one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call, let me in the end, national prostitute, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them.
Then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a type's standard.
It's starting to work on me, considering the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to warn to be a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes pressure, to bring great value to their lives.
But, friends, I met a couple of...
What about the problem?
Stereotipi, prejuicios, obscologism is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but it will talk to a friend, but it goes to the barbecue.
But what would I have to do?
I would have had to get lamented or not to explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
No, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead?
Imports mine.
It's the turn of...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and it's finally decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not as he intended.
I've handed here.
I became the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here by the hilly lady, I say to get along with her anxiety.
Magari think it was.
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 1979, published psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best editors, in Italy, was my magazine, and what surrounded me more than anything.
It was the recognition that the bonds initially moved a bit of strangers.
I want to negotiate.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbia, they were elected to the president and their presidence.
I had dreams.
They don't become real because.
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps you hold and makes you move forward, the ones who don't know how to build and need to reflect, because the topic should do it.
And so you should put into discussion your identity, your partners' points, your certainties, your flaws of similar.
What if there's something I learned from all this journey that helps me?
(Audience) Yes.
It's that the most important transition.
This is the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For many reasons, I've been asking you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of life.
What would you change?
I've talked about work.
The current physical aspect of the current conting.
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, the less you prove, it's a small question that was very useful to me personally.
And that's based on the logic that, in order to generate big changes, you have to focus on so many small actions.
What's the thing?
And it's easier.
What could you do until now, at the end of the store, with the torn in case after this beautiful newspaper?
And that will allow you to take the first step.
To put ...
Your life in the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You may think: Which is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do?
to put your life into the direction.
Fedetto.
"Oh, are you joking about the rubbish, what do I send?"
Or feels right now, I went with the pullman, right?
Where do I put the packs?
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I made my hand, I knocked my pelle.
In her feet, it's now to change.
Quite when I arrived to my mother.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
with diverse and different abilities.
percussions are so fast.
So immediate.
They take off the distances and join the battles.
We are partners.
We are part of the sets.
His kids, I see them, I see Laura, fear.
It's Daniel.
I saw him growing.
Our provides were marketing.
The Friday was the day of protest, where it was entered.
Studying at the Andreoli music school.
They were picking the first bidonies.
It was together.
The first one deserves together.
Then we decided to become part of the band.
And from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw: the first transcend, the first marriages in the class, the first satisfaction, the first ones.
Conclusion?
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Soundly?
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we stayed.
The earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
On the other hand, it was completely district.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
Io, Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo.
We focused on everything.
You can see it in doppoli.
And the erlotte?
We've done it.
Luckily, we found everything.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manitis, of military purposes.
Within that tender?
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth shaking?
To search...
A smile?
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubophons that have become?
tools that are built and combined with ping pong roots.
The crying leaves with big markets,
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, there was always an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already there is born our first spettacol.
We decided...
Let's put it on a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to speak.
We've become 25, 30, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards.
We did.
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also display a moment from our Earth.
to breathe for a moment.
A few years later we've cracked, this marine show.
The next moment ...
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
Stop the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look.
The sea.
There were so many things inside this tender.
And no one of us would have ever thought it's a stone?
It could change our lives.
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
Mults are ending.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 concerts in return to education.
The dove of the first magician?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
What about the maternal backyard?
And we really did a lot.
And they also give me pupils, because that's exactly me.
It's the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also...
This is freshness.
That there are so many possibilities and future.
What happens when a dream?
Really.
Now I have to go back to the sports mirrors.
Do you wait?
What is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, I'm actually born as a researcher, until I realized what has happened in the last 250 years.
Well, I'm ...
250 years that have changed our history radically, and that we live now.
What do we talk about social innovation?
And my question is, what is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be adapted around innovation.
But this is the digital photo: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, and I believe so everything.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution, which actually includes an evolution which has been extraordinary for the last 25 years, is an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs in fact.
The internet revolution is connected, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution in the internal phase of our history, and these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, in some way, strictly, bought arbitrarily in the 2000s, that we are living today.
But let's understand, then, what has happened in these 250 years, which ones flood?
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the broadcast on the Internet, we considered it an iron.
What was my studies?
I'm in some school books, but it wasn't only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we've got huge debates, we're usually discussers, for example, because we need the coast bike.
And the winning motor is not only a winning motor, but for example, the tool that has favored, and it resembles much faster, the carbon estation.
And the possible to a significantly lower cost, and then the vapore motorbike entered the cordals, entered the funds, and started to change the modality, but it didn't make it.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
We also need to use the glass motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanan invitation, it's an Italian invention, the scoppy motorcycle.
And we need, for example, the automobility industry.
In fact, first, it was used in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motorbike that couldn't go from the ferment, when I was able to understand how to get that belt to get it from the verb and to that belt that developed the automobility industry, which is all that was originated.
But they are not.
And in the Industrial Revolution we are still advertising, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, from one part to the other of the world, always smaller than he knew.
But is it also what has allowed us?
And it has taught us to deposit the digs.
To submit.
And yes, because after the phone, we could try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
Let's interrupt everything.
We went on, going on the caves under the sea, the first cave to give a storic dimension was taken from artists between Mexico and artistic artists, not just two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave went there.
And we are around 1858.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
In Europe it was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
Today, there's the last stage: a time in 1873 was built the first electric power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, it was lit by a store.
It's a part of our history, it's a great swimmer.
But let's move forward, we tried to get a bit longer rooms, and we arrived in 1950, the adventure has already grown and knows a certain agency, which has been a seventh.
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important events and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never happened before in the past history: the computer, the sidewalks.
The collectors who, in the beginning of the 50s, could be in a stance like this, and had marriage functions, just made the calculus quickly.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be artificial intelligence that we know.
But in these 50 years of the internet revolution occurred a little more, there were times of research, and above all, there were scope of tubes and defense that brought us to develop land-based lands, but they didn't know why they were not known.
It has at a certain point.
He decided to open these letters.
These rots called arpa, the Internet.
They became and began to be the World Web, which we know.
A system diffused, orchontal, non-archical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, to collect information and were only 35 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
And when does the power function?
It was, as I said, that was replaced by the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
And the Internet had the ocean that, if little by little, we started to live the ocean that we've lived now, that we're living now, that which is called by the Internet, and this according to a phenomenon of creative creation.
In the end, an industrial process says that what's new gradually distruggles what's old because it needs to take a space, and we'll see better how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions, but there is a story that is a little more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which we start to reflect, to accompany you.
It was 1863 when, from the scale, it wasn't the Italian yet.
The Minister Minghetti, provided Mingetti's license, established that the 27th century of the doctor, is free, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing injuries, I'm introducing something extraordinary.
But first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce good servings, that were necessary for their support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And above all.
It has transformed the economic power of power of production.
of goods and services, in the power of producing one.
Well, the denaro.
But there is a second aspect.
What's the sign?
But for us women, obviously, it was a revolution that made us read enough.
But, actually, it was the hemisphere.
It's not only that object that free us from the urgency of going to sphere every day, but it's also this industrial system that allows us to keep it.
In a massive way, a structured way, healthyly, in the soil quantity of food.
So there's the chance, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of the daily life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
And in the breath, what did we say?
They didn't reach the computer and the Internet arrived, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, which is a element that we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
In the past 250 years, we didn't have speeds as we are today, we do things very fast, and we move fast the speed of the rivers, the speed of movements, the speed of our thoughts, which is not the detail of the thought, but we are very fast.
But until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900 to 2000, when we can say it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that are significantly segmented in the passing of one another, 2001 and 2001 because in total.
The American economy started to slow down, the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, began to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were used to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
However, there were Europeans who were to fail, the police was no longer the warning of failure, they don't talk about it, but still there.
And I changed something.
But what has changed has changed the economical paradigm, we couldn't.
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis, which was effectively verified in 2008; it was crazy, we didn't think, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would happen.
We were assisted to not know how to wait, to look at these companies.
And this print?
Because there are potential multinationals in most of them, but above all, all the companies that are given after 2011.
And what did those companies do, aren't they innovated?
They were inventing something, they had never been able to build something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done, buy, sell, travel, learn.
Think about it.
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
And he answered, "Come?
It's so often denied.
We tried to look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors: connectivity, we are ten percentage below the average, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection between 50 feet, and so it is little.
Anything, according to human abilities of human resources, the ability to heal it from a being distant between advanced and competitive abilities, the abilities based on what allow us to flow.
There are informational systems, digital systems, and advances that allow us to develop them.
And a third fact that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
This is the publication system: we immediately go through some ambiguity and keep the enemies of the important, and above all a good news for everyone: everyone, every and every five element is growing.
I'm all five elements that are growing up, at a speed of growth completely athletics up to two years ago, so we're reaching European countries, and this doesn't want to notice.
But on the other hand, connectivity, we said it, 11 points out.
But, objectively, is enough to watch the newspapers and see who?
We are growing fast, there are new buildings, new operators, new competitions, and we are building a very important and competitive topic, the use of the Internet, frankly we are truly applied seconds.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we should look at very carefully that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the abilities and the inclusion of the digital in the productive factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first motorbike?
It's what has done most of the time in the '50s and the pictures of the companies.
But glasses from being, the small printed media.
Something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't require the biggest multinationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
And you know how to do something extraordinary: "Made in Italy" has a quality, an eccellence in the production of services in the production of product.
It's quite united in their position, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, abilities inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve.
It's a safe interaction.
The market, extraordinaryly, generating ricks for all the texts around us, and this is the first as we have, the first great motorcycle, the second motorcycle that, above all, is its cultural artistic heritage.
Behind, a heritage that nature, for its existential nature, thanks to Dio, is an analytical heritage, and we have an analogical heritage, we can't digitalize the croceo.
But can tourists?
Not only three cities.
Comeuela, Firenze Rome, and then cut.
But the ricks of these three cities don't make the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've been able to start, but we're able to recover, including.
This heritage within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it and make it black and bring it to tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our countries.
I believe that this is your great assurance that we can do to our Italy.
The issue I discovered.
I talked to myself in a certain sense, and the opposite of the word.
What to unify?
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, I'd like to start in a new way.
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
The witch loses.
Secondly, in the last ones.
15, 20 years.
We said in the 21st century.
In the world, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens are increased, can decrease.
But I believe most of you would answer.
They're increased, if you're also journalists, maybe you'll add.
The active, the prezemolo.
They are increased exponentially.
A: It's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be, too.
I've been asking myself these questions for the last years and with...
Only 24 hours is the video shows.
I was prepared with my colleagues for a rapportopment.
We know about inequality, from when they are data, that is sustainablely from 1960.
For the vast majority of countries in the world.
- Yes.
The result was the one.
This is the curve.
The abandonment of inequality in the world's citizens, as you can see, was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 80s, but in the beginning of this.
By the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated now we're at the storic mining.
In Italy?
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality in the growth.
How can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is that of saying: we've entered a complete alcohol, because we've continued to talk about years of increase of inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are myself?
We don't find it?
And ... the feeling wasn't wrong, but the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Wow!
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality: what do we understand?
For inequality.
Maybe the reason of inequality?
It requires some time to think about it.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And also in this case: we moved to Cambridge in 1928.
One year before the big crisis of 29: Lickens.
That Cambridge added a speech in front of me.
To a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, in that occasion, Keynes forms two professors.
The first one says.
It was a seventh, the product.
But for a while I'll be working ...
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this profile, indeed, is realized, because if you're about to engage.
The richest agricultural reforms of the economy.
Effectively, in most society, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years, as well.
Of course, twelve times, in some 15 occasions, so this profile was realised, but from this professor Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
Little by little, here, you can say, little to 100 years, it would be found with a huge quantity.
The free time that abroad would lead to...
Lavoring less.
She also said to her to work on everybody, and when she told her that she didn't want much less, she wanted a week of 15 hours of work.
Well, I have a couple of three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
Very well.
Apparently, this second trust didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
But me ...
I'll be able to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We will remember much less, we will work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not made from any part, we'll listen to those flooded suces.
This is the first proof.
The curve, or this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
To work through your life.
Your life, naturally, potentially working, that is, when we're 15 years old.
In terms of doing a job, let's take a look at this anecdote, Keynesi's teacher really has realised.
Because we reached Novecent beginning, almost 40% of the time in our lives to work.
And now we call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
Great.
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already put it on.
Naturally?
If this has happened, there are reasons too.
Have you and if you want a banal, for example, the old lady is normallyung.
Because we die a lot after life expectancy and who is chosen to choose something like 27 years from the beginning to the year 2000, and there's another reason, and it's also very positive, and otherwise, it's also studies up to 25 and 30 years, so young age is burned.
(Laughter) But there is a reason, maybe, more fundamental, why.
Our quote of time?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And that's it.
The trafficking rate, that is, the number of people.
What was it? What was it?
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion.
And this series of dramatic stories, as you can see, what?
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even more.
I hope it's more than 70%.
Today we are very low, we are around 50 percent scary, old.
From 1968 one year.
The occupation rate has always been lower than 50%.
But a range of occupation?
It includes 50 percent.
What does that mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income.
Okay, I worked.
In front of this?
Farming action: we can also have a reaction.
But it's enthusiastic, and say, "What about this?"
Progress, beauty, is modernity.
Things are gone like this, because we can do it, but then we can see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things are gone in the same way, because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, and then we can see the confrontation.
Good afternoon.
In Italy.
There were units.
This is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while it comes from us.
Surely, what's more impressive is the storic series of the occupation rate, because here we can see.
There is an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency to the rate of occupation in the United States to the monument, in our case, we have a situation.
Riduation.
at the occupation rate.
But then that?
Education is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
There are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most people live in a condition that I defined -
Dipendence in parassity, in addition, because from the way to your wisdom depends.
This can also be a family member, the State.
But would it stop, why do I consume?
I have the available income without working.
I'm a friend who does theater's work.
When did I find these results?
We were at the scene and I asked them.
And how did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence?
And he knows what answered me.
With Epopopopopopopower is that excellin.
It's on the back of theppopotam and it's called buffago, some say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The buffag or the buffag on the scale, or on the other big mammals, these murderers also live on the rinocerontes, on the buffs, we have this film.
What's going to be there for a second in which you see?
These are the ones.
The animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
By taking advantage of the resources that ...
The buffler supplies, which are insisted, larvae, stuff everything that holes on the golden dorsis, it's not clear if the hammer is unfastated by the hell.
Anyone.
This is sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
Another thing is how we can define a situation like this, how we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers and a minority of producers.
There is this kind of uncondutive consumption: the first, there and there, I said to myself, but is this the sign language society?
Society signals like the feudal society in which there is a change that has placed in the conviction of living without working.
(Laughter) But naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
What can be defined?
In a signorious society, but a society that's useless.
"Yes."
Because consumers are more than producers.
In the simple and classic sign society, we have the sign and the serves of the grey that they produce for him, in society.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission: in the massive society things are a little more complicated, the signs have become so many and...
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, the idea would define a damaging relationship, let's see why.
The relationship?
And it's the buff with the hypothomo and parasitism, and this is an advantage in green, but it's also dependent, because it depends on the food it's there.
At the bottom of the hippopotomo, the red thinth indicates an advantage.
And also from the view of the producers, we came back to a green light, a green light, the Epopopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need the buffer.
Because we can't, we can't epower, we can't feed the animals living on our homes, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of damage, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
That's it?
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
The question I had made talking about Keynes: today, perhaps, the only inequality and inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very asmetrical in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools of the protection of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent coherent concentration of neighbors that the tool with which we measure from inequality we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the position of the year is to be lost in the graduation, together?
This is Turchia.
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this grader, the best situation, that of the Union beach, with the USA in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
In the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured that efficient decent, you can see something pleasant, that inequality is the worst for the jobs in more, our families.
You would accept it.
Million euro per month, and in addition, there were around 12,000 euro per month.
The year.
And our state would have 15 billion euros to spend, as much as the sanity cost and school put together, more or less in Italy, but here concluded, there is one but.
Hi.
We have the scholarship to write in the first art of Costitution, which is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country.
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
That's why.
Or we change things.
And we create the six million jobs that are missing.
Or maybe it's better to download the article one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a BEFA.
Thank you.
