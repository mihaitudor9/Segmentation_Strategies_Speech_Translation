(Applause)
In 2016, I was given a reward, from the out of a cingüelinian protest, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly.
Necessarily, they are full of advice.
KA: The motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
In different forms, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
So when I go into class, I usually go into class.
The first ten minutes, when the students come and are seven?
The companion of my computer to analyze and use classical music: I think this is the first step to create environments of fewer acalling data and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative.
To transmit the knowledge to the students.
And precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on everyone's shoes, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942, the UK.
Blockchain park.
A residence northern Londra.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator of tastes, but, older than stealing in a paper ...
This one, those letters, I think of stamping other letters, according to a code imposed mécanically under the machine.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper was in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main figures of Black.
Putting them and constructing them a car.
It's the one you can see.
Dietro: How can we decipher?
This test is written by ATDSC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
(Laughter)
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about Mind's magazine.
computer and machine learning.
Does anyone proposes the tension test?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be another person?
Keep it and use the computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a "o" operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
They form the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) It's said that the Mach takes to overcome the Turing test if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
[A.DE.]
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
What's the moment they get?
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man?
All men are dead?
Socrates are dead.
This is an active argument.
There are two legislative prizes.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
Is it near to build deductive arts?
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people, an entity.
Then you must act.
It must be adapted to this.
Do you have to get a goal and know how to bring them to end?
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects.
Riforming Turing's quote, a machine can think.
We can say, is it possible to make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
What about this?
Do you know what I mean?
They are trying to build intelligent and supported artificial integrity of man.
It's a cycle.
That's what I want to do.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I would like to explain to you about the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I would like to use it.
Five classics to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
Human beings.
Human beings have the optimal actors.
I'd like to share with you some examples: optimal agents are the agents that benefit better from all men and can't do better.
For example, a young man has been raising, for example, people who resolved the rubber of Rubik, playing four strengths in the best way, playing a sadness.
From the start of the Rubik cube, it was resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any month ago they created an agent, a robot that could resolve in 0.63 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, the game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the green aircraft, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who act almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game.
I will ask the question of the election.
We use "para" or "maning".
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
We are talking about the fridge.
How is it?
Mela.
Or are we talking about the Marco of Apple Corporation?
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with a exponential call.
This is a sad moment.
The measurement predicted in the wall legislation, in which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, two years ago and in quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045, and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
Where is the articulum?
I've published my mind magazine.
Turing does not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against the same test.
These observations are us and bections against artificial intelligence.
And a few years ago?
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the things we had to call was proposed, was a student at the University of Varese, following a epistimology, deontology and ethical illness of computing, carried out by professor Gaitano in Lanzerone, against Twing test.
I'll tell you artificial intelligence.
I was the only one who proposes a graduated contract with mathematical communication.
"What is the stupidity of human?"
Would you like to write in simple terminals, let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
Tell the seed.
The symbol of the summit has the lead to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
We don't have ...
An equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story ...
Let's start with the first question.
I can use machines to think.
I'd like to share with you ...
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) (Music)
[A.DE.]
Good afternoon.
(Applause)
But how many of you today have shown a few photos?
Craziness.
MM: OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely by hand, and the measure of not having worked completely by hand, and I'm a person who has so many photos with their own phone, which doesn't make me a photograph, I've spent the last three years, often the cell phone phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here to discuss.
Technical consciousness that is in the production of a scenario, in part of a photographer and a new linguistic language, in the way it influences both theesteem of their formal choices, the experts of their experiments of sharing images through cellulating.
To find answers around me, I looked around and arrived in New York, at the record of Torre de Torre de New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parents, in the sale of Parifoto, one of the most prestigious photography fears in the world, to enter those places where photography is distributed, is sold, is put in account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these inequalities.
To find answers, I tried to look further, beyond the surface of the big places that are visually visible in contemporary.
The selfie, for example, is a selfie to be involved simply in a global narcissistic disorder, like some sociologists supported with the basis occupational of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as an avocation of seventions, as an identified settlement, as a so-called variation of their imagination.
Or Ash Roagger, the thermal therapy that has shaped and still secrets both our mobile vision.
This is my channel, almost, who was designed by my photographic experiments, and simply the result of a world's intimidity of nice taste. Or, as the sociologist has sustained swimming in New Yorkenson, can't be led to the thinner of more complex fators of social, storical and even economical nature.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations, and from this phenomenon I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
Because in front of the edge of images that we're wired of, it seemed useful to me to draw a map, if not to find the route at least to understand where we are, which is called the "revolution," applied to a story of the mobile photographs.
And so we are: the history of the mobile photography is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people?
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
BB: The production and the diffusion of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, had a retirement about professionals, became an extent of linking our daily experience.
A way of social interaction, a can of demonstration of our fellow manner in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through images that we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that was strongly remarked by the process of referring them daily, the fluid of photographic mobility seems the way natural expressions, a fluid vision that is composed by compounds.
It may simply be based on the constant gratification of our need for sharing, but in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their phone call.
That the path left behind the professional photographer and the difference between Western photos and conscious photos, from a part the ease of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
Speaking in account of that process of democratization of photography, I started with theera Kodak and arrived at the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
On the one hand, opening up to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker, with a potentially global initiative, has moved the professional photographer of his professional role as a set of images, has put in crisis the social foundation, the economical position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
We are trying to be a powerful tool to guide public opening and capture a source of computers and information available to the regions: this is a picture of three thoughts, one shows that the rule of the mobile photographs in the spider's spring; on the other hand, but.
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he released the necessity of accepting a political agend, a law and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalistic priority, he has liberated it from the impossibility of reaching limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly into the good of News, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
He offered Mega Zenthim in 2012, with Instagram coverage, founded by an American photography, Research, Cournissen, and dedicated to conservation of the universal heritage of family photography, surrounded by photography and society in the 90s.
We went through healing team, like 14-15 photographers, an international spacecase, products and distributed through iPhone, created by those Italian photographs, Giulio and Napolitano and Giorgio Kosulice, through a job of scaling on the accenting of large photographs, with a magical consciousness of authority.
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Benjamin Lowi.
Orona Vive, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
The solar panic that, through a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers of stance in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
(Video) Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and has made a huge drug deal of intimate and minimal narration on the majority of alcohol liters.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempted Community to the partners around his job.
Let's use it daily to build its family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
Following a field, which, through the Everest African Championship, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African Africa, along with media stereotypes, of the Western matrix on the crisis and the famine, showed how mobile phones.
They are Stephan of the Luis, who has reinterpreted the God's seed with the cellulare, telling in the IV series, one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history, with the most new vision tool.
Or how the Lord Linde shown, who has photographed his successive manifesters in the sink, who is during the protests of Mai-Tan, with an old puzzled bronic, and nowadays has registered and contemporary streams, what do you know how to do these photographs that we don't know how to do?
To dream, walking down the outskirts of the action or looking for tables of personal vision of many levels of the evolution, to avoid more than register, to design in a huge media action, thinking and creating the proper contents to be broadcast in diverse platforms and reach different fields.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To be able to think about the authorial exercise of its own perspective on the world and the quality of deep-function, because whatever the possible recovery tool, only if the photographic project is smiled by a solitary, articulated in a powerful way.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
All of this I believe still makes the difference between a photograph that was reinforced in real life, its reproductive bubble, its self-referent and share, and a photograph that of reality can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
Actually, what we believe is to be silenced is 50 a/h of electric race.
Now, 50/50 have arrived underdolly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist.
So in this room, those sectors, these seeds, and add a frequency of 50 ARS, then you imagine not, you shoot home after a job magazine that is really stressing.
Even better, you compete with your partner, in case, and then you'll get up to bed in your bedroom and think of being alone, and instead, that I simply increased the volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
(Music) Now.
We have a positive side: Or better, I leave first from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Believe it or not.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50/s isn't much more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I was overwhelmed, "But why do you do that, why not make music?"
I am a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, or a little particularly, because my life was complicated, deciding to make music on its own and exclusively through the sound.
My parents divorced when I was little, and I know you to think that this is the classic 'backyard' history, but no, it was the revelation of my life, so each complement of the left was no longer.
(Applause) A classic that complements the fermod, immobile, first of a voice, but becomes my musical instrument, with great joy between the other of my mother, that every eight is not at the end of the cliches, among the other Macciao, you're looking at me from Austreaming, and this is a great truth.
I say, at some point,
Anyone is going to become a normal person, trying to say, "Dear because I started studying yesterday."
It's the pianoforte.
And then I liked Woody Allen, so I started smiling the Clarinetto, the problem Arenzo Arbore really liked, who wrote a personally ambiguous song, was bringing it all the first years of studio in genius.
But I also dropped Clarinetto.
But that's right, to dare not to make my classmates' illusions.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spontaneous sounds in a way, and I like to disagree with the problems of life.
All of us have attached a rumor, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the sound has made us grow much more.
And it's from a smile, here's where my mission ...
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
It's a gatto.
I cried?
I'd love poetry, right?
I'm going to make a great turn of dollar, kidneys, and it's all going to be conclusive, but no, I've got complicated this way of life.
What's the sound?
But most of all?
That's the study, and with the study, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring a closer look: our inner eye, the catalogue of the musicians, our team, reaches the maximum functional around the fifth week of gestation.
I say twenty weeks of gestation: this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching, and this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
I hope that speternity in life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture, mustn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, not in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, there's no need to be stupid if the child, once he was born, will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistols, so the mother will prepare you, and it's a reform that I give you personally attention to the musical choice, attention to the church, more than anything else, OK?
But what's the sound?
The sound is all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
Yeah!
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
But it's the sound column of every day, the ritual of our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom scratches us, not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Well ...
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We know it.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than how you imagine them.
There's the smallest of the Milan man, the smallest of San Pietro, the smallest of anything.
"A small house of you, maybe?"
(Laughter)
It captures the same thing, as when a person sees me on video, watches on stage, and then there are hundreds of people, and says, "But you imagined high, well, why is it more low, would it be really impossible?"
Through this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
[Yes!]
Let's dream of imagining our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe, then we're in vaccine.
We're on the sea, not in case, and we started a food blog, which is then opening, so we called a drone to take a picture of the drink, on its side, then a little beside, then 360 and arrived at the dinner time, there's the sweet, no, not to eat the sweet, because I have to take a lot of photos: "Wow, I'm a fled blog or a fled blog, a flash blog, a flash blog, I'm not, I've lost the story.
"Food" and ... no one sees the damage.
We photograph it, we keep it.
We make a lot of video, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone...
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that between others doesn't exist:way, and ...
Listen.
To listen and to.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, would I like to take you with me?
Revolving it around the world.
Your perception of listening ...
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life, born from school.
In my own.
For the first time, the school of myself: it was 2013, I wanted to go far away from the adventure, a series of failures, problems and others.
So, I decided to choose, which later turned into harmony, but I decided to find a far away place from Africa.
A city of Atlantis.
Atlantis, yes, it's true, there were still a lot, I went to an artistic residence and the most beautiful years of my life for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening, there was still a lot of people, who would choose one of the most remote, culturally, artically and truly far away.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear, I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of all over the world, of all the cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of City."
And I created a sound column.
So, in this moment ...
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
(Applause)
In Ivovatão, a prisoner, they spin that I was a nest from a dun.
(Sound of calcium) Innibolated which most deals with those laughs for a long time.
- As crazy as it inspired me to those people, it robbed me.
(Video) (Video) (English) I'm an interview, I'm an interviewer, a cane, a cane, a cane, a cane, a cane, a cane, a cane, a cane.
(Music) (Applause) You all have to be focused on visibility, and this has been a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've had photography all the way, and you're all over once, but that smoke, that comes from the tombs, which appeared, but the Bridge of Brooklyn, is an exceptional one that defines everything in its leg.
and the desire to resonate with the upset.
(Making a device for mechanical ventilation) (Sound of device for mechanical ventilation) (Music) (Music) (Piano chord) (Music)
(Applause) I ask you to tell me that I was truly fond of a collapse and something very important to say.
Hello, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
In this photo ...
The helpless drop is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are capabilities many times, there are volutly captained many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it this way, I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, kick the applause, I'll leave you - (Applause) I started to record the first songs, and the first songs, of iron and co-banon, made me this urban camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
(Music) And now we've worked it: and I've been to the span of older people.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
(Music) Saturday and a half, randomed.
(Laughter) And it wasn't a fight, it would be: certain Genova is "Mor Zandis."
Every time.
The writer, which you can see so easily in the Ferrari' desk, is not just a writer, but to me it's a great musical instrument, and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
(Music) This is a bit like that.
Well, the last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
Look at the bars of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that has given me a particularly frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become the core of the colony.
(Sigh) That's her aircraft.
(Music)
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
"Ah!"
(Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) "Don't breaks, it's breaking.
(Applause) Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
(Laughter) Almost with our passions in my and in your lives, and as people will tell you that I'm rumorous, I'm out of time, I really want to hear them, and I'll give you back to school, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
As Guy Bakni Italian said, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in general, the idea of the concept linked to monetary Ristitution, to the benefit of it.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "We don't do anything," then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approached us, so the next 18 minutes shared some of this story.
But starting from the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's paper.
In this same year, my mother Monico organized the money recipe to pay the school to the Tuesday, near Segrate.
From the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, and with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the normal state."
Most of us do these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community, has picked up a billion 200,000 readings, because it doesn't get richer, it's 600 euro from then.
And it was one of the strengths of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time.
Similar, the same school as a school in the middle school is involved, and this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
Which means the gameback of restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole of society.
Not that the 6 of American is perfect.
Nothing else.
I've said this the thing of restitution: I've had good fortune, I reappoint.
She likes school.
Through the university, through the museum, along the the theaters, there are all the communities that can afford to live ...
Reducation of volunteers.
Not really voluntary, but there's a phenomenon and a positive circle, then there's also...
The mechanisms, there is physical instability, there are the processes.
But there's no need for that.
I've been working for ten years, some of you may have met him, that's the sweatbox.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker, who says, "Desistemis Done is the moment."
We are already trying very actively to ask ourselves, "System is one of the time."
Obama well-known bananachia, and it was an incredible technological debt.
The technological plans haveeso 100 million dollar salts, so not worried about these things, they don't only happen in Italy.
They build a seed that doesn't work so many millions of contents, and this is the standard response they receive.
In a nutshell, the criteria doesn't end for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticating, and it's enough, it has been given to do.
It's easy and normal to start by trying to do and help that is extraordinary.
And if we don't have a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Keeping the technology expectations that were sent by Google and other companies, there are wounds.
And as I agree with the white house, they've rushed, laughing that you put in, put on the seat, stay, works in just a few weeks ago, at one decim of the costs.
Many of us would probably have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
What happens?
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting, and that's what...
I want to spare people, and not to explain what it was like.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible?
And making them back, repetitive and renewable, and creating a replicable system that YouTube is, from this effort has been born.
A replicable system, what we expect to do as well.
I want to suffer from the word models, because we also impose the models, which are the odds of our lives, that have inspired us and that have taught us.
Those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, to continue to insist.
Energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
And for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Many years ago, the idea of going back to help was also because they're Italian.
What about it?
I wanted to do it: two random tricks.
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
(Audience): Yes!
Twenty years later, we're five to disconnected "materence without Francesco," and the avvenue started using valuable bicycles, high levels of sensitive need for transformation in general.
In those things has led us, a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and for the digital transformation of the public recording public asked me, why don't you help space for a couple of years?
We thought, we reflected the payment with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my boss, Jeff Besos.
To make a brief decision, I decided to apply a methodology of choice, in detail "Don't regret," of the non-penting year, I try to find it and I can't, or I try to not so much.
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years.
A welcome...
[Inglese] Oh, manzone.
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
I would mentally tell the chottingism and the bureaucracy, people would ask me, "But what about this disaster, and I did not expect, obviously?"
Butoscienticism often has to do with cinism, that throws a certain mentality, you never see it, obviously you do it because you say it, I feel many of this kind.
In reality, our country lack a lot of sense of common good.
about doing things because I thought of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, like an acute commissioner, and I say this because it's the brutal title, my children gave me a revolution from the beginning of an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to assume some people from the public administration list.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems inside don't turn into each other, we want to try to transform them with people who are out there, where the fact that we don't know the public administration?
It's a sign.
And not a Billiti bathroom, it's an advantage and it's not an advantage. So, sustainably, we created a small team, I said 25 people, a number.
Not big, but neither too small, technological expectations around 80% of 20% are expected to make giants, legal ones.
Docnatives of communication.
As you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't write what we think will happen.
In this way we want to bring such feelings, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
Surther times there is a compassion, likely, much less than what you see.
How do I keep you?
So I got into the idea, but how can I invite someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photographer in Bella's mind that in the 1947 she caught all the United States, who had given her phone children, all the United States, in this sport, a massive business.
I need infrastructure investments.
We've created the vision of the country's operative system, a series of fundamental components about which building the most basic, efficient for citizens, public management and companies.
Through innovative digital products.
Very well in documentation, it's lacrime and blood.
I've continued in my place, field of warmth in salt, but it's the American future, if I equivocate it.
And I continued, we will also find many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it is an easy prediction.
But we must learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many will say, "Don't understand how public administration works."
They've already told us many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
And I keep, we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be cinic and prejudice.
The criteria of the first group will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and there are many treatments.
The one in the second type, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the bicycle as a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is our problem: to motivate things that don't work.
(Audience) Yes!
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the carpet of Time magazine.
Here's it.
So, despite having tried to memorize the most possible agent of the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of those surely, at least one hundred them decisively qualified, we've used digital tourists for collochi, an app that's called Jazz, we've put it in Beth in the edge of the Govern.
We did a math test and a mathematical test, in the technological part, the team gathered the critical mass nearby, so there are seven people in genius, now we are a little more popular, and they immediately started operating, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we're talking about hydraulics.
These are the tubes of public recording, some of us can connect because the big problem ...
What is it?
The systems, the processes, the applications, whatever that should be interconnected is silos and it doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their data, their suffering and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
And it spends the shared code of the public recording.
The software manager, of course, is to do so much activity in management project.
So many legal activities ...
But we can't also get the following: to do Pia's services, in time you have to make them improve the current environment, doing more simple things.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your thesis you can't do the right.
(Audience): Yes.
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we wrote, in these months, the piano tends to public recording, we did together with the help, other people who helped us, what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in recording?
And for the lab there's one thing, exists.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole has stigmatized the decrease of the present that it is minister, digital transformation is a state priority, the trendial piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public recording, the life of citizens, particularly the piano.
It has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, and especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
What is this, the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
It's revealing the technological rules and the possibilities of three widespread wages and connections to other norms in other regulations, and at some point there are quite shocking technological rules, pretty incomprehensible: unfortunately we can't abuse these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: so the trendal piano has put its hands on the technological profiles of you understand it, and has put its way to where we can.
Talking to administrators, making us give feedback, documentary about reddox, so that the administrators themselves, the technological assistance methods, software and wds can do.
Let's do it.
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the population platforms, the digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in spontaneously all the activity of the recording public, and the more they will be.
The digital payment is one: electronic card, an interactive sign, a trap, the digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
Metteresto, technologically, all the data of your citizens that at this time are around 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in a single database, synchronize.
Out of the data they talk about, they're all synchronized and they talk about the rest of the administration applications: when I come across a community and I must use it.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago we made an Akaton Seria.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
It was done in 25 Italian cities, San Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from the technological point of view, like from the state.
All of this builds, and we're talking about sustainability and replicaability in the beautiful space of an E.T, where I witnessed, all documentary, and all the code, but more and more, applications.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what should be, maybe not.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that basically don't get limited to make an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it's good for kids to be composed, to disappoint me, this might be, for example, and it's one of those things which is shortly broken.
When we'll launch Alsa version, Alfa, it's called digital citizenship.
You have the phone, smartphone, you have the digital identity, you have data the electronic identity card, Nepiere.
It's already functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction between citizens and public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because work is really doing it, but it's different in this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years has written an uncertainty the world that has been around 150 years.
We waited for many people to talk about what they think could happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
But a country where reading and recognizing and promises the right to innovate, hoping to embrace it.
A country wants to offer technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine in the end a country where to work for public administration is an eye, where the best humans do to work in public research centers, that are green and proper centers of eccellence and innovation.
What do they bring development to the country?
Then, it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this technological process policies are really many and maybe many of them.
But if I don't have a dream about which we can hardly be able to do things.
Before I finish, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Take the chance to do it."
[Yes!]
And here it served somewhere in this theater, among the other, to this point, but it is easier, and I managed to explain what I was doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Digital Transformation, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Anything.
(Laughter) DG: Bouh!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
And if you wanted information about us, our site and our social issues, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) (Music) [Music de bajofound] [Music de bajofound] [Music de bajofound] [How can we do?]
But what if I had the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
What would you change?
(Laughter) Do you want to change, raise your hand to change work, your boss and your employees?
You're afraid, you're keeping Ever that Education, because behind the I know it's, then raise your hand those who will change some of your body, maybe you lose some threads.
Or maybe you won in muscles?
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom: raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want.
I was sure everyone would be over there.
Or maybe you are one of the ones who will change partner?
(Sounds) (Laughter)
Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't want to change our partners, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have one more united family, but my parents were not separated.
(Audience) Yes!
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
On the twice, I felt the most complex professors, they seemed to me all eyebrows and I reflected in music, here the great voices to make the test room.
I would have wanted to work at university, but I found myself with the difficulties of accessing the job market, so the first part of my life, I spent it fighting and lotting to try to understand how to change things that didn't work for me right now.
What other people thought about me has the biggest economical manovers, the interpersonal relationships with characteristics that I have acquired the end of birth.
When am I a psychologist?
Instead, I researched other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefits, but since most of the cases were the only three signs to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up maintaining their problems in life.
(Laughter)
The strategy, today, the broader, is to get lamented.
We remember that there's crisis, there's no job, there's traffic, stressed, that I'd have done it differently, we'd regret it because there's no treatment.
I know a lot of people who go to the table and the problem is that if they conceive mental space, this paralyszes you.
Typnotize and displayed at home mankets.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, who wasn't doing anything else to get bothered, from when I started to talk, to when I stopped to return home.
She started lamenting the triumphy, that she left her, then from the girl with whom she translated her, so that she didn't have a job, the ultimate Christmas of the government that didn't help her, felt valuable, abilities, and here it was the mind.
She had completely colonized all her daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a little the big temptation, because with a small effort you can obtain a great result.
But beware.
You can lament yourself in the night or day, on the streets or with friends, at the high voice or in your mind, can you remember something that already happened or something that maybe a Sunday could happen?
And you can lie to your tea, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you're forced to disappoint you hardly have something around you.
It will change, older, there's no other way to pay more attention to what hurts you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as adults, is that of lamenting.
Suppose that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Just to the magnifying glass.
Another verytoned strategy, when things are stretching, is that of imporciation, it requires our necessity.
But based on this mentality there is a growing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work.
It's enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being.
What surrounds us, doesn't you like bare?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
Now, you feel a bit dirty, but why can you never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it easy?
Your wife breaks you with strength.
In the fresh, let's get all the risks in the palm.
Your child doesn't listen to you, please.
And too big we couldn't mention it, send it to the psychologist, we are here on this one, on the other hand.
My vocation, the choice for this, to make the world around you fill up the perfection.
What about your demands?
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is...
The relationships of coppy.
(Laughter)
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I wasn't doing anything else, that listening to what, according to the other, I would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
And he says: "Yes."
It's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in the kinds, and then it's a classicone, and it's not, you know you don't realize all the things I do for you, and it doesn't, you know you don't realize all the things I do for you.
"Your."
And because we need to show all the line of equity of others, we need to make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old, but instead of picking up the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them, if the strategy is privileged.
When things don't leave as you wish, that of imporing your necessity and waiting for others to change as a result.
And we thought about a couple of times, because you'll have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
(Audience) Yes!
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there's no way a tool to take the forehead, put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
That's not the case.
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the merce of altruistic needs.
(Laughter) I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went to the roof that he was openly driven by confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned some important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, he never learned to say no.
The things that didn't care about them, didn't learn the things that didn't care about them.
To say no to the relationships that were looking for it, there was any social condition, and old one of them was one of the ones that had all the media time, but in this way where they were going to finish their needs, their desires, and their ambitions were always under the fear of facing conflict and the need to acknowledging all of them.
It's the strategy that privileges when things don't go as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
(Audience) Yes!
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, you'll finish to disrupt them.
To improve, to impose your needs or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in the long run, in my life, has abused.
But I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school I was working for, he called me and said, "Now Zuccelli, here for her, there's no place, it's pleased to keep the collapse with us, to accept a disturb.
And he showed me a far away, expected place, hesitated for the most, besides, I would have to go there to do a job that I didn't even have to do with all that I had studied until then.
And I've heard about dying, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change, adopt, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others ...
It's changing oneself, if I changed.
Also, the others would have to follow, change, change.
And if I turned into a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, the primary school wouldn't have sent me by, if I had done it, things wouldn't harm me more than that, but perhaps I would have gone away, even before the immigration.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
But why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
In the places, how to do things?
that they don't leave as a path.
Receive yourself as a cause of things that are not going to happen.
This is our challenge.
But if you haven't ever had a job at the crisis, you've been exposing the units to your disposal.
And I'll be alone, and help, confront something too big, and I'd like to say, "Let's get the crisis, what do you want to do?"
But if instead you leave yourself, you think of being perfect, that maybe there's a marginal of change, that then improved, then you open your doors in front of you, because it defines your responsibility, the speaker, you can always learn a new language, read books, go to chores to acquire new abilities, or consolidate those you already have, you can work to become a journal.
But because life is from those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
(Laughter) If inside the coppy, things don't go well, do you think there's the other side to where to take the first step?
It is sending them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today to make your best newspaper, then things change, but they don't change in the case, but they change because you know you've changed, before you go to the research of your books?
Now he sees the research of his needs.
And then I tried to operate to satisfy them.
And in this way it creates a mental space inside which we can take care of each other instead of making the war.
Then I ask myself to understand if you are one of those people.
It's with everyone, and they always have to say yes: one of those people I call, let me lose my term, prostitute and relational.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose meaning and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them.
Then the game becomes something, inside of which you can become a tennis standard, and start working on me, considering the cause of things that weren't going like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to invest in being a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value to their lives.
But, friends, I met a couple of...
So we'll have some problems to do.
Stereots, prejudices, obsession is the doctor of the mates, homicile is the doctor of the debts, but had to talk to a friend, but went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
I would have had to get lamented or not to explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
No, I had to.
To learn how to speak a language that was not happening, as closer to people, I had to learn how to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs?
Instead of having mine.
And as time went by, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
That's it.
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I recorded a video that I wrote on YouTube where I spoke about psychology, here in the channel capabilities to pick up the company, because they might be told...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that in 1974, I'm in 1979, revealing psychology in Italy, is my magazine, and what left me more than anything was recognized that the bonds at the beginning, a bit strange, came back ...
So I'd like to leave you with it.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbia, they've been read to the Vice President of Ornesi Colcht.
There are dreams.
[Inglese]: Yes.
Well, don't become real because, fortunately, or because you had that.
The story you have to have is that which you can hold and carry on, those who don't know how to build and you need to discuss, because guilt should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
That's it.
What if there's something I learned from all this journey that helps me?
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For this reason, I've asked you a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't work like you?
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
(Laughter) Well, in chiusure, I'd like to leave you with a gift, much less proven, it's a small question that I personally was very useful and based on logic that in order to produce great changes you have to focus on so many things.
But what's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the direct?
It's an ambite.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
And that's it, you've got the keys of the freel that comes to today.
The ugly to asso, left the pullman, right?
I see where I put the packs, "Fedemma, martians are the providers."
I've made it, but I've knocked on her feet that it's a mutation.
Offite when I arrived to my mother, do you know what?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And I want this time to take it by myself, here.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
So, of diverse and diverse abilities.
The percussions are so fast, so immediately, they take up the distances and join the battles.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
His kids, I see them, I see, mature, fear, my own.
I saw him growing.
Our provides were marriage, the mariday was the day of providing, where this room was entered at the Andreoli School.
They were picking up the first bidonies, he was together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become a group marathon, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical sights and saw the first ones, the first weddings in the fire.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012 the beloved world came across.
It's the true meaning of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I said, the cases were no more accessible.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
On the other hand, every Friday was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
The endless cake and the rocks.
Have we done it?
Luckily, we all found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manifes, of military purposes.
Within that tunnel ...
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth that washed, to find a smile.
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
There, inside, we've built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
They became the shelves, the tubes that became...
From tools constructed and combined with ping pong roots, to take out bills with big and houses, shoot.
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
(Laughter)
That's where our first spettacol was born.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we stayed, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We started building the first spettacol, the white man.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together as a white of magnifying glass.
After that, after we did it...
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also have a moment from our land.
to breathe for a moment.
After the year, we cracked, this marine demonstration, immediately after...
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought that a tone could change our lives.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
And the minutes are coming to me?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
(Audience): Yes.
150 concerts in return to education.
The dove of the first magician?
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
Is it the kindergarten stage?
We haven't really done so many.
And they also say twice aside, because this is exactly true.
It's exactly the life's circumstances, the fatal, the sudden, but also the freshness.
What are there so many possibilities and future?
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
What is there still so much?
Doing it, thank you all (Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.

Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until I've been asked what has happened in the last 250 years.
Well, I'm ...
250 years very important that changed our history radically, and that we live nowadays, we talk about social innovation and my question: "What is this social innovation?"
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
But this is the digital metaphor: we all carry ads, close to us, an event, I believe almost everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that has been extraordinary for those 250 years, it's the phone, and the computer belongs, but it's an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution that we are living today.
But let's understand, then, what has happened in these 250 years, which ones flood?
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet, the broadcast on the Internet, we considered it an iron.
What was my studies?
I'm about books in school, but it wasn't only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we've gotten a high debate.
I'm an immense boss, for example, because we have the steam motorcycle.
And the vapore mask is not only a vapore mask, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored, and it became much faster, the anticipation of carbon, and it started to change the modalities, but it didn't make it.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
The scoppy motor, because it's also a Toscanican invention and Italian invention, the motorcycle is scored in windshield, we also need the scoppy motorcycle.
We need, for example, the automobility industry.
Actually, it was used before the naval industry, because motorcycle was a motorcycle that could not go from far away, when I was able to understand how to remove that belt and get it off the belly and obtain that belt that developed the automobility industry, and all that has been derived.
But not just that.
And in the Industrial Revolution, we are still advisors, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, from one part to the other of the world, always smaller than we knew.
But it's also what permits us, and it has taught us, to the deposit of the caves ...
With the sea, and yes, because then you can see the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what we did, we interrupted everything.
No, we went on going on caves under the sea, and we were around 1858, the first cave to give a storic dimension was taken from many places between Mexico and articulated art, not only two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave went there.
But that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome.
only 1877.
Another invention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
In Europe the travel of Santa Radagonda was built, where the Rinascente Milano is now Rinascente. There, a while in 1873 was built the first electrical and continental power plant.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was illuminated.
A part of our history has swimmed right there.
But let's move forward, we try to get a bit longer rooms, and we arrive in 1950.
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important events and even important emotions from a cultural disartistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never happened before in the past history: the computer, the sidewalks.
The school designer who, in the beginning of the 50s, could be in a stance like this, and had marriage functions, just made the calculus quickly.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, he decided to open these landmares' releases, but he didn't know why they took off all the land, but endless, because they hadn't known, but in those 50 years of the Internet revolution had happened something else.
These rots called ARPA, ARPANET, the network.
They became and began to be the World Web, which we know.
A system diffused, orchontal, non-archical, extremely captured, is able to bring information to collect information to generate information, in 1981 only 300 computers connected to the Internet, in 1995 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
So, when the mécanical strength, which was, as to say, replaced, which was introduced to the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
And the Internet had the ocean that if we started to live the ocean that we lived now, that we are living now.
And this is an industrial process that tells us that what's new, progressively, does what's old, because it needs to take a space, and we'll see better as well, but this is the story that belongs a little more to what makes a reflection, tries to accompany it.
When, little by little, I haven't done the Italians yet.
Minister Minghetti, put an end to Inghetti, established that 27th century of the judge is correct, the payment is public dependent.
And from 27 of the successive months after this happened, in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most of all, it has transformed the economic power of the power of production of goods and goods in the power of producing of the U.
Well, the denaro.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the emergency to go and sponsor every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to keep in a massive way, a structured way, in a healthy way, in a quantity of food.
So there's the chance, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the emergence of everyday life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us, in the time, as we said, the computer arrived and arrived on the internet, and there's a number that has characterized these years, there's an element that we can define as the qualificator of these years: speed.
In the past 250 years, we didn't have speeds as we are today, we do things very fast, and we move fast the speed of the rivers, the speed of movements, the speed of our thoughts, which is not the detail of the thought, but we are very fast.
But until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story of understanding the messages from one section to another and individuating some date that are not necessarily zero.
1900, 1900, 2001, when we can say it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that significantly indicate the passing of one horizon from 2001 and 2008.
First of all.
The American economy started to slow down.
There are also Torri Gemelli, and therefore something, in balance, that seemed lonely, we are correct to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
Instead, there were Europeans who were to fail, Greece was already overwhelming, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, something changed.
But what has changed has changed the economical paradigm, couldn't we?
We weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis.
Because, effectively, if it was verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do everything?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would happen: we were the most of them, but above all, there are all the companies that came after 2011, to tend, to look at these companies, these companies have credible multinationals.
Why have these companies done, don't they innovate?
They were inventing something that was not before, but they started doing what we've always done, buy, travel, learn, learn in a different way, in a more efficient way.
And the adventure, the idea that is often denied, and so much and little, not yet something, according to human abilities, human resources, abilities to heal, to be disconnected from advanced competitions and abilities based on what allows us to flow.
There are informational systems, digital systems, and advances that allow us to develop.
A third factory that we should look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The public administration system: we immediately get the field of some ambiguity, and we keep both important and most of all a good news: everyone, every five element is growing.
I'm all five elements that are growing up, at a speed of growth completely athetic until two years ago, so we've been attending European countries and this is a good news.
As long as we put connectivity, we said 11 points out, but, objectively, we just need to look at the newspapers, and see that we're growing fast and competitive very important, the use of the Internet, frankly we're really a few seconds.
Actually, there is a very profound change that is leading to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to watch with great attention that will be key for our future of countries and are the abilities and digital inclusion in the productive factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country: we have two engines, the first motorcycle.
It's what happened most in the '50s, and it's the first medals.
Longe from being, the small printed media.
Something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't require the biggest multinationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change: they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
They can do something extraordinary, "Made in Italy," they have a quality, an eccellence in the production of service in the product, which is quite united in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, abilities inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve.
An interaction of the market in an extraordinary way, generating ricks for all the thesis around you: a patrimony of nature, nature, nature, and its cultural artistic heritage, and this is the first assess we have, the first great motorbike that the hospital, and its cultural artistic heritage.
But can tourists only visit three cities?
USA started, and then they started again.
I believe that this is the biggest assurance we can do to our Italy, but the ricks of these three cities don't do, maybe, we've started to start, but we're speed to regain, to include this heritage within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it to the wrong, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our country, thanks.
(Music)
(Applause) The reason I'll talk about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word.
What to unify?
And all of this?
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
I opened my hair.
According to you, in the past...
15, 20 years, let's say, in the 21st century: inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens have increased or decreased.
But I believe that most of you would answer:
They're increased: if you go to journalists, maybe you'll add the precious aggressive, they've increased exponentially.
S: Yes, it's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be, too.
I've been asking myself these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the results of video.
I was prepared with my colleagues, a rappor.
We know about inequality, from when they are data, that is sustainablely from 1960.
For the vast majority of countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of the citizens of the world, as you can see, it was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the start.
By the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated now we're at the storic mining.
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
We have a tendency to disguise in decrescent.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible letture is to say: we've buried a complete alcohol, because we've continued to talk about years of increase in inequality as much as it seems.
The data doesn't support our senses.
And there are, surely, in this letting go, but we could also ask ourselves another question, and if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are myself.
Let's move?
The feeling wasn't wrong, but the idea of inequality in which ...
We reason.
Can you imagine that?
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality, what we try to say about inequality.
Maybe the thing of inequality actually requires some rhythm.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And we also moved to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
That was Cambridge, a speech came out in front of me.
To a public of students, a speech was then famous with the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren, in that occasion, Keynes forms two professors.
The first one says.
It was a seventh, the product.
(Laughter) Some time I'm working, they'll be...
Otto times that of today, that of 1928.
And this exchange, indeed, is realised, because if you're about to engage.
Refugements of the storage of the economy?
Effectively, in most society, we have an increase in productivity over 100 years, as well as...
Of course, twelve times, in some 15 occasions, so this prophecy was realised, but from this prophecy Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, that is, that humanity has been achieved.
Then, little by little, that's where you can say, little to 100 years, it would be found with a huge quantity.
With free time, it would have gone to...
Lavoring less?
She also said to her to work on everybody, and when she told her that she didn't want much less, she wanted a week of 15 hours of work.
I have a couple of three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
Well, well, well!
Apparently, this second trust didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't work all, and it doesn't look like we work three hours a day.
But me ...
Let's notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says that we will all live, it's certainly false, but the first part...
We will remember much less, we will work three hours a day: we are sure that it's not made anywhere, we can see what happened in Italy.
This one...
The curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
What is an average Italian?
It determines work throughout your life.
Your life naturally, potentially working, meaning for 15 years, then ...
We are able to do a job, and if we keep this trajectory, Keynesi's teacher, actually, is done.
Because we reached the beginning of Novecent, almost 40% of the time of our lives.
to work?
And now?
We call it around 16%, and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
Have you done that?
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood, we already installed in Italy.
Naturally?
If this has happened, there are reasons too.
Have you and if you want a banana, for example, the anguish is enormously aligned.
Because we die a lot after life expectancy and those who grew up from something like 27 years from the beginning to the year 2000, there is another reason, which is also very positive, and other marginal, if you want, our children often study a long time.
We've also been studying for 25 and 30 years, so young people are launched.
But there is a reason, maybe more fundamental, why?
Our quote of time?
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
This is rich for this occasion.
And this series of dramatic stories, because it makes you see.
Why?
In the beginning of the seventh, in the whole monarchical ocean.
First of the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 scary missions, but from 1968 and we've accepted one year.
The occupation rate has always been lower than 50%.
Then, what about a pile of occupation?
It includes 50 percent.
What does that mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income.
I'm more workers.
In front of this?
Farming action: can we also have a reaction?
It's enthusiastic and says, "But this?
And beauty progress is modernity.
Things have been like this, because we can't allow it.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States.
And then we see the confront?
Thank you.
In Italy.
Testing units.
This is the storic series of time.
I have dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States is on its own, up to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while we make crops.
But even more impressive is the storic number of the occupation rate.
Because here we see.
Which has even an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general trend of the occupation rate in the United States.
Now, in our case, we have a situation.
Riduation.
at the occupation rate.
But then that?
"It's a pathology."
It's not normal.
Why?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most people live in a condition that I defined -
Dipendence in parassity, in addition, because depending on the subject to your wisdom.
This can also be a family member, the State.
But would it stop, why do I consume?
I have the available income without working.
I was a friend who did theater's work when I found these results.
We were at the scene and I asked them.
How did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parassitary dependence, and you know what answered to me?
With Epopopotentus and lucieline.
It's on the backs of Epoto, but it's called buffago, some say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The buffer, or the buffaca on thepotam, or on the other great mammals, these whales also live on the roots, on the bufts, we have this film.
Why will it be there for some seconds in which you see?
- Yes.
The animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
By taking advantage of the resources that ...
The buffler supplies, which are insetti, larvae, ze that everything that host on the golden dorsis, isn't clearly clear if the hat is infastated by the hell.
Anyone.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not a psychologist, I'm a sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
Another thing is how can we define a situation like this, how do we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers?
It's a minority of producers, how do we define a society in which ...
There is this kind of improductive consumption that I've been told before, but is this the signal society?
Society, signals, like feudal society in which there is blindness.
What has traveled to live without working?
(Laughter) But naturally, it's not enough: we must add a qualification: this is, indeed, a conviction.
That it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
(Laughter)
Because consumers are more than producers.
In the signorious, simple, classic society, we have the sign and the serves of the grey that they produce for him, in society.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission in a massive society.
Things are a bit more complicated: ladies, I've become many.
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greego Dubezson, a great psychologist anthropologist, that would define a relationship of damages, let's see why.
The relationship?
The buffer with the hypothesomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food that is there.
At the bottom of the hippopotomo, the red thinth indicates an advantage.
And also from the view of the producers, we came back to a green light, a green light, the Epopopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need a buffaco.
But in some way, it's a lack of obligation, how are we?
In terms of color we keep, because we can't, we can'tpower them, not feed the animals we live.
We see our homes, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of lawy, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
That's it?
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
The question I had made talking about Keynes: today, perhaps, the only inequality and inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very essential in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools.
In the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent coherent concentration of genius, which is the tool in which inequality is measured, we can apply it to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two workers.
And the position of the adult, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the position of the year is ...
And it's scared.
In the last week, in the towel, together?
"So, Turchia?"
The country in which the desigualdad reaches the mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we will probably be the palm of this grader, the best situation, that of the New Year.
With the United States messes in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
According to the inequality of access to work in Italy, they've always measured that efficient decent, you can see something that matches, that inequality is minimum during monarchical age, especially under the fast, there are 7 million pairs of jobs in more than our families than the one in which we live in.
You would accept it.
Million euro per month, and in addition, there were around 12,000 euro per month.
The year.
And our State would have 15 billion euros as well as health and school put together, more or less in Italy, but here, in conclusion, there is one but.
What?
We also had the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution: "School is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country."
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
That's why.
Or we change things.
And we create the six million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a beer.
Thank you. (Applause)
