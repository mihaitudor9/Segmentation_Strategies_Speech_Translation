In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Forum Fortiching Learning, which was sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, the TCinchiro was born.
The motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the confronts of the students and my ability to create environments of less formal data, more reassuring data.
Let's imagine that this is a big university class.
When I arrived in class, the first ten minutes, when the students arrive and are seven, I start with my computer recording and put up a classical music.
In this sense, this is the first step to create data environments, fewer disabled forms, and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used by the end of old age: storytelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to bring knowledge to the students.
And this is precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing a topic on the spot of everyone already: artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
Second World War: UK, Blece and Park, a residence northern Londra.
There was a young thirty years old, Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's the Cambridge's College and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a special and enigma machine.
It was commonly a machine to write: the digital operator of tastes, but, older than stealing on paper, letters, I think of staying other letters, according to an impoted code basically under the machine.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper was in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main characters in Blece Park, the one you can see behind, in order to decipher these trees written by youredes.
For this invention you think that the war is over with two years old, saving many human beings.
The lantness continuous, after the war, to make its logical ricks, and is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, an article on the Revista Mend, "Computing Maschines and Intelligence," where Twing test proposes.
The question behind the testing is a very precise: can machines think?
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "Mishing game," the game of training.
I want to explain.
Suppose we are a person here who tells the computer to ask questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a operator or a operator.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P, if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language, the question that comes from the person.
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
You have to learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach: it's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts at the moment they get, or we try to modify our thoughts at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
"Socrates" and a man: "Socrate and mortal."
This is a deductive argument: it has two premises for leaders, it has a verified conclusion.
That's where the deductive logic is born.
According to the idea of the rules of the thought, we try to build endless claims and transfer them to a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people, entity, have to set goals, and know how to bring them to the end, must adapt to it, must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects.
By formulating Turing's quote, a machine can think.
We can say: we can create a machine, an artificial agent, in order to think, toibish intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the aim of creating artificial and intelligent integrity.
Your phone is an accent.
In both the construction of artificial entities is trying to understand intelligence, as a psychological construction.
Once we have a lot of knowledge about this, we try to build artificial, intelligent, and supported humanities, it's a cycle.
But let's see today if machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five lessons to classify artificial agencies, according to their abilities: we have human, human beings, and, in fact, we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you another example.
Eight managers are the agents that benefit better than all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that solve the Rubik cube, already with four strengths in the best way, playing a sad one.
For some years, a young man has been returning the original sum of Rubik's cube, it has been resolved in 4.73 seconds.
Any months have created an agent, a robot that could resolve zero-63 seconds.
We have sovraumatic agents that fit better than all people, for example, in the game of the scenarios, in the game of the scarcess.
But what year ago the green market camp, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who act almost like all people, for example in the Pker Texano's game, answer questions of the question.
We have human beings that act almost like all people, in cognitive activities like the cultural words, or the magic classification.
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects, the recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, the translation of one language to the other.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today can't do, for example, it's a disambition: we're talking about the fridge like mine, or we're talking about the Mark of Apple Corporation.
One thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
Now let's talk about the future, the machines will think.
But since a year ago, in America, this concept was introduced by the name of technological monolarity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest aspects of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a facial line that indicates intelligence with a sponcial floor.
This settlement follows the predict in the wall's law, in which computational complessity, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, which is faded for two years and in quadruplicates every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to use this computerlessness to emulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
