(Applause) Are you there?
Then, the story begins with the little kid, Riciolino, I'm sorry, now this thing doesn't ask me anymore, because they became big, but I don't, you know that until some time my two words appeared so far away, and so the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
The words were fat enough to get out, they were stuck in their pockets: if you've spent the years, the child becomes a child, but he has a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, and so much as he proves to find psychologists, all the brave professionals, but no one can give up this inner one.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, there was a little girl called Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
You'll ask a child, what happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
And then the child thought, "I'm not interested.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
(Laughter) Anyway, it was still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor, then he became an informatical engineer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, and in the forest of his country, they were attending a big party with a dove and a microphone in the middle, now you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble, but the desire for this young man to try the battles he had written, the fights with them was too big, and he didn't think about it, salty the barbecue, and said, "Salva todos, they're an informatical engineer, you think they're so, people laugh, and he was happy because the words used fluid, in the air."
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That this young man, at that time, was that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
(Laughter) Well, at this point, one of my teachers would have asked me and would have said, "Yes, mom, we've understood you are you," but they were laughing with him, but the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, but you'll forget to say about the power.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
And one thing, a while ago, I'm talking about my disabilities and they draw out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met, who became part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
But how do we respect all the stories?
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
But for those who are a father or are they becoming a genius?
Generating disability.
Well, that's it.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
It's trisomy 21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) The doctor, subsequent, sign, maybe he didn't understand, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
It's a feminine.
And then I, as a matter of qualma, pork, misery, we don't even know if we were able to make a mask from nyle, but the shadows ... the dotted we have given the head to the doctor, because ... (Laughter) Thank you.
We keep moving much about this, but I assure you that it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our life is truly wonderful that it has become all the best people, it has become the best of their suffering, and all the people who, in some way, find, after a few months, and if this is not potential.
(Laughter) And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use it, but I know a little bit of time ago, Francesca, came home and said, "You know that they use a chromosome more, one X plus, I don't know, I'll give you an example, you have a TED talk."
You built a small X.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because you, today, to meet TED, talk to people, you've made a little bit of fat, here's the invitation to make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life, both personal, but also some people around you, a very small advertisement.
(Applause)
In this path, we can lose, because our tendency is always the one to give us a grader on, a little underwater, here, to wake up the eyes, you have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me to often lose, in this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability, so I don't have to try to trace disabilities.
In your life, to enroll them, and most of all.
And remember that the pairs.
that you can look at the face, they can truly be brave, thanks to your heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like maoce, who sees, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And I understood what my mission in the world was, in fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds, nor a romantic disorder, as some people gave us before, but in an ortag, it worked well, it could go further, while you had an ortags, to realize how much it occurs every day, how much it takes a be, thanks to a traffic, and that is what happened to me, will be the food.
But why food?
food?
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices of each day are usually part of our daily environmental impact, if we want to translate it with an index we could talk, for us, for our family, every single day.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
(Laughter) My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and that's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what our memory is about food.
Another thing of consumers also is to optimize consumers, and especially the way in which we compose the bact every day, theattoo, so, what are we, effectively, bringing it to the cake?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the march of the thread, of the rejects, of what we usually use via, and here in front you have a small example of scary, so the less noble part is in average to less 50% of the raw materials, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us a cut, a cake.
Now, when we were in war, OK, I can give beneficial interests, for example, zucca -- I really love it because, much better than breastfeeding, an incredible consistence -- and, for example, zucia -- another very practical example -- you take a glass, because, maybe, if you don't like a glass, you don't like a glass, you compute something you comply, you compare, and that you compare more than another, that you can stop, because, for example, it can be done, but it's another vast example, but it's not a vast, because it's a glass, like this, it's a glass, it's an example.
There is also a protein food, which is absolutely environmental in our health, but also in terms of sponsorship, public policy, and that, furthermore, we can nourish, of vegetables scars, maybe not the ones that will carry to the store, but that are with me today, in the middle of the store, and that, even more likely, to protect, that all of us, we might have a few less proteins in the zero.
I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be improved, there was more food consumers of lumps, about 35 years ago a law has prevented us from collecting them, not only for food use, but also because they are used for the cosmos and for other users, but it's a food that also requires to add a highly delicate taste, enough to know how to do it.
That's how simple, but I'm a very optimistic and stupid person, the French seats or richer a stranger, so united to me became revolutionary, perhaps the next year if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they would never eat them, and especially for our happiness and our planet.
I've brought two data with me: now let's play, you'll launch the side of ten gangs, you came to this game, undertake an equal or largest number of mine: one has a common data with six gangs, you fell from one to the other, the other has gone with ten gangs, I'll leave you.
One possible approach is based on the experiences, and for this, four years ago, I started my doctorate in the method of Monte Carlo, a pure mathematician, reminded the Monte Carlo method, a little elegant, at five, with a little of peace, and a thousand times, realizing that the provedity of victory approaches 7 or 8 times to every victory.
There's the last thing I want to share with you: for the first lesson of studies I did, I began to teach math and English, and then a moment to decide my next step, in which I hadn't prepared for the first week of doctoring, for the first lesson I did, he taught me, and to give you a content teacher, I started to continue, and then, to make you understand with all my students, my title, my first journey, which I was given to me that I was a decisive decision, my decision, and then I learnt how to do something, and after that, I learnt how to do something, I learned from passion, passion, passion for what I learned, passion for me, passion, passion for me, passion for what I learned, passion, passion for me, passion, passion for what I did.
In the end, an ultimate student, I just want to leave you with, I'm satisfied, well, I was fine of the microphone, my three levels to talk, it seems nice, maybe I'm looking for the words right, it approaches me, another guy in the front row has collected everything that can expect in a scheman.
So, this is what I want to tell you: I'm only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart, and I think that maybe, thanks to this reason, when your mind in motion, your heart beats strong inside the breast.
And so, Dario à Mosca, in Trento, we held the research, we put our support on the basis of Bafco, they became public publishers, asking for our love to donate the world movement, and they start to make us grow down the bathrooms, we put together for wildlife salary programs, in November, for the first of November, and they start moving the dialogue and to prepare the world to sell.
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
CR: In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book.
It's like often a captain, while I read and while doing something, started to make me some of the others, started to listen to different conversations, there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It was a central theme, my colleagues were written in a very clear way: now we all face the change as if it were the most normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you have to do something, but in reality, when everyone approaches change, the first thing you have, is beyond fear.
I feel that in this change there are many people joining, there are many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to mix and feel far from the objective, feel your diversity, experiencing your diversity, feeling good, but now what can I do?
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know itself to practice, and the opportunity appears right now, instead of diversity, which is how to integrate?
All that has brought a different look, remember one day my daughter: Carola.
And a mom, we had a family of friends, boys, and at some point the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Of course, we are really three men," and says, "No, no, you are both of them, you are with mom?"
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
(Laughter) I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and this is the difficulty a little, but because if, on one hand, I want to create a culture of change, on the other, I need to create change leaders, that I've been working for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
Then, when I'm driving this birds, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States, writing in a paper, the word change, adding to this word change, I start a thinking that gives me in these words and forms a hatred of cake.
Kaching, which is actually a presa, is a bit of achievement that, in my opinion, clearly, this is a prosecutive of all personal personnel, a leader today of willing to know how to stay, must know how to take, but to be present and lead to change, to cake is an atom, and it is a creative of transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new element is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change, meaning in management, and what is happening is, instead of doing something else.
And then, the prosthesis, the change of perspectives, that I thought, but what I wanted to take this leap, to do things, to find roles that I make a project are paid for the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and in this way, there is a transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, but I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little bit the ability to dream, the transformation is that ...
Nobody is creative in their own way.
(Laughter) And finally, we don't talk more about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genius, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of a workshop, rather than communication, but creativity is something that everybody has, has amazed the environment in which you are.
(Laughter) And if that is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can integrate your creativity, simple, San morning we have started with a tunnel, brainstorming, and this is one of the tourists that allows you to fulfill your creativity, what you do with the divergent and convergent thinking, but this is not enough.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve that emotional part, that which is the fear of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first, here, to achieve the absence of being emotions and emotions, those forces, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that to do this.
It's not that you stay indifferent to the contents, and that's what they've done these reports, just to suffer in Italian field, certainly deserve marimetti to Rome, but at the same time even those, like the world's major standard company, for innovation, and is growing up to 67 percent.
They keep, as they say, inside, but they are not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the only difficulties today is in supporting the leader to identify that with their behaviors they can generate the environment.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can interact with each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not always the same amount of organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were achieved only in one way, on the other, but to lead the opportunity to do that, to explore new discoveries.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and, in the end, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Do I get involved in collecting creative spirit?
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, and it necessarily happens if you don't interact with the organization, even to reinvent the very customer relationship, because the prosthesis is completely changed.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigm, that is, to change the situation of being conscious.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way I look at people, I can find something that is not so wrong.
So the sense of attention we've seen in the video is, as to say, love is the volcano for the development of creative thinking, but this crappone clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to make physical spaces where all this is possible, but especially that of creating a mental space, that is to allow the permission to do things happen inside of you and then outside, so, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
(Sigh) We are about to land, to release our confidence belts.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance to see from above.
The most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcasting of the human.
The city.
And it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible that millions of people?
For thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that has gone back in time, in fact, this is Manchester, in 1845, was the biggest city and the most populated city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not the case, and in fact, in this city, it started what we've experienced the longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process is obviously the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They used to be strade, without leaves, without poverty.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And, of course, both write with the book, called "the path."
Last class operated in the city.
where cities were accused to be the cause of inequality, insecurity, poverty, all the bad guys in the world.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible, as to say.
A malign behavior.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of November, there were also tools to limit this phenomenon, Chiara probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics, you can see here behind, one thing.
The tremendousness that, maybe, some of you have heard about, that has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you have changed a lot at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who has even arrived to say and to pretend to imagine a centimeter of the city, what should happen in the future, here a house, with a trade.
It's a theater.
And then, let's imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about cities: a famous movie, a series of movies in the 80s traveled to New York, from Los Angeles, where Manhattan.
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence and iron, whiten by abandoning it, and maybe because you've seen the movie, you remember, becomes a prison where all the world's goal are launched by thealto and scanned forever.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all the processes, this was also for example a little lungh in 1845, there was a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution to all the big questions related to human beings.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability, confidence, economic development, job creation, the ability to create knowledge.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The foundations that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world, the first one.
It's the density, you see what my spallel, my picture from the upset of my city?
And the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can stay in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks and others who also ignore the name of the most famous calling.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare where billions of people, for one afternoon, have a carpet, a midday at home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Here's my idea: that the city, in the end, is scared, and somehow addressed as a solution?
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The vastness, the people, are all encouraged to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the product PIB, no, the city is a mechanism.
And the city works and resolves the greatest question of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, depending on individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as it has succeeded in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status, now we know all some cities, even in Italy, even bigger.
Why?
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that, right now, in some moments, or in some periods, they may be.
So we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to go through this virtuous mechanism.
I find tools for human containment, mechanisms and tools that develop development, and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and that they are not afraid.
The Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
To feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example is Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From these satellites and some relatives are evident, not all of us, but ...
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter, from man.
Together and this is my idea.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
And that, by going to see the city's maps, you can imagine the biggest urban stage in the world: 72 km of green, an orbital stage, that each day can be seen as an element of diversity and strength.
creating in the positive things of the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
To discuss the retirement of traffic, which is still invoid, before the lack of solution, of cities like the local.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have these spots in mind.
The second example is now that.
in a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called "Bon Aires," in Argentina, the capital, and it's been a quesit a few years ago.
What to do with this city in 2030 with all of the refugees, Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the perfect magnet of the whole nation, the place where everyone finds a chance, but this mechanism, which is the definition of the city I proposed to you, was somehow overwhelmed.
However, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation what was it?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
It limits development and instead with courage.
By separating the bass, with the same ability to believe in the power of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do development accelerate?
And that you can see here, behind, an intensity priest, that is, a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician,
The creation of spacies, pedestals or glasses, you can see this app.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, building up the piano.
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency but of the whole world and the creativity to get together.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
Suffering, that allow us to...
I believe that even more in this development is to accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
What spaces?
Diver and pedonals.
And these three strategies together focused on the development of Buenos Aires, knowing that the cities ...
I'm the solution to all the world, then, when?
Ancorates a time.
Stop.
And maybe choosing the position at the end, you will see it from the upset, this great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe?
You are willing to live in what I call, the section of the city.
The words are important, they put us in relation, form our thoughts, the words of our language.
They're extraordinary, they're evocating, they're full of stories of emotional vibrations, they're notebooks, they're evocating, they laugh with our history.
And you see beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceived, and again, I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about it in a high way.
In English, the provincial mixture, often dark, of English Italian words that, for a few years, was starting to become common, but it took a little long time.
And will I start to show you?
In Sweden, some Latin moves, at the UK at Londra University, and they show them with a big budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, Oxford.
In Chicago, in the United States.
Albert says "behave" in his insurance, not just "the university" or "being proud."
They tell you of themselves in Latin: "Fonda has a Latin motto, Parigi has a Latin motto, Canada has a Latin motto."
Kinslean, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: the American marine says, "Tell me, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, because I'm doing it so fast with Latin."
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could be, it's this one.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
On the other hand, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality?
And this ... (Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we have to say this: "Room, me and you, Wow, Mendyu," what is this amputation of Barça Lega, what is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each one, what are the five stalks high?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
(Laughter) But because, when we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there is no one who does what is required to settle their name, to move, from anywhere.
Just Doma.
But afterwards, you've got your feet, we'd like to embark on the total turning point (Applause)
But as soon as we started the curious and this one, with which we are Italian people in an insensite way, they don't like us, they don't like the anglophons, the thing - the Ministry of Benecuto - see how beautiful it is!
From Italian speaker, we're still Italian - I'm talking about it - the most romantic language in the opposite of "Roomy and you," stubbed by Ort, the most dominant language in the world, according to ten linguistic languages in the Sasso.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, "You're male."
Nevertheless.
That's it.
For example, the pizza has conquered the world keep on calling pizza.
One: here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map, selling hamburgers or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
So, if the whole world eats and says "Pizza", why we, here in Italy, drink "wine"?
Keat here: we eat food, we drink wai in Luca, there's nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote in the week of the Italian wine, they say, "well," (Laughter) because the restaurants from New York, the Belgians and the local officers who sell food and they say,
Wow!
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no longer that one time, (Laughter) but let me explain why I should call 'Let's give up food', and let's talk about fashion, this is what you write the Italian magazines of fashion.
Highteen colors as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
It's like they're made in our slide.
And the women we see in our mental births.
Why do you run?
But if it comes Donne, I'm not in the curves.
We're going to talk about publicity, old adertising, this is the publicity spread via a vecture of us in Spain and talks, Spanish: this is a pack of openings in France and French talks, this is the same payment.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if we perfect the union?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call us, the calls, this, "I'm on the Onse."
We are segregated, the radicies together in Cattitalian, like an engineering word, reunion, 60 percent of the 2012, we think they're 58, so we don't know English, we don't know how a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) And here we have to wait that the medical abilities of the sign that I've compiled the sign that I've compiled this model of the is beyond the linguistic abilities, and yet every day, for drugs and prediction, for conformism, because it's a model, because we're very vincial, we use a quantity of English words, not necessary.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
(Laughter) When I'd just say, we have to call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because then Yunit business is always "Pipoflanco" and "Genale."
(Laughter) The Internet and the e-mail talk not only about it in companies, but also in average, public recording, the government, and it required the speakers of the Giobatt's newspapers, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, we've made a house somewhat.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
(Laughter) That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea, I was in detail that I had to do something, communicate my partner, I have in mind two processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my office, to put a start on the internet to make sensibilization and activism about this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single thing, simply putting ourselves a bit of competition, communication, and waste, and a bit of energy: this appetition ...
who used to invite public records, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian.
And as a result, at first, the Academia of Cusca, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for a discovery discourse, but not what happened: in less than a month they signed, putting their names, with men of Dizzo, and in the last 70,000 people.
They signed stories of Italy, they filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spy that the workshops signedplenditious professionals and called pensioners, signed Italian people in the west saying, "What are you doing in our language?"
From Singapore, from Jerusalem, from Peduda, South Africa and North Africa, Canada, Canada, Australia, it's something with a movement: I've spent hours!
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
(Laughter) An Italian and an English speaker: "I know the best of an English, T-shirt," and we know that we ran for fashion, I got a bill of LISPR, but also a donation, we are not only a FUFA scan, because I studied Classic Liceo, but I have a job with economists.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but Italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
(Laughter) First of all, I started to let myself talk about our language decades, because I would never like to say, "Steen years is based on time."
(Applause) I'm from Dante, from Montal, from Caproni, Paese, Bebiangiardi, Bergada, I'm stubborn to feel relatives who don't know how to say about bugs in Table zone, but they rearrange Company's hat, and so happens, films because I don't believe that those who say "CUL is cool."
(Laughter) But why did I have recognized teachers and universities that say disappointed, instead of visualizing, "I'm filming, why don't I know the workshop?"
(Laughter) First of all, I want to understand what politicians say that ask my vote.
And then, when someone finally brings this initiative, I'm 85 years old, thanks to promotors, here, you can say, an extraordinary approach to transporate because in mass media, they traveled this thing from zero cost on the Internet and the winter amplified.
They talked about it together, grammares and serves on the Square of Republica, but the gathering with great applause, also in Italy Sea, and here it has talked about Wired, and this initiative is used in over 130 articles on Italian journals, with a transversal consensus in imaginable.
(Laughter) He didn't talk about Christian family, he has spoken today that behind him made a publishment: a transversality?
"Ca!"
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in interactions, it also touched me to put myself in the city, and on the roof of the Eastics was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lion.
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and our daily lives.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
I'll remind you of some reasons to do this: to open up, but the Indian aids us to understand each other and it's a fact of dismaking, because to make us understand a fact of dismaking: they don't want rules, they don't want to wear, they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, it's a factor of your emotion, we need to sell the spiral, bring it to the world, because it presents it, and know more lingue, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
(Laughter) In English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten it, so the one who talks better about it, and then he was called Leonardo.
In the first of the interventions of this newspaper, the resonator that defined himself "Homo Sanza Littere."
Because he was scratching in flat, in Italian.
It's always the structure, the way to decrease in the Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign to express one of our pecuriarities.
From its flessuosity.
From the great potential of our specifically Italian creativity, which is the ten in your mother language, and even if our linguistic view is used to approach some short term, why not?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fulfilling and that's charged by losing sense of what is required to an excess, of terminals, or of evil, why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history, our openness to the world, that passes from our words, thank you.
What does it mean to be a young Kerghiver, what happens when mom or dad or dad, or entered, but if that person, even to something that doesn't go and your mother or your father, to attend all that person about their needs, but what's behind these photos that you don't see?
If I ask you what has changed, what is the same, before telling you the dead part of the iceberg, I would like to take a step back, always rearranging from the beginning.
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed my hair straight away: a certain point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then crossing it, but what is the invisible in those photos?
What if I tell you that the health problem is a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, love, hatred that are strongly altered: fear, rage, sadness, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
But in addition to all this, the difficulty to focus, and also having to deal with practicing domestications, such as thesis, or addressing hungdine, there are the smallest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy, but in addition to this, you should have to manage windows and certain emergencies for which no one has prepared to do it.
(Laughter) Later, I also had to keep doing my life all the time, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another goal, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
Nowadays, in all the world, physical health and mental health, there's not even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom or dad will not be the answer of the world will be completely different, but if they ask and receive the most of the time not to receive a cure."
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the neglect, can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What was behind those photos that wasn't visible behind that smile, there was a crown that came to be automatically formed, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rab and tears, and to prevent me from getting rid of the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing the things of all my guetans.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
And you know why it happens, because our parents' stories with mental disorder are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me that we have in common, and that sometimes we are convinced of being one, that there is no other, that we've experienced the same things we've experienced, but the truth and the spark of this person to filter, for the first time, the light started to filter.
But it's one day that I thought of this project to a project that's called, like the mini guides, that I've written, and now we've managed to reach so many regions, from the open wave, with the students, with the youngsters, who were able to give a cope of these civil society, that have grown in a child, teenagers who don't know how to do it, to do it only when you're not even in cure, in cube, in cube, in cube, there's no space, there's never been, but there's never been any chance to do it, but to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it,
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
One of the positive characteristics that our parents' parents with mental disorder has is willing to change their scope and that's why I know that the boys will make them fulfill their desire, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open to us, and let's enter the light, thank you.
(Applause)
Aron Sfarz, when they dedicated a documentary last year, last year in 2014 the year encouraged by the Internet on-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an assignment in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and constructed in 15 years the creatures. We, at least, are involved in a process of content, are liberated licences to which he has collaborated with, for example, in Wikipedia's license.
A few years later, a small start-up started building something that co-founds something called reddit, becomes a millionaire, from one day to another; Aaron, honestly, didn't take so much money and famine, continues to do what has always done to build an Internet, Open Liberari, two digital libraries, which are literally saving the web, because it would go to Buduto, there are archives of digital memory.
(Laughter) What in ARON absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne says it himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 feeters, all the tasks of computer education, was going around with the capital of March, right at 16 years old.
Later, and this tells her brother in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn highly: he tells his mother that, at some point, she was staying there, and a Aaron had two and a half years, was seduced in the segelone and showed her the avenue on the fridge, that she had just caught her pile to calm.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all basic tools, but fundamental for banality, which means that power information, creative content, information is born from an extremely simple, but fundamental thing, that is to give access to information to people, that is to say, to compare a disabled person.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this ...
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So, if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so, fundamentally, they are made of words.
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
[A.DE.]
But you don't do this by yourself: if you make the world thinker, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become a singer act of eroism, but you become an act of collective construction.
(Laughter)
Around aproximadamente, in 2011 Aaronne is interested in this thing called Open HX, few great editors have the keys of power, scaring what scares isn't, which is scientific information.
It's interested in this subject, scratch this thing called Open Hux, Guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy; the first ones were power information.
[Yes!]
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
And ASBAI has taken care of it, not a hacker of this genius, it's probably not observed, it understands that your opportunity to do that Aaron's account.
An example: they want to give you an example to show all hackers out of the world that the world doesn't change with a pair of code.
(Laughter) That's it!
The aromine facts of a veracity and its technical persecution, for having scared hundreds of thousands of artists from traveling to the academic fishing, and it could do it, but not in this situation, and they are responded to 35 years, it spends millions of dolls in more or less than a terrorist.
Two years later, her first army, anon stood at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
(Audience) Yes!
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: Yes, I'm a person, so I'm very happy to do this.
But even now everyone, she has arrived.
(Laughter) I think if you talk about a person ... (Laughter) Ah, yes, it's true.
And what about it?
Attention must be a little realistic and prosecutive: as you're going to scal the Streetland, Spotlight, Spotlight, Spotlight, for Crowing Chong or Crowing Chong.
And then, how do you do it?
Right?
The linear is a bottle, a little replaced by Messen, and the Michelin was.
Animitic: "No, no, no.
Saptary: it's one of the old media, the dancerian units, and it's not, "There are you?
And so, after the last years, this first time I love being a beautiful eternal woman, is a free writer.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass spionerform is used to spy, to control, to express, and there is also another perspective: Internet, fantastic, liberate, a place of total freedom of expression; in reality, these things are equal, in the same way, the Internet is too complex, to be just one thing.
S: Yes.
Aaron says something important: Zaptuas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing, and I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Behind two ladies there are so they can't suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: to take the hell and become part, to the point of not seeing it anymore and make it last and give them space.
Good afternoon everyone, well, in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly, I had a look at theattoo and left.
There were all how many, and he didn't talk about other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
Before, if life had appeared, that had not been planned, had made a reason: In our galaxy there are hundreds of billions oftelle, incredibly older than ours, and maybe we'd already traveled between the stars, but we've never been told in any of these intelligent civilities, and from here.
So, this is possible: I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, before or after, in life, I least do it as always, when I was a child, I kept a stunned sky, and I asked myself if in return to those bright pictures that could be the living beings, which, perhaps, in that moment, were keeping in my direction, outside the Earth, would be an epocentric change for the understanding of the place we were in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there is no center in the universe, a seventh and a half ago, Charles Darwin, has explained to all the other species of the planet, actually we come, of scending all of us from a paragonable unit, maybe even better for the other two.
This is one of the biggest identities of the astrophysics of the last 20 years, 20 years ago we would be able to suspect it, that there were other planets, potentially, that element is made of this atmosphere, and so we could see if there are actually habitable conditions, but, in a future not too far away, we could land in this light that there are pianets around other planets.
I hope that all of us can be testimonies in the Arco of our House Centauri, of a moment of gender, because I truly believe that these other planets, and the answer is, "We're preparing the Snow, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us from an ocean of space, the universe's really big, but, as we'll put this space probe made from the Sun, it's a sound speed, at a sudden speed, at a speed, at a speed, at a speed, a speed of sound speed, to reach a speed, to reach a space which is quite concrete, to reach 100,000 km/hill, an example, that is a very concrete, and here, for me, let me, there is an example, that comes to my brain, that is an example.
And the fact that you have now is time, that is a longer time than what any human civility has existed on our planet, and then, in my opinion, there is one of the things to be present when you try to dare this path, and the other arms are incredibly farther than that, and so, everything is very complicated.
And, I mean, we, in all this, where we are, and so, this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history, the journey of evolution, of life on Earth, for a long time, it replicates, it differentiates with natural selection, the evolution, and only here, to the dust of the duty, between the formation of our planet, and the Earth, and the long afterward, very proficious, very likely, in the lower of all the forms of life, during this planet, there would be many times more complicated, sometimes, to this world, there would be a few times closer to us, to the world's origin, the most complex organs, to our planet, and the world.
But the whole history of humanity is at the end of unghia.
We can download the road as a Lima's field, and this has already happened, because today we know that for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been together with us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe, there's a little the key of all this: if one day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will treat microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrial could be simple batteries, the pregnancy could be dominated by microbes, maybe a kind of advertisement, maybe we are saying something, maybe they are the same intelligent species, that could be very rare, and even their existence might be slightly, incurable, compared to the situation of the universe.
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine if we're seen from the universe, no one would ever realize that we've been.
We are a very young species: just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate through radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived at the entrance of the solar system, but, truly, we had just launched the footprint in this big ocean of the circumstances.
And I think I'm going to be here, I'd really be a fool, if outside there are super galatical intelligences, as you see in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day life, on another planet, and maybe, in a beautiful future, to reach other stelle.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive as long as possible, to be hard, and if we were alone in all this space, then I think that we still have more.
The need to keep access to the end of achieving this wonderful chain of consciousness, for example, in a small planet lost in the window of the world, thanks to it.
AC: The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
AC: No of the sport of those who arrived earlier and classified, but sport has done and generates positive things for others: a sport, likely, can judge, believe in you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I've already traveled the first days, we're terrified in Windok, which is the inner, inside the map, and after six seventy hours of travel, it's enough to travelled Chileans, all the participants who, instead of running, is a number that will come back in more moment, after 1006 - the chose this type of fat.
This is the first cover on the first cover, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 Chileans all of us, we did it during our apartments, but the desert is in general, and the road occurs imprevists, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, it has always the chance to react, and I the first difficulty I had after three kilometers.
Calm down the sun!
(Clapping in rhythm) (Gring) This is not very beautiful.
(Laughter) And of course, that's how you put me... (Laughing) (Laughing) (Laughter) Okay, I've raced everyone, I'm never anyway.
The Dutch of Namibia is the desert I chose, because in this chamber was associated with an important initiative to be happy, and it's possible only to show how my second book is in Maratona, of 42 kilometers that we have, and I don't know if you know, because with the wedding there's no more hot, there's no more lung, but there's no need to be happy, and therefore, when it's a flat of the desert, it's not a science, but it's a shap, but, sadly, because, in a tumm, it's important to give up a slight of the slightest, and also feel that, in the slightest, let's take a tomorrow, let's take the slight, let's of the slightest, let's take the slightest, let's take the slumber of the slightest, let's of the slightest, let's take off, let's take the slumber of the slumber,
We are already in Chile, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia and the sky made: (Sigh) Now, in the last four kilometers, when the age of two are missing, thanks to all of you who have been for their strength.
(Video) Ricardo: Look, there's no more.
I, in the desert, I found, even when I was also invited this morning, when I spoke about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people with me who shared it, other than 26 people, because it's a garage with a lot of contents, 1996, they were never in TSE, and the last person who filed with me in the end, the last few kilometers could make a magic, a magic, an incredible magic.
As you can see, they're all very humiliated, I've also lasted the part, because the things were a bit rigid.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed the spring to give me the opposition to arriving, to finish the ufficious lady, and then return back, and do another Chilean to go back.
(Music) The melted food was over and achieved its goal: on December 20th, 2016, that if you take the figures, they are exactly the numbers that make 16 Chileans, or even 16, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run like this, maybe a bit more I had 40 kids in addition, I wasn't really sports, I smoked.
I had other capsules for the people to think about it, and I probably had 100 meters and had already made it: failure.
Or... Look, besides having a wife that is enough, I had two children, a little bigger - Riccardo, who's already 17 years old - and the other Pietro, who's only six years old - and nothing - Ricking to go to the fourth and Pietro, in primary school, so big - I don't know why Riccardo, I don't have life, there is.
It's a bit like the race, what I've just mentioned before, at the end of the fat, sometimes you should know how to act, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage, and this is the last time you see him riding.
And when did it look?
When it seemed that everything was going well, February 18th, 2016. Lastly, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too tight, OK?
Surely, the Chamber called Ranna, 116 Pitro, you've understood the number.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments.
(Audience) Yes!
You don't have to let go, but you have to!
(Applause) Continuing to continue to dare not to give the strong strength to the heart, because remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed, and Riccardo continues to move forward in life, and give the chance to the other two who arrived: it's never arrived on the 29th July in San Pietro.
Ship!
The message that I'm telling you today is an important message: whatever, we hope to get to the end, but the desert is different, but the editive is always myth, but above all from a physical point of view, even stronger, and so I started to run, the first image, to improve my life, to improve my way, not only in the human desert, the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are, there's always a hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward, because life is a bit like a bottle, right?
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
From 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everyone.
