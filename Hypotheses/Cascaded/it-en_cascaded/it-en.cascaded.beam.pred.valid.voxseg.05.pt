In 2016, I was given a reward.
There's a blinding machine out of there.
The supported sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly.
Behind, your heart beats up in turn.
And the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create data environments.
It's fewer formals, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
He usually enters the classroom.
The first ten minutes, when the students arrive.
Yes, yes, yes.
According to Egypt, my computer to rhythm and play a classic music.
And she thought, "This is the LE.
Well, the first step to create data environments, fewer failing forms.
And try to maintain high expectation of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative.
To transmit the knowledge to the students.
And exactly with this moment I would like to start my lesson.
Splitting you, describing a topic.
But everyone's neck, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
It's in 1942.
The Unite painting.
Stop and stop.
One.
It's a residence in the north of London.
And there was a young boy, thirty.
Alan Turing.
For Laurea has the Cambridge's College.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, Nomeri.
At that time, the guys used a car.
Specially.
It's stigma.
And it was a machine to write.
The digital operator was outdated, but he wanted to get on a paper.
In reality, letters are stamp out other letters, second.
Or a code imposed mechanically under the hand.
Bothedes used this mechanism.
To communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper had in front of you a text without meaning.
I was a writer.
Alan Turing.
It was one of the main figures to "black".
And with his team?
And I built them a machine.
It's the one you can see.
Dietro: in order to decipher.
These are written by ATDESC.
And for this invention you think it's the war.
Well, it's finished with two years old.
Sharing many deprived owner.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science.
The father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine?
And we make them form the concept of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
in 1950.
A public addicted to the marginal area.
"Computing machine learning."
But where does your test suggest?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
Let's say it's another person?
Because if you don't have a computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a surgical machine.
It's a "o" operator.
In a different way, the machine M and the speaker O.
But they give the answers to the person P.
She says that the machine started to overcome Turing's test.
If the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the car and when the answers come from the worker.
And this is a game limiting.
Behind, the vehicle must have special characteristics to overcome the test.
Behind, it must interpret natural language.
But the question, who comes from the person?
We must take the knowledge to formulate the answers.
But you must argument in an automatic way to form these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
And there are different approaches.
To study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
Secondly this approach?
There are two ways to study human thinking, or to capture thoughts when they grow.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
There are two legislative prizes.
It deduced a witness conclusion from which everybody's logic is born.
The second is the subject of the thought?
And it's close to building deductive arts.
And he came back in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
An rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) You must act.
But they must adapt to the answer.
But you must achieve objectives.
And know how to bring them the terminals?
And it must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is linked to intelligent agents.
Riforming Turing's quote can think about a machine.
We can say, we can create a machine.
A artificial agent.
And to think about it.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
In this way, artificial intelligence has the aim of creating entity.
IIA, intelligence.
Your phone is an accent.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
What about this?
Yes, I try to build entity.
Artificial intelligence is supported by man.
It's a ticket.
But do we see today?
These are the machines.
Let's think.
And I said, "I want to go."
I hope you to describe a little the state of art, artificial intelligence.
I would like to use them.
Beh, five classics.
To classify artificial agents, according to their abilities.
We have submarine actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings have the optimal actors.
I'll explain to you with some examples.
Eight managers are the agents that benefit better than all men.
And you can't do me.
For example, agents that solve the Rubik cube, playing a strength four in the best way, playing a sad, do you think that a young man has been rising for some years?
I've given the start of the Rubik cube, and it's resolved in 4.73 seconds.
But a few months ago they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve the indexse.63.
We have sovraumani' agents.
Why do they act better with all people?
For example, the game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the camp is...
Gasparp's faces have been beaten by artificial people.
We have the human rights actors.
But those who exist almost like all people, like the Pocar Texano game.
To answer the question of the kician?
We stop the blanket.
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
And finally, we have subtle people who suffer from all the people.
These are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing today's artificial agents can't do, for example, it's a disguise.
And we're talking about the fruit.
EV: With what is it?
It's the candle.
What are we talking about?
The Mark of Apple bodyrea.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world, in situations of uncertainty.
These are the greatest, the majority of artificial intelligence limitations, in which we think we're far from overcoming the avenue.
And now we see in the future.
Making machines think.
What year do you do?
In America it was introduced to one thing.
From the technological name: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest aspects of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate ascending?
Now imagine a facial line that indicates intelligence with a sponcial floor.
This is a sad moment.
The abandonment ...
I'm preparing in the wallâ€™s law.
Why?
Computational compassion, for example, is measured with the number of transistors inside a chip.
It was two years old in quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
But in 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to Cruzval.
Maybe being able to balance in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
Behind, the machines will pass the test, they will overcome the testing.
And then?
In 2045, theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change.
Well, human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
I was talking about the mental magazine.
Turing didn't just propose her test.
But it also proposes new observations against its own TED talk.
And these observations are no.
These are the bections against artificial intelligence.
What year do you do?
He was a student at the University of Varese.
AC: I followed a course of epistimology, of ethical disorder of computer science, based on E.E.
"Professor Gaetano at Lanzerone Lanzerone."
Unfortunately, it has left us a few years ago.
One of them "I."
The goal we had to do was to propose an obeyed decision.
According to Turing test, artificial intelligence.
And I was the only one to propose?
It's a formulated decision with mathematical communication.
The toney is stupidity.
I want to describe it in simple endings.
But let's suppose that we take the intelligence of all people, to put it in a seed.
I have a sample on the opposite side of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we keep going.
There is an equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a hand.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story.
I'll give you allacomy.
It has the first question.
I can use machines to think.
I'd like to share with you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Good afternoon.
Who of you here today took pictures?
Craziness.
And this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked.
I have completely in hand.
And everyone wins, I call the Rennes, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photographies.
Behind, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who does it.
This photo is highly taken by my phone, which does not make me a photography at all.
I've been living for the last three years.
This is me immersed with my maps.
and to take care of a liquid matter.
Then the MOPAI photography, which is the product photography, which diffuses through the editing phone, its limits, its contradictions, its potentialities, its impact on the market, its manufactured and authorial use.
But what sense can be, trying to understand a contemporary that changes while we're here talking about it, this is just one of the questions I've asked myself during these three years and that I want to share with you this story, but there are many others.
How does photography change the processes through which we communicate?
We can consider mobile photographs a new linguistic way of influencing the issue of the vision as the forms of complication: technological consciousness that exists.
Behind, in the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer, it still makes the difference compared to the simple gesture.
To premise a smartphone pulsant.
And how do photographs change the forms and theestructure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to learn a confrontation.
With photographer, accurators, criticists, theories that deserve the mobile photography had been a way to develop experiences and reflexes.
I took photos of professionals who were already ten years ago.
I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the knowledge of their images shared by cellulating.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
Then, at the desk of the New York Times Magazing, that Tirayan, in Berlin.
Here in the Mobin Stock area, one of the greatest achievements in the new market.
I stopped.
So, in the salt of Parifoto, one of the most prestigious photos in the world, to enter those places where photography ...
It's distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and understood how the photographic cell phone changes these ingranages.
To find answers, I tried to look further, beyond the surface of the big places that are visually visible in contemporary.
selfie, for example.
The selfie is to simply get involved in a world's narcissistic delirium and to get involved as some psychologists have sustained with the discourse of body dismorphism.
And even though it was correlated, as some sociologists have written with the basis of the generation of the millennials.
Or it can't be seen as a safeguard of seventies, as an identitarian settlement, as a residential refrigeration of the AP.
I try to imagine, how it was playfully reviewed by the visa to the feminist artist like "Cate Darwin."
Look at Sholager.
It's the ending axis that has embedded and still segmented our vision of the mobile.
This is my channel, almost, victim, designed by my photographic experiences.
It's simply the result of a world's world epidemic of pleasurable taste, or, as the Belgian sociologist has sustained New York Hanson, can't be led to the sale of the most complex fators of nature.
Social, storage, economical persino.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations, and from this phenomenon I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
Because it's called "I Revolution."
All of us for a story of mobile photographs, because on the edge of images we were married, it seemed useful to try to draw a hand.
Then, if not to find the right, at least to understand where we are.
And how are we?
The history of mobile photographies is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that puts individuals into communication from one angle to another of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective gathering, if you want, that has impressive numbers, every two minutes today we can see more images of how much human beings have scaven in the interaction of this century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
Here's the production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a retirement of professionals, became an activist of our private role in the public dimension.
But in which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better, let's exist because we produce images.
What if the mobile photography is a new language?
Then it's the mother language of liquid man.
In a contemporary, which is still very signed by the question process.
In certainties, as brilliant as seen by the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman.
It's as a tip.
With modernity, euphestructure, work, family, coppy, are increasingly more vacillating, and here, the drawings are intable in a universe in movement, spontaneous in front of the media of the messages that harvest them daily, the fluid of photography cells seems the most natural expression.
A liquid vision that is composed, that is composed.
It is simply based on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone call that the video is left on the professional photographer and what difference goes on.
I photographed it.
Accidents and photographs conscious.
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
taking into account the process of democratization of photography.
I started with the Kodak industry and it arrived until IFO.
On the other hand.
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
New possibilities to approach stories, stories, objectives.
Ancora is part of the opening.
Everyone of us in a dialogue finish line, with a potentially global start, has released the professional photographer of his idol.
It's like producing and distributing of pictures.
I was focused on social functions, economical positions.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network.
It's in the first spider.
But showing that being a powerful tool to guide.
Public opinion is a capilling source of computers and information hardly controlable from the regions: this is a picture of Cairo-Pensit, a show that the Folfang museum of SN has dedicated the role of the photographer's cave.
Well, on the other hand, but.
Think about the possibility of interaction is directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographs and audience, I free it from imposibility to reach the destinations of its message, if not through traditional media channels, such as information, daily, galeries, access and limited resources, and allow them to directly lock themselves in the right of the clouds.
By creating visual content in real time, a particularly interesting example offered the Times magazine, in 2012, with Instagram coverage and directly posted in real time through T-cober's mechanism, its own images, delinating so a new model of New Smaking and visiting journalism, the reality of journalism.
This is the scale model that had been originated after this experiment.
What if it's true that at Disney we photograph ourselves?
Eventually, we rarely look at our images, producing a quantity of photos of a Moon better than the one that we can remember, and truthfully, even in this same period, new ways of observing the history of iconographic memory.
For example, "Site Femili photos," an Instagram accountant, founded by an American photographer, Research, Cournissen, and devoted to conservation of the universal heritage of family photography, including the photographer attacks, each photo gathered through an open exposure to all Instagram users.
It's the frame of a world group where we read in control the evolution of photography and society in the 90s.
Or you are born.
There are new ways to select curatorials, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by two professional and non-violent professionals, and there is a job of scaling on account in the narrative of an issue.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Vengami Lowi.
Now, a life that has used and use smartphone in conflict territories, showing that agility and discretion can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic meteors that, starting with a simple smartphone, exploded new paths for Newsmking, creating a Baystrake platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Fidanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
Bread Mangin, who is the one used for sport photography, exclusive territory, photographic territory, an irreformant looks, and made a huge traffic of intimate and minimal narration over the majority of baseballs.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempted Community to the partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
Peter from Campo, who has been through the Everi Count of Africa.
According to the story of a daily and normal African, there are media stereotypes, of the Western matrix on the crisis and the famous, showed that the furniture of the photos, lungs of limiting themselves simply to put in discussion the photovoltaic stereotypes.
It's like the Luis that reinterpreted the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, storying in the IV TV series that I'm one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history with the most new vision tool.
It's, or like the Lord Lind has shown his sad manifesters in the sink, who is, during the protests of Midan, with an old lady.
And nowadays, it has registered with its own cellulating the moment when theotor of the bronze bursts.
And the image is born, translating a photographic experience in the pocket, tranalogical and digital, far away.
It's contemporary stretto.
Well, what do these photographs know, that we all don't know how to do?
Going back to the outskirts of action or looking for high levels of personal vision of the evolution.
Where do we register?
Creating images that are never straight at the reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto.
Contaminate creatively the codes of storytelling.
Project in a media erotic, thinking, and creating its own content to be broadcast in diverse platforms and reach different publicities.
Fare net.
By using connections in an innovative way.
To think about the authorsal exercise for their own perspective on the world and the quality of deep inside, because whatever the tool that makes pregnant.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a coherent manner.
Think about it.
Sleeping.
And from the background path, the eyes hide.
That's all I believe.
It's still a difference between photography, isn't it?
Take a look.
A reward of real life.
Be it.
The chemical reproduction, its self-reference and sharing, and a photograph that, in reality, can also be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you very much.
And do you feel it?
Let's feel it.
What we believe is to be silence.
And in reality?
There are 50 electric wheelchairs.
50/30, I entered highly.
It's in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
The first one.
It doesn't exist.
So also in this room, those sectors, these seats.
And give it a frequency of 50 euros.
You can imagine, right?
I went home after a job magazine.
Very stressed?
I banged with your partner, and then I got to bed on the block of your bed.
And I thought I'm on my own.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50 H.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
It's a negative act.
This silence doesn't exist.
But of course.
Theultive.
But we are never alone.
I'm always that beautiful thing correct.
This frequency of 50 H.C.
That's great.
Paranoid.
If we keep it.
Like a drawing.
The frequency of 50/30, is nothing else.
One round is no.
A beautiful richer pet.
With which you can make music, and then I was controlled.
Don't do it like that.
Cool.
I'm a composer of sound columns, an art.
But my life was complicated, I decided to make music exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
They started when I was more.
I don't know.
Many of you think.
Thank you very much.
But no.
The revelation of my life.
Is it solitude?
During those days, in the burden of that row, of that house, I started to make music with everything around you.
Didi?
Every barefoot complements weren't anymore.
It's a complementary classic of the drip.
Love, immobile.
Thank you very much.
And it's really my musical tool.
Every time.
I use bicycles.
I'll say, at some point.
I tried to become...
It's a normal person, I mean.
So I started studying.
Little.
I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to stop the clarity.
The problem is that I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautifully ambiguous song, soiling the first genuine years of studio.
When I also have clarinity?
Just like this, to not go.
The illusions of my classmates.
"Yeah."
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to disagree it with the problems of life.
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumor, a failure.
Something that made us worse.
It's a certainty that the sound has made us grow in much more.
I have a smile.
So here's my mission.
Even when I'm a kid, it's like transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
Let's talk soon.
I don't say it.
I'm going to make a great turn of dollar, Gino Paoli.
And all this would be conclusions, but no, my life was complicated in this way.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
What is the study?
Well, this is one of the hardest ways to understand, but also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion.
Our inner ears, the colony of bones, our team, reach the massive functional.
But around the fifth week and the pregnancy.
Fifteen week of gestation, that means that we start listening.
Before talking, we start to listen even before watching.
And this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
I hope that speternity in life, once born, must be ready to the sound texture, mustn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So it doesn't matter if mom, during pregnancy, has listened.
British drugs can't be stupid if the child is once born.
- Yes.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
- Yes.
Put your hands.
Then I prepare you, and it's an expression I make you personally, be careful for the musical choice.
Where else?
What's going on?
Nothing.
In other words, that's it.
Everything we are surrounded by, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
What in our lives is completely upset.
But you can't see, you can't touch.
To me, the colony is now in every magazine, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who screams us, because mom screams us, and yet, always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Well ...
Of course, the aim is much easier.
I don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
In a small town, what else, there is a smaller one of the Militarian man?
in a small town in San Pietro.
You're in your house, maybe?
This thing, as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I saw many people, he tells me.
I imagined it louder.
And well, of course, even because the basis would be really impossible.
So?
Let's come from this budget.
What about the visitor?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound.
Loud?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try!
Imagine our life, I would like to enhance your ability to observe.
But we are ...
In vacation.
It looks like the sea, not in case.
And I started to continue.
To take pictures of the feet, to the wisdom, then to the highway, and later it's photo from the bottom, they don't do it, but we also make those, then there's the aperfacetable gold, so we use a drone to take a photo of the drink, and, on the other side, then it's 360, and it's here, more than 100.
There's the sweet, no, not to eat the sweet, because I have to take a lot of photos: "I have a food blog, that talks about food, zero Chile, vast Chile, Chileans, Chileans aren't, I've lost the tale, but it's multicansensorial, multimultural and multimultural food that had a photo sky.
But nobody loses the damage.
I photographed it.
Why do we keep it?
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
And we never stop.
To listen.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others.
Should we do it?
"Ah...?"
Listen.
Close and listen to you.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, hooing it.
your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you.
And the dream of my life.
The dream of my life, born.
What about harassment?
One of me.
For the first time, the architect of myself.
But it was 2013, I wanted to flee far from space, a series of failures, problems, and many others.
Then they turned into harmony, but I try to find a far away place from school.
So, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
There was no window.
Was it still there?
It was one of the farther cities, culturally.
This is really far from me: Shanghai.
That's it...
And participating in a competition, an artistic residence and the most beautiful years of my life was simply listening to me for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear.
I had an idea, but I was the only growth and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of all over the world, of all the cities of the world, creating for each one of us a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of City."
And everything really is part of the waste of the city.
Cities are a great musical tool to access this musical tool.
We waited to enter the heart of the city.
And I'd like to bring you back!
In this moment Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a spiritual column.
So?
In this moment?
I want to swallow you.
Shangah.
Divive!
Live!
OK, okay?
Invisible!
(Whistle laughing)
- No.
I'm going to live.
Focus on the visitor.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say.
All of us exposed to the visitor.
I'm sure you've been shooting in any way.
And you are more bound once.
The smoke, the cave in the tomb.
What do I say?
But Brooklyn bridge can resonate.
Brooklyn bridge is an exceptional one that suffers completely in its leg.
And where do you want to dream?
There's an interview that truly collapsed me.
In Colum, it's an important thing.
Thank you very much.
[A.DE.]
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
But it's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes, every day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
Well, in this picture...
The Understanding Regulation is...
Both the producer?
Without sleeping, going to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite city now.
Put up the applause and I've seen it.
[A.DE.]
This has registered the first sounds.
And the first sounds gave me data of these children that in this tube.
But of iron, a portable gate, they gave me this help camp.
And I can make you feel, first of the Greek audio camp, and then that.
And BBA.
"Wow, that's great,
And I like a puzzle.
Who's it?
I've never been normal.
"Oh, I'm an actor!"
Belgium, beautiful, and it has left a fraction.
What becomes?
Right Genova is "Mor Zenzy."
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a fight, that's a serious thing.
Every time.
And she writes them.
Here you can see a lot in the Ferrari village.
And it's not only a writer: for me it's a great musical tool, and it has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last speak, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
You have a lot.
It's filled with the pork.
We are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I immersed it for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because by putting it into the loop it has become the LAP.
A transitors of the southern column.
And it's true.
Hello, now.
Would I make you feel Genova?
But it took me to this point.
This is Geneva like his.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
It's almost the sound of our passions, in my and in your lives.
And as people will tell you that you're rumorous, you're out of time, you really want to hear it, it's always worth listening to you, and I'll thank you for listening.
How does Guybek say in Italian?
AC: The word that is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea of the idea: in general, the idea of the Revolution linked to the Monetary Ristitution.
It's to the benefit.
AC: Many times, instead, the restitution is connected to restiting what you did, what you learned.
And to pass from the part of those who say: it doesn't work.
Well, then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post had 18 minutes shared some aspect of this story.
From the end of the 90s, precisely, this is my son's paper.
It has a network near Segrate.
And in the same year, my mother Monico organized the money recipe to pay the school.
From the asylum.
CR: It was an activity.
Very heavy, and with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the normal state."
But most of them faced these extraordinary reports.
To help astronomy, to help the community.
It's taken a billion and 200,000 to read, because you don't remember, it's 600 euro then.
And it was one of the strengths of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we went to the United States, this time...
It's similar: the same school at a school in the neighborhood, this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
Which means the gameback of restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is mandatory for the whole of society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Nothing else.
It said this the thing of restitution: I was lucky, I became a member of the school, and I went to the university.
It helped the museum, along with theaters, there are all the communities that can potentially remain a voluntary restitution, not that in fact there is no such thing, but here it's a phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are alsochanisms, there is also physical instability, there are processes.
The foundation is not based on this.
I've been working for ten years.
Maybe you've met him, this is the game of...
It's from the top of the famous Obamaker.
The sound that says: "Dad, Miss Done is now."
We are already expecting a lot.
But, collectively, they ask, "System is one of the moment."
A famous baking lotter Obama was an incredible technological debt.
The technological advantages haveeso 100 million dollar salts, so not worried about these things are not only happening in Italy.
They build a seed that doesn't work so many millions of contents, and this is the standard response they receive.
But, briefly, the criteria doesn't end for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticating, and it's enough to be done.
It's easy and normal to start by trying to do and help that is extraordinary.
For us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
But it's the technology awards that have been sent by Google and other companies, there are wounds.
And as I agree with the white house, they've got the richness, the broken and ticket, they've put on the seat, stay, you can be in just a few weeks, in a decim of the cost.
And probably many of us would have criticized, but Google probably has its own interest in this.
A: Yes.
And the extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG discovery without very interesting time, and that's what ...
I want to explain to you about what it was spinning, I hope for people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives, experiences.
In this case?
But they keep the ability to manage greats, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible.
And make them again reproduce and scarce.
It's creating a replicable system that is the "YORS Digital Serrice," from this time, it has been born.
A replicable system, what we expect to do as well.
But I want to suffer with the word "del them."
Because we also impose the models, which have been the ows of our lives that have inspired us and have taught us.
Those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never bother, to continue to insist.
This is energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
But the idea of returning, helping, is also because they're Italian.
A: Yes.
I really wanted to do it.
CR: Do you want to see the world?
Doing or not do that?
AC: There's no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do, let's do it, there's no point only to criticize.
Twenty years later, we're five to meet MaterÃªncia San Francisco, and he came in my business, in Silicon Valley, which is unthinkable to the need of transformation in general.
Also, those things have increased us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of the public recording.
She asks me, "Why don't you think about helping employment for a couple of years, I think, I reflected the packaging with my wife, Monica, and I talked to my gay boss, to make it brief, I decided to apply a methodology of choice, and I couldn't do it, or I try to not even find it?"
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years.
A compliment.
B.G: Oh, manzone.
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so, in this moment, we're focusing on this part, but on a positive side, there's a state.
But I was mentally convinced about chooticism and bureaucracy, people asked me, "But what about the disaster of this disguise, and I did not expect?"
Butoscienticism isn't often about cinism that has reminded you of a certain mentality.
But you never see her, of course, you do it because you have teachers, I felt many of this kind.
In reality, our country lack a lot of sense of common good.
It's about doing things because you think of helping, improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner.
For the older people, you recognize it, like me, the Migrey commission.
I say this because my book, my films, and then, immediately, from the beginning, of extraordinary commissions, is simply because it's their rule that led me to be able to assume people on the foots of public administration.
And of course, the only thing I asked you is.
Since the systems from the inside aren't transformed, we want to try to transform them with people from outside, where the fact that we don't know the public administration.
It's an asset, not a reliability, it's an advantage and not an advantage.
So, of course, we created a small team, I wanted to create a small team, I've read 25 people, a world everywhere.
FdB: Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations around 80 percent, 20% are expected to perform judges, legal ones.
They are communication governors.
As you can see the post I had done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't write what we think will happen.
But in this way we want to bring such feelings: charities who live in Italy, or who want to become us.
Surther times there is a compassion, and probably much better than what you see, how you're convinced.
So I got into the idea, but how can I invite someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photographer in Bella's mind that in the 1947 she caught all the United States, who has given her phone children, in all the United States, in this sport, mass media.
I need investments and infrastructure.
We created the vision.
It's the country operating system, a series of fundamental components, we can build simpler servings, efficient for citizens, public management and companies, through innovative digital products.
Vision?
Very good, poisoning is crime and blood.
And I've continued in my place: field of businesswater, older than the American future, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also find many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it is an easy prediction.
We must learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many will say: don't understand how public administration works.
But they've already tried many, they failed in Italy, it doesn't work that way.
And continue?
Let's take a lot of criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be ugly and prejudice.
Well, the criteria of the first type will be rid of people who really want to offer spontaneity to their contribution and we have many treatments.
The second guy, the colors who want to defend the status quo, is that they always use the animal.
Or more simply, they are considered the impossible.
And this is a big problem.
To recognize things that don't work.
You remember the image of the first time, men and women in the carpet of Time magazine.
Here's it.
So, despite having tried to memorize as much as possible for us to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions.
Of that, at least one hundred times decisively qualified, we used digital towers for collochi, an app called Jazz, we put it in Beth in the edge of the Govern.
It did a math test, a mathematical test, a technological part.
The team had completed the critical mass nearby, so there are seven geniuses, now we are a little more turned into, and it has immediately started to operate.
In fact, we are dealing with idraulics.
These are the tubes of public recording, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever that should be interconnected is to silos in not to connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to sponsor their own data, their own suffering, their own applications.
So it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it.
And in years to implement it, of connectivity, of interroperability.
Open the shareholder of the recording public.
There are many centuries of software, of course, and doing so many activities in the management project.
CR: So so many Israelic activities?
We can't.
The colors.
To make the tasks of the sink, in time, you have to make them better, to interface the tents, and become more simple.
Many of these things are done in parallel, but without your thesis you can't do the right.
But after a few months in the period of 2017 we wrote, in these months, the piano tends to the public recording public, we did together with the help, other people who helped us, what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in my presentation?
In order to explain there is one thing, there is.
Due.
Then it's written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole has stigmatized the decrease of the present, which is minister, digital transformation is a state priority, the trendial piano.
And it requires a team game to simplify public recording, the life of citizens, particularly the piano.
QD: It's been newspaper once in the year, because the kids couldn't have been, there are especially technology.
And you appreciate it from recording.
But there is this, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy in public management.
It's revealing the technological rules and the rules of potentially releases three warning campaigns and connecting to other norms in other regulations, and at some point there are the technological rules that are fairly naked in the understanding.
But unfortunately, we can't abolish these things, but we can do things in parallel other things, so the ugly piano.
It has brought all your technological skills to understand it.
It's placed in Forum, where we can talk to the administrators, give us feedback, documentation on the roles of Ox, so that the administrators themselves, the technology to public recording, software and labs can't.
To improve it.
Before, we dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano to competitive platforms, digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in spontaneously all the activities of public recording, and the more they will be.
Digital payment is one: digital payment is one: electronic card, electronic card, anattability.
Digital identity is a retirement platform.
And the best project that we've followed now is called national and resident anagraphy, well!
Let's do that.
Banalizing technologically, all the data of citizens that at this time are about 8,000 different silos, which are the 8,000 Italian communities.
He's a great database.
Yes, they synchronize.
But where the data is talked to each other, they are all synchronized and they talk to the rest of the administration apps, when I come across a community to the other.
I must initially say what I'm managing now, then I must become a citizen, go to the association, motorization to all those posts, and I must say all those things I've already wanted to know.
We're solving the technological solution, and we're already doing so much about the processes.
But two weeks ago we made an Akaton.
It would be.
Two 800 software developers have worked on that ability to apply, they have been used in 96 interventions.
Bag-fixing, therefore, putting up on software problems, improving documentary and even new projects.
It was created in 25 Italian cities.
A San Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from a technological point of view, from space.
But all of this?
It confirms that we're talking about sustainability and replicity and scalability.
But it's in the beautiful space for sponsors of art, as well as T, where they are wives.
Tutta documentation, in all the coders, but always more, applications.
It's Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
And I was also working.
Out of other projects that can't be limited to do as anaulic, I also enter the ball.
But it's good for kids to be composed, to disappoint me, this might be, for example, and it's one of those things which is shortly broken.
When we'll launch Alsa version, alfa, it's called digital citizens, it has the phone.
The smartphone has the digital identity, has data the card of electronic identity, Nepsi.
Is it already functional?
And all this is the aim of making it easier, familiar with the interaction of citizens is the management public.
It's easy with interroception.
And we're dreaming a little, because work is what we truly do so much, but it has to be our vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
In computer for 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited for many people to talk about what they think can happen.
I was asked to talk about basic simplification of the life of the citizens every day.
I put the chance to write an article I want to cite to you.
Some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
A country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, to clichÃ© building it.
A country with high technological competitions is also inside the State and public companies.
A country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine to a country where to work for public administration is an wealth: where the best humans do better to work in public research centers, that are seen and owners of eccellence and innovation.
What do they bring development to the country?
Now I'm a dream.
And that the components to do all this technological process policies are really many and maybe many of them.
But if it's not a dream that difficult to punish hardly, they can do things.
Let's conclude.
This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
It's been brought in some part in this theater, between the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and you couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like the slums, like the 25 kids of digital transformation, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Here's one thing.
Are you ready for information about us?
It's our dream.
Would I have the chance to make a wish?
One only to change a aspect of your life that won't come.
What changes?
What would you change?
Raise your hand if you'd change the job, your boss and your employees.
You're scared, they're keeping you, that's it, huh!
(Laughter) Because here, I know there is.
And then raise your hand those who would change something about your body, maybe lose some thread.
Well, maybe you'll save them, muscles.
AC: Oh, well, here's a bit more, there's more freedom.
Then raise your hand if you'd change the corriente, better if you want.
That was sure everyone would have come to me.
And maybe you are one of those who will change?
Throughout my life, I asked myself this question.
But let's not understand if I'm going to change.
And the answer was different, because elementary schools would have a more united family.
But my parents don't separate.
To my fears, I would have become more beautiful.
I'd like to love more to the kids.
Liceo would have felt the most complex professors, it seemed to me all eyebrows and I was reflected in music, here the great voices to be in the test room.
Even if the university would have wanted to work, but I had found the difficulty of accessing the job market.
So, the first part of my life, I went through fighting and fighting to try to understand how to change things that didn't belong to me, what others thought of me in the great economical sides, in the interpersonal relationships.
It has some characteristics I have acquired the end of birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I broaden my research into other people.
And I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
And these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit.
If most of the situations were the only three signs to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve something good, but they would end up maintaining their problems in life.
Nowadays, the strategy is more broadcast.
Well?
FdB: The mind.
And we're lamenting a little bit of it.
Once there's crisis, there's no job, there's traffic, frÃ­o, that I'd have done differently.
We feel sorry because there is no justice.
I meet many people who go to the table.
And the problem is that if you design mental space, this paralyzes you.
The skeptical guy and shakes the today's purchasing.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, who wasn't doing anything else to get bothered, from when I started talking, to when I stopped coming home.
She started lamenting my triumphy.
She left her, and then the much girl with whom she shared her.
So the fact that he didn't have a job, the ultimate government national ship that didn't help him, felt worthwhile, abilities, and here, the mind had completely colonized it all its daily lives.
And it's hard to get along.
For all of us, it's a bit like this temptation, because with a small effort you can obtain a great result.
To remove the rule of the victim.
What is listened, comforted?
Wow, that's it.
But beware.
And can you wake up at night or at day, on your own or with your friends?
The highest voice or your mind?
And you can remember one thing already happened, or one thing that maybe one day could happen.
You can lie to your tea, or how much more often it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
Because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that as much as you're forced to disappoint you hardly have something around you.
It will change, older, you won't get any other way to pay more attention to what is fast.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as adults, is that of lamenting.
Suppose that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair.
Let's start.
Another very tiring strategy.
When things are stretching, it's that of imporciation, it implies our need.
At the base of this mentality there is an increasing cultural factor based on the way we learned that if something doesn't work is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being what surrounds us.
You don't like ducks.
But from those who are skeptical noises?
You felt a bit dirty, but why would you never be suffering?
We took two pillars and resolved it.
Your wife breaks you, divorce!
In the fresh lights we can see how many risks are at handle.
"Here, don't listen to you, let me."
It's too big that we couldn't lead it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand.
So, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, so that the world around you can encourage the perfection with your belongings.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, is.
Behind the coppy relationships.
Let's remember one, a coppy.
During the schools I had no choice but to listen to what, according to one, the other had to change to solve it.
Safness of their future.
He is.
Well, it's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in a grade.
It's a classic later.
And the law, right?
But you know you who will never see me, if not for that.
And he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who don't listen to me, either otherwise.
To get in touch.
So, through the infinitely, a iron-lorant arm.
It always starts with the same stretch word.
Because we must show the whole equity of the other, we must make them see.
All the problems that should be supposed to do is to restore our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing we say it often in good feet, believing deeply.
But we are hardly able to change something, old.
And instead of putting up the nights at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them, to apply them.
Or if the strategy of privilege, when things don't go as you are, it's that of giving up your necessity and waiting for others to change as a consequence.
And we thought about a couple of times, because you'll have a life ...
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
It's a third strategy.
And when things are in a way that doesn't like us, eh?
Far signs that there are no, like a tool, to take the forehead, put it underwater.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the aim of facing the conflict emerging, then we should show our needs.
So what do we do, do we suffer them for the common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live at the mercy.
That's necessary.
I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, whose end of the first childhood had learned to district with great degree between the kids of mum and dads.
I hope I hope that the time you were openly locked in the confronts of each person would have lost the love of the water.
In this limited situation.
Something important happened.
For example, I learned.
To listen.
To accept, to rag their motivations, even distant from one another, but on the other, I never learned to say no.
But I didn't learn the things that didn't work with them.
I started to say no to the relationships that were looking for it, there was any social condition, and the old one was one of the ones that had all the media time, but in this way where they were going to finish their needs, their desires, and their ambitions were always under the fear of facing conflict and the need to count on how many.
Because if the strategy of privilege, when things are not as wisdom.
It's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling you all how many, I'll finish to find out.
I want to get sorry.
It involves your needs or suffer them.
But there are three limiting strategies: I can say this with a cause-function, because I myself, a long time, in my life, abused.
I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary school for which I collaborated, sent me to call.
And my dissip.
Okay, here, for her, there's no more time."
If you like to continue collapse with us, you must accept a disorder.
And he showed me a far away, expected place, stopped from the most.
But, besides, I had to go there to do a job that didn't even have a great deal with all that I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other.
And even more, because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
And there you see that...
And to get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my hair, at that moment.
Do you know the secret to change others?
Changing yourself.
What if I changed?
Also, the others would have to follow, change, change.
If I turned into a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, the primary school would not send me anyway.
It's also the dwell.
What wouldn't harm me more than you.
In a few years, maybe I would have gone away before I even imitated it.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the harp of others, but I had to ask my deep reflection.
Responsability.
Why are things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is to choose.
Seeing the places as a cause of things that don't come as I wanted.
Keep in mind as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is ours.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
Now I'll be there alone, and guilty, to confront something much bigger, I want to say, it's the crisis's side, what do you want to do?
But if instead of you, you think of being perfect, that maybe there's a marginal of change, that then improved, then you open your doors in front of you, because it spreads your responsibility, the speaker, you can always decide to learn a new language, read books, go to chores to acquire new skills, or consolidate those you already have, you can work on being a journal.
Because life is from those who are.
Who doesn't do it?
He suffered it.
If it's inside the back.
Well, things don't go well, you think it's the other way to take the first step.
And it's showing them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it.
And if you are part of you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently to make your best magazine?
And then things change, but they don't change anyway, but they change because you know you're changing.
First, I was looking for his obsession.
But now you see the search of your needs.
And then I tried to operate.
to satisfy them.
It's in this way that a mental space inside which we can take care of each other, instead of making the comet.
I don't know one of those people.
Still with everyone, which must always say, yes, one of those people I call, forgive me to finish, gravitational prostitution.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do, if you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions put in the field to preserve them.
Then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a guitar standard.
Before, starting to work on myself, considering myself the cause of the things that didn't work like I wanted, instead of their simple effect.
I also started to warn that I was a better person.
But when I was writing to university, I had a dream.
The dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes even raped, to bring great value inside their lives.
But, my friends, I met.
I do it with a couple of life.
What about the problem?
Stereots, prejudices, psychologists are the doctor of the mates, psychologists are the doctor of the debts, but they had to talk to a friend, but they go to the barbecue, but what should I do?
That's not the case.
I would have had to get lamented or not to explain how many good psychology would I have to try to change their mental priorities, should I abandon my dream?
And he said, "No, I had to.
We could learn to speak a language, which was not happening, as closer to the agget, I had to learn the dynamics.
In virtual cakes, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs instead of having mine.
It's the turn of...
Little time.
Keep this saying?
I got the results for me.
They are not inimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of trashment, I didn't sleep for three days and three days.
Then, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
But I would have accepted suffering.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
And they got to the case, I killed the computer and I recorded a video that I cartooned on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the crack, I'm talking about collecting ants, because maybe they think...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm from 79 published psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best editors, in Italy, my house, and what surrounded me more than anything.
It was recognized that the bonds at first came to leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something thought, and in Lumbia, they were elected to the presidential and anonymous.
I had dreams.
But don't become real why?
Fortunately, or why did you have been treated?
But is the theory that should have that?
It's the one that's holding and that keeps forward.
Those who don't know how to build and need to fight.
Because the topic should do it.
And you should also put your identity into discussions, your partners' points, your certainties, your many habits of always.
[A.DE.]
If there's something I've learned from all this journey that helps me.
It's that the most important transition.
Maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
But it must benefit from our internal circle.
For many reasons, I've asked you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life, that doesn't come to you.
What would I change?
And we talked about work.
It's the right physical fact of the right story.
Well, in my childhood, I'd like to share with you ...
With a gift, at least prove us.
This is a small question that was very useful to me personally.
And that's based on the logic that, in order to generate big changes, you have to focus on so many small actions.
What's the smallest thing?
It's easier.
What you'll do until now, at the end of the store, to tell you in case after this beautiful newspaper.
And what will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the direct?
AD: auspicious care.
You may think: what's the smallest, the simplest thing?
What can you do?
And to put your life into the directing, here to the environment.
What happens?
Wow, you like a frugon or a mango tree.
The ugly to asso, I left the pullman.
Where do I put the packs?
Let's move!
Yet, that's not the proof.
Ah, happy, her hair every day.
Oh, she suffers and it's.
What is the moment to change?
(Video) Offiti is when I arrived to my mother.
Do you know something?
TED...
TED: It gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And I put it aside.
In this time I want to take it by myself.
But I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
with diverse and different abilities.
percussions are so fast.
And so immediate.
They take off the distances and join the battles.
We are partners.
We are part of the sets.
Boys kids, I see them, I see, mature, fear.
But at all, I saw them growing.
Our provides were marriage.
Tuesday was the day of the project.
And where was this inside?
Well, I'm in the school of Andreolia.
They were peeled the first bidonies.
It was together, the first warned together.
And then we decided to become a sea in the wind.
From there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical sights and we saw the first ones, the first weddings in the butterflies.
And the first satisfaction, the first encounters?
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately ...
One night, 20th of July 2012 the beloved world crossed.
In the real sense of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of thousands.
All the roofs were called this.
As I said, the cases were ...
Not even today B.
Many of you think: our room provides, our place where ...
And where all marriages were found was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
B.G: Me, Sara, Marco, fede, Matteo.
We focused on them.
All of us.
I: Novettete a doppoli.
It's the erlobo.
We've done it.
Luckily, we found them.
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the thirst of manuals, of just a thousand.
Within that tender?
There were magnificent things.
We've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because reading a book makes them stronger than the end.
And it kept us in the eyes.
One with the Earth shaking?
But to look for a smile.
And a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
These are the tubes that have become?
From building and combined with ping pong roots.
The crying leaves with mark markets,
We were constantly.
Well, in the continuous job, there was always an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already inside is born our first spettacol, we decided to put a true spettacol.
However, the group components were increasing, the friends were speaking.
But from 20 years of now, we turned into 25-30-40.
Five years old?
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men, and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
It's like a glass blank.
Afterwards, afterwards.
But did we do it?
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
But it is also a moment of our Earth.
to breathe for a moment.
Last year after we made cracks, this marine show.
It's immediately after.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second.
On this Moon, it's looking at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought it's a stone.
But it could change our lives.
But...
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a fauna.
150 impacts in return to the state.
The stage of the first master?
GV: The concerts on the TV program at a friend's house.
This is the kindergarten stage.
And we've done so much.
To me and also to me.
They download the tabs, because that's my thing.
It's exactly the circumstances of life.
It's the fatal, the sound, but also...
One of the freshness.
The problem is there are so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes the other?
Now I have to go back to the easy sounds: do you expect me?
Why is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, no!
Due.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and I'm really born as a approach, until I realized what happened?
In the last 250 years.
That's it.
250 years that have radically changed our history and that we live now.
We talk about social innovation.
And my question is, what is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
This is the digital fusion, we all carry.
Also, near us, I believe almost everyone.
In fact, it adds a evolution that was extraordinary precisely in the past 25 years, it's the phone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
It's a computer, evolving, and the computer belongs at the same time.
And to the internet revolution is connected and once again this is an invention of the Internet revolution, of the internal aspects of our history, however.
And these three factors together, joining mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, in some way, strictly battled arbitrely during the 2000s, that we are living today.
Let's understand, then, what happened in these 250 years, which ones flood?
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet and the Internet, the Industrial Revolution, when we call it to remember, we probably remember it as an iron.
What was my studies?
This one in the school book, in fact, wasn't just an iron.
And we, in the Industrial Revolution, we've managed enormously debate.
It's an ordinary boss, for example, because we have the steam motorcycle.
And the winning motor is not only a winning motor, but it's, for example, the tool that has favored, and it resembles much faster, the energy estation, and the rising possible to a significantly lower cost.
And then the vapore mask entered the cordificialities, entered the belts, and started changing the modalities, but not taking pictures.
And we don't only need the motorcycle.
The winner, should we A?
The scoppy motorcycle.
The motorcycle, because it's also a Toscanican invention, it's an Italian invention.
The motorcycle is tidy.
And we need, for example, the automobility industry.
Actually, it was the usual industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motor that could not go from far away when I was able to understand.
which was an internal combustion motorcycle when I wasn't able to understand how to wake up that belt, to turn it into the verb, and welcomed with the seed that has developed.
But the automobility industry is all that's been taught.
But not just that.
At the Industrial Revolution, we still have the debates, for example, for the phone, the phone isn't only with the tool that permits us.
To keep reviewing our letters and that has rapidly modified the migration of these letters from one part to another of the world as much as I knew.
But it's also what has allowed us and has taught us.
to deposit the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because after the phone, we could try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
But let's interrupt everything.
Next.
I went on, carrying caves under the sea.
The first cavity, to dare a storic dimension, was taken from artists between Mexico and articulated abbia.
But not only two populations coming from agreement, but the first cave stayed there.
And we are around 1852.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, transports our voice.
And in 187900 failed to Rome.
It's only 1870 kg.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electric power plant.
Keep going in Europe.
It was built and traveled by Santa Radigonda, where it was.
It's the girl who feels Mility, today serves a scent.
Recently, in 1873 the first electric power plant was built.
In that year, on December 30th, the scat was illuminated.
It's part of our history, it's swimming from others.
But let's move forward, let's try to get a bit longer rooms, and we arrive at 1950.
The adventure has already grown, and it's getting to know a certain act, and it has been a seventh.
It's still a long time, but it's already experienced important revolutions and even important emotions after cultural disturbances.
But it starts to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the first history: they are the computer, they are the calculators.
The school designer who, in the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stance like this, and had functions of marriage.
They simply looked faster with the calculation.
But they have been advancing and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent.
And they became the contributors of intelligence.
They started to be artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the internet revolution happened little by little.
There were times of research, and above all, there were scope of tweet and defense.
They brought us to develop landmares, but they didn't know how to take off all the land.
But endless, because they weren't known.
At some point, he decided to open these letters.
These rots called arpa, the Internet.
They became and began to be the World Web, which we know.
It's a broadcast, horizontal, non-archical, extremely captured system, capable of bringing information, collecting information and generating information.
To give you an idea, in 1981 only 300 computers connected to the Internet.
In 1995, there were 25 million.
[A.DE.]
Today, it's in the minds of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that connect to the network.
But to add data to this data, to collect data, or to work on data.
When does the strength work?
It was with a definition.
It was introduced by the industrial revolution.
It started to embrace artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
A: Yes!
The Internet.
We had the ocean that if we little began to live the ocean that we lived now, that we are living now.
It's what's called "Indassia the Internet," and this, second, a phenomenon of "creater disruption," of creative destruction.
And that, fundamentally, is an industrial process that tells us.
Because what's new progressively distruggles what's old, because it needs to make space.
And we will better see how, but this is the story of the great numbers, of great inventions.
But there's a story that is a bit more complex, that belongs to us a little more, in which it generates a reflection.
I've tried to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, from the scale, I still haven't done the Italians yet.
Mister minister got financial purchases.
But it establishes that 27th grade month is correct, the payment is public dependencies.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
In this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing inghet minds, I'm introducing something extraordinary.
But first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce good servings, that were necessary for their support.
But with the security of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky.
From the stages, the less risky ofallel, started somehow away from the Earth.
And so on.
It has transformed the economic power of the power of production of goods and goods in the power of producing of one.
Well, the denaro.
I'll leave a second aspect.
What is the sign?
For us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has sufficiently read us.
But, in effect, was the mammal?
It's that it's not only that object that free us from the urge to go and sphere every day, but it's also that industrial system that allows us to keep it.
In a massive way, a structured way, healthyly, in the soil quantity of food.
So, a D?
There is still the chance, once again.
To concentrate on something that is not.
Immediately, the emergence of everyday life.
And this is the man that begins.
To live to the end of the 90s, these are us.
And in the breath, what did we say?
They arrived the computer and arrived the internet, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, meaning, an element.
What we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, were not as fast as we are today.
Today we do things very fast, we move at speed.
The speed of the rings, the speed of movement, the speed of our movement, and the speed of our thoughts, which is not in detail of the thought.
But we are much more than him.
And until something happened.
Basically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the messages from one section to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
1900, 1900 and 2000.
When can we say that the 20th century has finished?
I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that significantly indicates the passing of one or another, from one seventh to another, 2001 and 2001.
And he gave "ON", because.
First of all.
Because the American economy started to slow down, the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, started to change.
Those unbalanced, that seemed lonely, we were cut, were very fragile.
But we move forward until something happened, normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world, would never meet.
It's not only America, it must slow down.
I almost closed.
There was also nothing.
And there were Europeans who were to fail.
And the police was already the dream of failure.
But they don't talk about it, but still there.
It changed something.
And... did you change anything, changed the economical paradigm?
We couldn't.
But we weren't expecting the biggest economic crisis.
That, effectively, when it was verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think.
But how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would happen.
We were grabbed and didn't know it.
And to tend, look at these images.
And this print?
Well, there are potential multinationals in most of them, but above all, all the companies that are given after 2011.
What did these companies do, aren't they innovated?
And inventing something, they haven't been able to build something that was before, bro, they started doing what we've always done, buy, sell, travel, learn.
It learns.
The diverse way.
The most efficient way.
And the second one, the school was so often denied.
We tried to look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors: connectivity.
We have ten percentage points under the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a speed connections for 50%.
It's so little.
Anything already, according to human abilities of human resources, the ability to heal, to a distant being between advanced and competences based on what allows us to flow.
In informational systems, digital systems, those advances that allow us to develop.
It's a third future that we should look and use the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, he commits.
I'm an industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
This is the public recording system: we immediately go back to the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the enemies of the important ones.
And most importantly, a good news for everyone: all five elements are growing, all five elements are in a growth, in a speed of completely growth up until two years ago.
We're lineing the European countries, and this doesn't mean anything.
But on the other hand, connectivity, we said it, 11 points out.
But objectively, you just need to watch the newspapers and see who?
We are growing fast, there are new barriers, between new operators and new competitions, and we are building up a new roof.
And competitive, very important, the use of intuition, frankly, we are seconds really by little.
Actually, a very profound change has been brought to the European standards.
But there are two factors that we must look at with great attention, that will be hidden for our country's future.
And they are the abilities and the inclusion of digital data in brutal factors.
In this way we have to pay a lot of attention.
For the characteristics of our country, we have two motors.
The first motorbike is the one who did the experiment in the '50s, the pictures of the companies.
Let'songe on being, the smallest printing media, something that isn't useful, not efficient, doesn't paragonable to large internationals.
They are likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change, they are agile, they are speed, they are pictures.
They can do something extraordinary that is "Made in Italy," they have a quality and eccellence in the production of service, in the production of products.
It's quite united in their company, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to insistently appreciate competences in this reality, because these reality can become renewable multinationals of the "Times Foundation."
That is, those multinationals that can be used.
A segmented interaction.
The market, extraordinaryly, generating ricks for all the texts around us, and this is the first as we have, the first great motorcycle, the second motorcycle that, above all, is its cultural heritage.
A heritage that nature, for its existential nature, thanks to Dio, is an analytical heritage, and it remains an analogical heritage, we can't digitalize our closset.
How can it be?
That tourists only visit three cities, Venezuela, Roman America, and then they returned.
But the ricks of these three cities don't do it.
No, the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've taken the time to start, but we're speed to recover.
including this heritage.
Within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it and make it notable, and to bring the tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our countries.
And I believe that this is your great enhance that we can.
Fare is our Italy.
[A.DE.]
For me, in a certain sense, it's the opposite of the word.
What does this mean?
Well, all this.
It's our discomfort.
It's the opposite of the word "scale."
Because I will not talk about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, I'd like to start in a new way.
What's it?
A question.
But if someone asked you?
Let's open the crap.
According to you, in the last 15 or 20 years, we will say, in the 21st century, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of the world's citizens have increased or are decreased.
But I believe most of you would answer.
Well, they've increased, if you've become journalists, maybe you'll agree.
The prezemologic aggressive has increased exponentially.
It's me.
And I ask you, "But is it in Italy?"
Well, maybe the answer of many would be.
Keep calm!
I am...
I've been asking these questions for the last years.
And how?
But only 24 hours is the video source.
I'm prepared.
My colleagues, a rapport.
about inequality?
From that moment on?
From when they are data, that is, fundamentally, from 1960.
But for the vast majority of countries in the world.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve.
This of the abandonment of inequality in the world's citizens, as you can see, was indeed an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but in the beginning of this.
And from the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 90s.
The aggressive inequality in the world's citizens is crossed and precipitated.
Then we are at the storic mining, and in Italy.
GV: In Italy?
So, the victims of inequality are quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically.
From the beginning of the second Republica.
CR: We have a trend of inequality in the growth.
How can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is that of saying: we've entered a complete alcohol shell, because we've continued to talk about years of increase of inequality as much as it seems.
The data doesn't have it.
And they supported our feelings.
And there's certainly the truth in this lettura.
But we could also ask another question: What if the feeling of an increase in inequality that many of us are ourselves?
It's still like this.
But the feeling wasn't wrong.
But maybe it's wrong?
Well, the idea of inequality, of which ...
G.G: There's nothing.
[A.DE.]
We need to reflect on the concept of inequality, what we try to say about inequality, maybe the concept of inequality.
But it requires some time to take it back.
Do we do it?
Time went on to the subsequent question.
And let's move around a century.
And also in this case: we moved to Cambridge in 1928.
One year before the big crisis of 29: Lickens.
Cambridge was set, a speech was pronounced.
S: Davi.
QD: There is a public of students, a speech, which was well known as the title "posibility economical" for our budgets.
At that time, Keynes forms two profiles.
KP: The first one says.
It was a sector of productivity.
So one hour worked.
That's it.
QD: Otto times that of today, meaning of 1928.
And this profile, indeed, is realized, because if you're about to engage.
There are the richest remains of the economy.
Effectively, in the majority of society, we have it.
An increase of productivity around 100 years which is also DDP.
QD: Well, twelve times, in some cases, 15 times.
This teacher is there.
Well, it's achieved.
But from this professor Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, meaning that humanity ...
Little by little, that's where you can say slowly to 100 years.
It would be found with a huge amount.
The free time, would it have?
Yeah!
It's working less.
She also said to her to work on everybody, and when she told her that she didn't want much less, she wanted a week of 15 hours of work.
Or a volunteer?
With three hours of work every day.
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynes was asking, but with all this free time, we could use it well or not.
G.G: Well.
Apparently, this second trust didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't all work.
And it doesn't seem like we work three hours a day.
But me ...
I'll be able to notice that this teacher is divided into two parts, there is one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false.
But first, we will work much less, we will work three hours a day.
And we're confident that it's not.
We removed from anywhere, we went to see those successes in Italy.
This one is...
Kurve, this trajectory represents.
But the fraction of time?
What is an average Italian?
(Laughter) To work through your life.
Your life naturally, potentially working, meaning for 15 years, then ...
(Laughter) I love it.
Not to offer a job.
Well, if we keep this trajectory?
The professor of Keynes, in reality, has been achieved because we reached the beginning of 19900 almost 40% of the time in our lives.
to work, and now?
But we call it around 16%.
The interesting thing is that this 16%.
Fattoos.
Two hours and a fourth a day, which means the three-hour neighborhood in Italy we already sponsorated it.
Surely?
Well, if this has happened, there are also relevant reasons and if you want banals.
For example, the elderly is highly burned.
Because we live a lot after life expectancy and those who succeeded in something like 27 years.
It's from the beginning of the year 19900.
There is another very positive reason.
And other margins, if you want.
Our children.
So many studies, studies long, are studied up to 25 and 30 years, so even young age is launched.
Yes, but there is a reason, maybe, more fundamental, for that.
FdB: Our quote of time?
According to work, it's true.
AD: And that's it.
The trafficking rate, that is, the number of people.
AD: What job?
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion.
It's this storic, dramatic series, because you can see it.
Why?
In the beginning of the seventh, in the whole monarchical ocean.
And before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even more.
I hope it's more than 70%.
AC: Today.
We are very low, around 50 percent scared.
Let's wait.
KP: From 1968 we accepted a year.
The occupation rate has always been lower than 50%.
G: But a range of occupation?
But it improves 50%.
What does that mean?
It means there are more people who don't work, not the people who work.
The pure consumers who don't perceive any income.
Behind, I'm more workers.
FdB: Is the frontier of this?
Fattoos.
Storic.
CR: We can also have a reaction?
It's enthusiastic, meaning.
But what about this?
AC: And progress is beauty.
(Laughter) It's modernity.
Things have been like this, because we can't lose it.
But then let's see?
If in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have gone the same way, because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States.
And then we see the confront.
It's funny.
In Italy.
And it was united.
This is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while it's about us.
But more impressive is the storic number of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There is an increase, what you can see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general trend of the occupation rate in the United States.
But in the argument, in our case, we have.
a situation.
[A.DE.]
Riduation.
It's the taste of occupation.
But then that?
One of them is a pathology.
Well, it's not normal.
- Okay.
Yes, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
But it's not normal that the majority of people ...
I was in a sentence that I defined.
That's it.
Dipendence in parassity, in addition, because from the way to your wisdom depends.
This can also be a family member, the State.
But would it stop because I consume?
I have the available income without working.
I'm a friend who does it?
But when did I find these results?
We were at the scene and I asked them.
Nonsense.
I would quickly introduce this situation with an image, a situation of parassitary dependence.
And he, do you know what he did?
With Epopopopopotentus, is that influence?
It's on the backs of Epoto, but it's called buffago, some say buffaga, etc.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The buffer, or the buffaca on the hypothms, or on other great mammals, these whales also live on the roots.
In the buffs, well, we have this film.
Because it will be there for some seconds in which you see.
[A.DE.]
So, animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
Scattering.
With the resources that the buffler provides, which are insetti.
The ZEC tree, all that.
Because Alberga.
And at the back of the hell it's not clear.
If the bottle account, no, the ears ...
The mistake may mean that it's playing or that it's harmful for the eye, even if it's not.
(Laughter) This is it.
Well, what's happening in nature, but I'm not a psychologist, I'm a sociologist, so the question that I've asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another one.
But how can we define a situation like this?
A society where there is a majority of pure consumers.
It's a minority of producers, how do we define a society in which ...
There is this kind of improductive consumption.
But then I said to myself, "But this is the sign language society?"
And society, signals, like feudal society in which there is a ceiling.
- Okay.
He searched to live without working.
[A.DE.]
Naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
Well, this is indeed a conviction.
What can be defined?
In a signorious society, but a society that's useless.
A: Yes.
Why?
Because consumers are more than producers.
And in the signural society it's simple, classical: we have the sign and the servos of the Greek that occurs for him.
It's in society.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission in a massive society.
Things are a bit more complicated: ladies, I've become many.
"Yes."
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated.
I create Dubezon, a great anthropologist.
I know that the idea defines a doppio-like relationship, we can see why.
CR: Let me read, why?
FdB: The relationship?
The buffer with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage.
But it's also dependence because it depends on food.
What's it?
It's a background.
An Indian faces.
Don't take off.
And also from the view of the producers, we have a new facial friction and a veracity.
Epopotentama is autonomous, it doesn't need a buffer.
So, in some way, it's a memory of obligation, like we are in the faces of color that we keep.
Because we can't, we can't Epopopowerus.
They don't nourish the killings they live.
On top of our shells.
So the situation is very complicated, and this is a situation of interaction, but it's a situation.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation.
What about the project?
A new problem of inequality, and now we come.
That's the question I had made talking about Keynes.
Today, perhaps, the real inequality?
And the inequality of access to work.
Access to work is very essential in our social system, but if inequality is?
And access to work we can use the tools.
It's the birth of inequality, that is to calculate a coefficient.
of genetic concentration, which is the tool with.
Why if we measure the desigualdad, can we?
Explain the work: there are people.
They don't work, those with the means of work, who have a job, who have two workers.
And the position of the art, in this scale, of inequality, of access to work, is dramatic.
The position of the universe, right?
(Laughter)
At the same time.
The agriculture is waking up, together.
Alla Turchia?
In the country where inequality reaches mass, but simply because there is the inclusion of women, if we were an Islamic country, probably.
But we would have the palm of this.
It's the best situation, that of Norway.
Well, with the United States.
Messi in the middle.
Are you missing?
To become an Ox country, normally, 7 million plastic positions.
But how did we get to that?
This is the story.
Before, the inequality of access to work in Italy is always measured with the efficient dignities.
Do you see something funny?
That inequality is the mining, during anarchical episode, particularly under the faster.
And it's huge in public schools particularly under the second one.
It's the one we live in.
There are 7 million ports missing.
If we had seven million more jobs?
Our families.
You would accept it.
1000 euro per month, and moreover, we could generate around 12,000 euro per month.
In the year, and our state would be around 150 billion euros as much as health and school has been put together, more or less in Italy.
I've just done it.
"There's a bit."
AC: Hi.
We have the scholarship of scrutches.
The first articulum of Costituation: "Brazilian is a democratic republic based on work."
But we are the only Paese.
Who has this in the first one?
It's the small town of the Constitution, and we're the biggest country together with Turkey.
A: Hello.
That's why.
But, or change things.
We believe it.
7 million jobs positions are missing.
Or maybe it's better to download the article one of the Constitution.
Because, when things are like a birds.
Children.
