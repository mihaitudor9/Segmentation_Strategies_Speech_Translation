(Applause) Youelve found power and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what these two words have to do apparently so far away: Be, do you know that, until some time, my two largest children, Mars and French?
And, in addition, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
The words were fatal to get out of there, they were blocked in their pockets.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune.
There was a little town called Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
You'll ask a child, whatever happens.
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
And then...
The young man thought...
I am not the ones [A.DE.]
Interesting?
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, can you imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor?
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble, right?
But the wish of this young man to try the battles he had written, the fought comics was too big, and he didn't think: free of the surgeon, took the microphone and said, "Salva todos, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the internet that my first words as I was born were: web, web!
That's how it happened.
People were laughing.
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That this young man, at that time, was that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And after all, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, "This is a bit the problem of having the Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility...
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What's a moment, I talk about my flexibility and they take away the best part.
This also works the opposite.
Is it then?
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
The 21st trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, that's an obsession, but our son is a mask and a female." (Laughter) the doctor says, and, unfortunately, she didn't understand, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
The doctor is always more spoused, nearby, and my wife answers, "I understood this great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
It's a feminine.
Then I say to myself, "A misery carrier, we don't even know what we were able to do the NELA mask, but it's dark."
(Laughter) The doctor we gave the alarm to the doctor, because ... (Applause) Thank you.
We keep moving much about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not supermarket, after a few months.
Anna has arrived, it's the present, it's a marvelous one, it's very beautiful, it's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
What if this isn't the power?
But we have noticed one thing: that all the people we meet are all very informed from the technological point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all hundreds of villages, of analyses, we know everything, but few, very few of these people have had encounters with people, with disabilities, and then, without taking much more seriously, not even for anything, but for nothing.
And then we carried out this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use it, but you know from one of them as a physician" We meet the good news that bring us, for example, a little while ago, "Sother, come home," saying, you know you're wearing a gold at school.
So this part is here.
Or another one, where he says: "But it's true that you suffer from Down syndrome and you don't wear blue eyes," "Bella, this is said with Down syndrome," because we believe that even words have their importance, and even because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome more, I don't know, I'll give you an example, you have a TED talk.
Have you made a small X?
(Laughter) (Applause) No, why am I giving you this example?
And to know TED, a very small advertisement, but I invite you to talk to people, you've done a little bit of fat, and don't avoid the meetings of disabilities that will have in your life, both persons, but also from people around you.
That's what I want to do.
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to give us a step forward, a grader underwater, here, in order to wake up the eyes, you have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me to often lose.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to try to trace disability.
In your life, to enroll them, and especially ...
And remember that the pairs...
What can you look at the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like Maoce, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And this has opened my mind, it has made me change the prospective, and from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, but for an orchestra, it was me, it could be an intern, because it was my mission in the world somewhat sustainable, starting from food.
Because it's food, and not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food decisions are usually a large part of our daily environmental impact: if we want to translate it with an indice, we could talk, for example, of ecological pressure.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
But my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that is environmental impairment, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
And then, obviously, to try to use 100% of the raw materials.
Another thing of consumers also is to optimize consumers, and especially the way in which we compose the bact every day, theattoo, so, what are we, effectively, bringing it to the cake?
I'm part of this project, I'm part of this project, so from the meeting with the suitcase just from the fine of the file, rejects, from what we usually use every day at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate them from one side there is scarce, scarce, so the less noble part is in average at least one among four ingredients, for example, the police.
I had a lot of implications, some chips, but I could also like it naturally, to make a cake, a cake.
And it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit certainly for health. This is just an example with a product that should be familiar with, to love 100% believing: for example, zucca loves me a lot, because the sewing is the only noble part, it's the one where you concentrate too much pain on the chicken, you can concentrate on the sew, but it's the same thing we all have at home and see with a different eye.
To use it as well to cure, and it's not just a creation, I'm sure that some of you are shooting the gear, but it's a very high-scale swimming technique, the bass temperature, so it doesn't happen that you can use a professional tool for 2,000 euros, but every time I cure the paste or the vegetables, and in the middle of the dark pieces, like always.
And truly, when they could add the table, for example, the cards, the cards and the fish, certainly a small effort from all of you, we have so much abundance, and we have a little tendency, and more importantly privileged, the animals with a low environmental impact.
Those of you might be wondering, well, in the next year we'll also be Expo, and there are me on food of the future, I can say so many insects, personally I believe I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you're agree with me, we're not just a consumer country of insects, and I believe we'll hardly become it, but, moreover, we can produce bones, surprised, and sorpressed, that I can't produce us, that I can't produce, we can produce our home, our home, our home.
Well, I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition, here in the room, who among you has never eaten lunch.
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, we had more foodmen than an athlete, about 35 years ago a law stops us from collecting them.
Because they have the influence at the world level, there are so much to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, you just need to know what to do: to save your trauma that at home is enough to have a little packaging, a gold, a bit of land, a queue, and not to make them scape.
The man who, in reality, comes alone, is enough to get rid of the inalated, or you can hide uova, so unite to me, in my opinion, not only the food of the future, but also the food of the present, sponsors that cook the vast, eat all the drinks, start a small change of mentality and benefits that really many are for us and for our planet.
(Music) The other has gone with ten gangs: if I turn it out any value from one to ten to the same probability of dancing, one has a common data with six gangs, you will be part of one to six.
Now let's play: you'll launch the side of ten gangs, I'll play it for you, bring this game, put it into an equal or largest number of mine.
(Audience): Yes.
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
Keeping with the fact the ten face is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
I explain to myself: a possible approach is based on the experience: I can launch data repeatly and take notes of every victory.
After 100 lights, I'll realize that coming to the seventy seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you'll see that the provedity of victory is only about 75%.
(Laughter) With the random increase, my stomach based on the average of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
But your portable has to deliver to release the number of 100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo methodo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
(Laughter) To dare to answer this data game, we didn't need any mathematics: a pure mathematician would remind the Monte Carlo poco elegant method, as if we were abused of the brutal force of computer.
To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago, I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
(Whispering) Now let me give you the data.
[Yes!]
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, or my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the orders of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and unbearable humanity.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
Dieters ITA see there are 1010 failed attempts, the dotted is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and which is based on innovative research.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time on my own, on the front of the computer or on a statistical background.
That's what I want to do.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion that I wasn't seen before.
So, here in movement, there's a topic that is based on an argument from a mathematician that studies west, but I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than we were, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how much, you think they're taught in Maths and in English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
Then I said, "But...
With that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, all that I had left before.
Why is that?
Because all that water ...
(Laughter) I didn't want to answer that question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to maintain this state of euphoria and that's how I accepted my degree, I started to live in lessons, and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to prepare solitary, I wanted to compare my students, get involved, and make them fun, I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
And then, it wasn't about work for me.
I did reviewing at every aspect of learning, preparing the process is a creative, stimulating process, a form of art.
I really like to correct the contents: to read the readers' reads, right tricky they are, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman.
And the open to each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
But the gratitude of the students paying all my bills, and I'm talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
(Laughter) In the cost of my PhD, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way.
(Laughter) It was all that natural, beautiful, brilliant.
In my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to address your own passions.
That's how I talked to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, fuel, the limitations of determination?
By the place I gave myself, I learned how to be and in values that I grew up with, the values that we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
My mind had started moving at the moment in which I had tried to put the lies of my students in motion.
(Laughter) In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
(Laughter) As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But let's see, and I told you this capital of my story, precisely because I think that what I learned is shared.
A method to explore this part, for example, the fact of intraprending a path that doesn't reveal what we thought, or find purpose and motivation through strings that there were no expectations, as catalizing our talents and the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
He invited me to teach.
(Applause)
It's an interaction lesson from financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom, I come in good eye, I laugh at the vegetable garden, my three colorful channels.
In his face of the time, I turn off the voice, there's already silent, and I explain that the exercise has cooperated will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl in the first row asked me if I could give some attention to the questions I asked.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night watching the kids of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have a final lesson.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had very little time for this practice, but there's a lot of material online, and there's a place to show it on the rear of the diagram.
Behind, I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
But every point in practice we created a theory element, that we repeat the issues together, someone asks a very difficult question, but I had a dinner of their gender book: "They're well prepared, I'm the cavo."
I work with them to make them take the spiral, a flight instruction, I bring them to the magnifying glass, but most of them are reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
The solved, he, sitting in talking, seems strange, maybe he's looking for the words just.
(Laughter) Anyway!
Take the courage, just to tell me.
We have to copy.
But I just want to thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
I only live in class, it's a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe this is exactly my place in this world.
(Music) Here, this is what I want to tell you: mind and heart are legached correctly, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside your pet, your mind is in movement, thank you.
(Music) In addition to the bathrooms, we financed, we were already researching, we put our bathrooms, and started to grow from the bathrooms, midgets, many of us moved, we held research, gathered all the month, and started to make a global movement for the world health programs.
(Applause)
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, so a little bit like Jesco saw in a bar by a book.
And as it was often a captain, while I read and while doing something, it started to make me some others, it started to listen to extreme conversations, then there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It was a central topic: Samatina my colleagues this year presented it in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, as everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
Your diversity, your diversity, your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing then?"
It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know how to go out, and the opportunity seems its data instead of diversity.
Everything that has brought a different back, remember one day my daughter:
And a mom home, we had a family of older friends, so at some point the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Clo, we are really three men?"
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly the straight below.
To do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and that's a bit the difficulty, but, if I want to create change leaders, that I've been working for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
And then, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
The word change thanks to this word change, I get a thinking that gives me that I don't know how many hours and starts putting into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and forming an encouragement, cake.
[A.DE.]
Kaching, which is actually a presa, is a bit of achievement that, in my opinion, clearly, this is a prosecutive of personal whole, a leader today of willing to know, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to take, but to be present and lead the change, to the cake is an act, and it is a creative, of transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis, the prospective change, what is it?
And in this being there is a means of transformation that will also lead to you, to be involved, it's not that I did a project, I've been paid on the project, but which is the transformation that has, and in this way I realize this thanks to the development of creative thinking, which is a bit of leading it to change this transformation.
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we have already imagined it through five fundamental pillars.
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talent people, to genius, exclusively to artists, or someone who may maybe take care of the workshops, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's issue, adds the environment in which you are.
(Laughter) And if that is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can join your creativity, what you do with creative thinking, try to work on divergent and convergent thinking, but that's not enough.
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve the emotional part, the face of emotions, we have heard of emotional intelligence first, here are those, when you know about your emotions, you can allow you to support judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing this ...
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a change of rule, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotion gives you to do this.
I'd like to mention the numerous examples of leader who have done these reports, just to get to the countryside, certainly deserve marriages with Rome, but also those with Milano, you know that they're awarded at the other day, like the world's major estension company, including innovation and is growing up to 67%.
Vere transformations have to do with, like saying, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you work, and so the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way.
Opportunity, we say in management, create the weather, but I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader?
To identify that with their behaviors they can create other things.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can have a free spiral, can, as to say, to relate to each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not always the same amount of organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were achieved only in one way, on the other, but to lead the opportunity to do that, to explore new discoveries.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and, in the end, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Will I convince me to collect creative spirit?
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, which is necessarily different if you don't interact with the organization, or about reinventing a very client's relationship because of that original cave...
So, the idea is exactly ...
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To find ourselves in the situation of being aware, to expand the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a way of liberating to say in which way today I can be curious, in that way, by looking at people, I can find something that isn't so comprehensive.
So the sense of attention we have seen in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking, but this assumes clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but especially that of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to allow permission.
To make things happen first inside you and then out, so in a few words, the courage to use, (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We're about to land, to drop your confidence belts.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance to see from above.
It's the most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention of man.
The city and it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
thousands of years near these places to be together, as well as mass.
They live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And you'll also have an important question to your forehead: But is it positive or negative?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not so much, and in fact, in this city, the longest process of history began with the most experienced feeling.
And the process is obviously the process of the city, and these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were living in Manchester, and they didn't see what today captivates you when you were doing your weekend, New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They used to be strade, without leaves, without poverty.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon particles also prevented one with the other.
And, of course, the two scribes with the book, called "the path of the operating class in the city."
In which the cities of all the bad guys in the world were the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon possible, it was like saying.
A malign behavior, something necessary, sometimes, but to contain, and from this, over the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent, there were also some disciplines of tools to limit this phenomenon, since it was probably the cause of all the problems of the world, an accent of science.
And astonishing that, maybe you've ever heard about those with bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock for which, when you've changed a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who has even arrived to say and to pretend to imagine a centimeter of the city, what had to happen in the future, here a house, there was a trade, a theater.
(Laughter) And then, we also imagine films, the culture that impacts a lot in the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an uncontrollable isolation, a city full of violence and tender, so much to drop it, and maybe for those who watched the movie, you remember, it becomes a business where all the world's rationals are launched at thealto and scanned forever.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all processes, maybe even for us a little lungh, from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
This is the solution that motivates this ability, the city of improving the world, the first elementary to all the big questions made by environmental sustainability, confidence and economical development, the ability to create knowledge.
See which my mirrors were my photo made from the ups of my city and density.
And the second is diversity, and the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, the more imagination can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse, that there are few richer, people from all over the world, people call socks other people who also ignore me the most famous calling.
And stage frighting is creativity: this is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Then, here's my idea, that the city as a solution is, in some way, add to the end.
It's really a mechanism.
The city works, and resolves the greatest question of humanity, because as a black scat: the mass, the people, we're all used to confront this other city for the abundant, for the bigness, for the PISA, a product.
A great mechanism that transforms.
I've interacted differently.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, with such individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as it has succeeded in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status, now we know all some cities, even in Italy, even bigger.
(Laughter)
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Or others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that in this moment or in some periods?
You begin to be...
This virtuous mechanism, and then we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to move from mechanisms of urban phenomenon to mechanisms and tools that develop development and give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and who have no fear, but who is trying to feed this mechanism.
Sparing the big thing: the first example is Mility, and this is an image from the top of the city, of the satellite, and are evident that some groups are not all, but with utopia and courage.
That was my idea together.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years, with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
to name this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city, like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 kilometers of green, a vital stage, that each day can imagine, can imagine, as a element of diversity and strength.
Creating in the positive things of the systems we live in, not allowing us to fight against the newspapers of traffic, which is still invoking, before the absence of solution, of cities like natives.
It comes to the cement.
The second example is that in the place of a city, I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires, Argentina, the capital, more than in other countries it's the head of all over the nation, the place where everyone has a chance, but this mechanism, the city definition I've proposed, it's a quesit, a few years ago.
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation what was it?
Do you eat alone?
The ability to limit development, and instead of courage, shaping up, with the same ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, which are the cities.
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies: three strategies that accelerate development.
Most infrastructure and the creation of spaces, pedestals, or wages, you can see this ...
It's density, the piano grows in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build.
Wearday more basis with more dense rooms?
Changing the population not only of the aggentine, but from all over the world, and the creators to gather together, and then build a system of infrastructure.
Also, suffering allows us to increasingly believe in this development and to accelerate them, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
From green and pedonal spaces, when I was the solution to everybody and to the world, so these three strategies together focused on the development of Buenos Aires.
Ancorates a time.
Atterrete.
And maybe choosing the position at the end, you will see it from the upset, this great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe...
You're proud to live in what I call the city section, thank you. (Applause) Thank you.
(Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause)
The words are important.
They put us in ideation.
It wasn't our thoughts.
The words of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They're evocating that they're full of stories and vibrations, of emotion.
I'm a son.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Again.
I'll talk to you about the mountain way.
The English idea: provincial and emotional mixing, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago ...
They started to become common.
But did he get a bit like this?
And will I start to show you?
Some negative twists.
They have motivated on their designs and the largest universities in the world.
And they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a cone, and there's a Latin motto in Ghana, in Codia, in Eduzia.
In Syria, in the leg united to the Kiss College of Ronda and the Uxford Round.
Chicago, the United States, Harvard, says "gotten" in his insurance, not just universities.
Honestly.
Dichiarian, if you were in Latin "Eh".
Londra has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
Kinsland, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: the American Marina says, "Sempen lastelli, if you've always heard of it in film, the British marine speaks in Latin, and there's no instruction to be transatist like NASA."
It releases a Latin motto when I emissioned to chicken.
But why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
That's not the case.
Well, have you seen it?
On the other hand, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality?
And this ... (Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we have to say, "Room, me and you, Wow, Mendyu," what is this subsidiary of ugly lega?
What is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each of us: "They're with the five pallets high" (Laughter) (Applause)
And one is asked.
But why, but because at the moment that I take, if we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there's no one who makes the insensite thing to settle their name.
I was promising.
It's no part of it.
Just Doma.
"Daddy, dad, you have your penetration."
Let's take a look at the tourist gate (Applause) A lightened pile.
This is the Ministry of Benicuto, you're seeing beautiful.
Risconta?
(Laughter) No, it's not really nice to see, Beautiful, "So, we're Italian people in a way of insensitating things, don't even like an anglophone, what?"
It's curious, it's this one.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
I've been from Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic ancestors, in habits.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses, study, or because they love it.
For the pool, for the opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
I know what I did.
We are talking about the language of angels.
(Laughter) Second.
Nevertheless.
For example, pizza?
It achieved the world continuing to call us pizza.
(Laughter) Here you see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map that sell hamburgers or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And she says "Pizza."
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
(Audience) Yes!
Well, here's here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote the week of Italian wine, I say, "OK" (Laughter) Because the ristors of New York...
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
Wow!
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food, let's talk about fashion.
This is what works at the Italian River's office.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the Winter Flow.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
(Laughter)
Please stand up and ask you who has told me.
(Laughter)
Hunger rings, as if it were a mountain road in Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
Like they are at our Devenery.
And the women we see in our mental births.
Why, "you"?
But if there are women, they are not the curves.
We dare to talk about publicities, old people, adertising, anyway, this one ...
It's the publicity of a vecture of not in Spain and speaking, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment in the bedsima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
(Laughter) This is the same payment in Italy and it spoke English: there are only two Italian words: the first ... (Applause)
What's happening to us, if even the union... (Laughter)
He says, "Let's look at our radicies we love."
The Argentinians say, "I'm on the Internet."
Riolniance.
The radicies of the Cathitalian jungle, right?
We are segmented.
Here's the curious thing, because between two Italians who don't like it's an English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) So, I'll wait to you that medical abilities of what I'm doing.
It's compiled by the sign who has compiled this formula's model, as an advantage of linguistic competitions.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are controversial.
We use a quantity of English words.
There's no one.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasion, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The nazzle is the "locker" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
In the ufficies you can feel, we must give a shower of toothpastes uniting from the caste to be satisfied.
(Laughter) It's a joint with business.
(Laughter) (Applause) When I'd just say we should call "Pipo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because the unit is always kind, flat and general business.
It says "glese" and "mails" only talk about it in companies, but also in media, public administration.
The Govern.
We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset didn't have much fun.
And I have forced the pictures of Giobatt's newspapers, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
In English, that there will be no more sympathetic, because it has an English name.
"Wow, that's it!
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman wedding?
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To raise awareness and mining about this problem.
(Laughter) Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
It's a bit of energy, this appetition?
who invented it.
Public public records, the government, the companies, the media, say it, in Italian.
And the ratio, firstly, at the Cusca Academy, because it did, became protagonist of this sensitationalization company: did we expect?
A discovery point, but not what happened.
In less than a month they signed, putting names, names, nurses, nurses, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, polygloppies and people who didn't spouse that the engineer has signed directors and students, signed careers.
The Italian teachers and English teachers signed up professional trenders and called pensioners, signed Italian signals in the west saying, "What are we doing to teach our language?"
To a movie is the whole world.
From Singapore, from Jerus Jalem, it gives me "Peduda," "African girl," "No from Africa."
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
Open.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
I'd like to make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a twist, we are in the novel of flash, if we think abundantly, we talk about other tango scoritably, working in a public recording, helping.
But because I've studied classic studies, "No, I have to work with economists."
(Laughter) A great Italian and an English decent: "I'm better than a script, the Talinglese, Sisher, I work in fashion, I've received a retired apple, an overwhelming of the trend, I don't think there was.
And we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but Italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
(Laughter) So I started to let me talk about our language decades, because I'd never like to say, I felt of years and functions that occurred. (Applause)
For Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, in Paese, in Bianjardi, Bernata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to speak about Table's bubbles, but they fill up the Company bow, but you do, and that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
(Laughter) We run out because I have heard about teachers and universities that say displegated, but visualized.
"I'm filming because I don't know the insult" (Laughter) (Applause)
That's why I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody would finally take these initiative to 85 years, thanks for engines.
This is how we said, an extraordinary transversal echo, because in mass communication, they established this thing of zero cost, on the Internet.
And the un amplified one.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a disorder and imaginable consensus.
They talked to them together, grammares and silk on the paper only about public, they were worthless applause, but also of hospitalization and welcoming.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
It hasn't talked about Christian family, the Turing's menchine, has spoken today that the behind has made a heritage: a transversality, right?
"Ca!"
And it is estimated all social resources, a little bit of core and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and put them to the most populated ones.
And many times, I'm the great wish to tune ourselves with the Portuguese and with consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional places, and it has also touched me put food and bear PLAG, it was interested in an Australian radio, a lion.
Well!
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracia, because it makes us understand a fact of democracia.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the agend, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, besides, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
The mail passes.
And then, he was called Leonardo.
In the first of the interviews of this newspaper?
Leonardo who defined himself "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he was scratching in flat, in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign and express one of our pecuriarities.
Deleflettesity.
The magnificent potential of our most Italian creativity, which has radicized in your mother language.
What's more, if our linguistic status is strong and used to it, we can attach some term strange, why personality?
But we need to fix it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
With a lot of thickness we must have an excess.
To finish, or to evil, why do I say this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thank you. (Applause)
(Music) What does it mean to be a young player?
When a face starts to look bad, the attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
I started to look bad if still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young woman, like everybody went to school, I ran around and fought with friends, but what is behind these photos that you don't see?
First of all, I would like to take a step back to you, to always start from the beginning.
And if I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
(Audience) Yes!
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bringing it together, and when one in two parents and everyone else is a kid, a teenager, they are your reference points, it becomes really complicated.
[A.DE.]
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
(Applause)
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sensations of harm, fear, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they end up again: the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
The difficulty to concentrate is also having to look at domestic facencies, as to do the thesis, or to hang around with hammeries, they're the nicest lines, or to talk to the doctors and to manage therapy.
Or, to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your parents could have, but in addition to this, they could manage the voices and their emergencies, where no one has ever prepared to do it.
But how do we add all this?
So I had to keep doing my life as always, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another character, that often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your good mother, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and determined to ereditate the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your mother have a shepherd disorder, a bipolar a schizophrenia, or if there's even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, mum, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect; even today it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and for you that if children, the doctor, becomes even more heavy.
[Yes!]
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside you and family members, stigma, prejudice, envyment can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What was behind those photos that wasn't visible behind that smile, there was a crown that came to be automatically formed, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rab and tears, and to prevent me from getting rid of the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing the things of all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade started to watch the first person stuck out of the family, the stories of our children of parents with mental disorder are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me that we have in common, and that we often invite us to experience it, that there's no other way, that we've lived the same things that we've experienced the same things we've experienced.
But through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've tried and understand that were natural the reactions I've experienced, but I've also been able to see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent man, by myself, I went to Vancouver in Canada, for the first conference I mentioned, and the wish is that any child, a teenager, a young adult, had to feel only when one in the books start to suffer from a psychological disturb, but also to write their history that I've experienced, but also the story of writing, their view, their view, their view, their story, that I've seen, they've seen, they've seen, they've seen, and still wanted to write, but they've also wanted to write, their stories, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, they wanted, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, their path, they wanted to write, their path
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017 with other Italian children, I went to Carlo and Marco, we started to start the first Italian association, children for other children, and it's called "Come, PCilde, Noff Mentaly, Parence, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
We've given the way to a project that has gone from the bottom, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room right now, who have grown up in this same desire, they have given us the influence to start, from parents' children, with a mental disorder.
At first, when I thought about this project, I was detailed, I'd never make it realised how I'd do it, how I annoyed, but I asked to help people around me, also to the scursionist guides, proposing to tell them during a floating in ten minutes the history, and now we managed to reach so many regions, from the sewing until the Switzerland, and we don't stop, we want to reach them all, and find them like ...
To those who are positive and negative emotions, the marks of life, being disenged, before having a mark of atoms to move on, it's too bad to save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
It's something I know.
And one of the positive characteristics that parents with mental disorder we have is willing to change their scope, and that's why I know that those kids will make them fulfill their desire, and also thanks to you, we learn together with the gate that for us was not open, let's get the light, thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
Today I want to talk to you about a special person: Aaron Sfarz, when they have dedicated a documentary last year, last year, in 2014 the internet on-boy year, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category: it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher; I'll surely play a hacker in a sense of sound.
It's an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
(Laughter) Four years ago, they were in a group that scratches the eye, maybe you don't say much, but it was a bit in the framework until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today the Creative Commons are around a part of content, they are free licenses, they believe the most flexible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
A few years later, a small start-up to build something that co-founds something called reddit, becomes millionary from one day to the other, with the interretarchive and open-livery, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving the web, because it would limit enormously the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What in the sand is absolutely overwhelming is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curiosity.
Aaronna told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 year old books: all the messages of the economy to the political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
[Yes!]
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge, in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn how to learn, he tells his mother that, at some point, she was swimming, and aaron was only two and a half years old, in the segelon, and he had the honor of the fridge she had just attacked with the socks.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demands the blogs to synchronize each other, the creators are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
The access of information comes from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information, that we just need to think a second.
Information, it said from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
Which means creating a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education learning, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
The fact that Aron comes to this genius which he is, this comes from his cultural background, which is the one of theker as a other, not as a distress, when he knows the code and has the abilities to read it, you can modify it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
(Applause)
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So, if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so, fundamentally, they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
(Laughter) But you don't do this as you are: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become an erotic actor, but you become a collective building act.
(Yes)
None.
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in what is called Open Hazes.
And they created great movement for access to scientific literature, very few big publishers have the keys of power making scares what scares isn't, that is, scientific information.
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
(Laughter)
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
ASBAI has taken care of it, not a hacker of this genius, it probably hasn't been watched, it understands that its opportunity to do that Aaron's cake.
An example: they want to give you an example to show all hackers out of the world that the world doesn't change with a pair of code.
(Laughter) That's how aromine is made of a veracity and its maturity persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats and could do it, but not in this scenario, it risks up to 35 years, it spends millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first army, anon stood at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
(Laughter)
The point is that power knows it, that power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people who wanted to access information, regarding the contrary.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
(The audience sends a soccer shower) (Laughter) You know there's... (Laughter) (Laughter) You know there's what there is.
They're facing everyone and the ones from them arrive.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) I think if you talk about percussion... (Laughter) Ah, yes, I ask you to do this.
And what about it?
The immersion is a little more important because Swraiability is Scatle, it's Streetland, Streetland, it's Spotlight, it's Spotlight, it's Spotlight.
And then, how do you do it?
Right?
INESDAN is a good starting gap between a month, it's still a tape, it's an enormous and overwhelmed unlessness, it's one of the anticipal media, of an embber, and not a pink.
[Inglese] Papchias, the last year I was over, this is the first time I love to elaborate a sign, right?
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two polarized internet prospectives, horrible Internet.
I wanted to end the same, I wanted to live in both, things that coexist in the same way: the Internet is too complex to be just one thing, because the Internet will always be that complicated thing.
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
The life's life is not something that will be: if there's one here already, the hell we live in every day, which we form is together.
Behind, there are two lines to not suffer.
The first achievement has many things: accepting hell and becoming part, until the point of not seeing it anymore, as the risky requires attention and learning continues to try and recognize who is, in the middle of hell, it's not hell, and make it harder and give you space.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, breast, well.
Well, then, if life had appeared, it was overwhelmed, no, it had made a reason, one afternoon all, then in 1950 that could stay in the intelligent species wing, incredibly closer to our sole, the oldest in our Sun, incredibly more advanced from the point of view, which are all how many, and we are not alone.
I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, before or after, in life, I at least do it forever, and I really believe that finding evidence that there is life outside the Earth would be an epocentric change for our species, for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
For so many centuries, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, a seventh and half ago, Charles Darwin, has explained that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come, and we all split from a paragonable unit, perhaps even better, from the other two.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps forward in the vocation of a possible answer, not yet we have it, an answer, but we are the first human beings to be carried.
And from the penets we know, in reality, we also know that many of them we know thousands of planets, so we're talking about gigantic numbers that are, there are the giant distance from their shelves, to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so of sea and oceans, on their surface, and, indeed, irritable, but we have tools that are, much probably, in a future not too far, not too far, too far away, we could predict in this light, that there are, in this light, in this light that there are, in this light that there are, that there are plenty of sea and oceans, that are more potentially, that there are plans, and potentially.
That all of us can be testimonies at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I really believe that there would be 74,000 years on our planet, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the fastest speed consent in nature, this space probe to reach the closest to our lives, for all of us.
It takes more than four years to give an answer to the interrogative of females, and then the interrogative in reality that we all have is right where there are all how many, and the fact that we have here is time, and so it's all very complicated, maybe we are not alone in the universe, and the other arms are incredibly farther than that.
And then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here.
The dinosaurs appear here at the right of the right hand, there's the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complicated facts of a life of billions of cells, animals, plants, dinosaurs appear here at the end of the dating palm.
And at the beginning of the last speech, a natural catastrophic event, very likely to have the impact of a great asteroid, the space between three quarters of living species at that moment on the planet.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, it was a long journey, we needed to necessarily bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, it wasn't necessarily supposed to bring to the origin of intelligence, and not that it should lead to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a little the key of all as if one day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will treat microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrians could be simple batteries, the seed might be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be very, very incurable, since without leaving any track in the universe, perhaps this time in life is in the case of the universe.
Great cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a little bit of advertising, maybe we are saying something: life had to overcome...
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine if we're seen from the universe, no one would ever realize that we've been.
We are a very young species, just a few years ago, we started to fly, to communicate through radio, from a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we reached the confines of the solar system, but, at least, in part, the opportunity to change, to influence our destination.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key of these free intelligences is to survive the highest possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space, then I think that even more we have the need to keep access until we have this faith, for example, in a small planet, lost in the midst of the cosmos, thanks to it.
(Music)
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport of victory, not from the sport of those who came first and classified, but from the fact that sports creates positivity and positive things for others.
The strength to move forward, the strength you think will give us the strength to think.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 km, which later became 100, I joined two, because Centro Quattro is another issue: no, I don't even agree with you two, because the six is a number that will come back in more moment, long this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All the participants that instead of running, instead of being worried about coming the first or the last few, we all arrive together, after these 16 hours of travel, have enough difficulties for which I chose this kind of garage.
(Laughter)
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
(Yes)
This is the first cover, the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 kilometers all of us, we do them during our performance, but the desert is general, the rope is a bit like the metaphor of life.
Later, during life, imprevists, and even in the crop, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a garage, whether it's time to do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the opportunity to react, and I'm the first difficulty I've had after three kilometers.
(Laughter) And some things seems to me, "Wow, let's do..." I'm a bit golden, OK, I've got it." (Laughter) "Spportished, I never live." (Laughter) "OK, I'm like this."
For this reason, I couldn't mold, because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to pick up basic income for the highway, there are many many, which, in this moment, are still male.
Many hot people: in the desert I've had various problems, in the brains of bruciature, it scores work stories of unity we have, but I've always shown a grades, and I don't know if you know that with salary, during the cover that started to shave even the ground security, the hot, that there is in a bit more lung, and there's nothing more dramatic, and I don't know if you know, but, unfortunately, with sail.
The anamibia desert is the desert that I chose because inside the desert of Namibia, there's the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters high, and when you're at high, it's an incredible thing: sometimes we feel good, how fortunate we are, and so when you're at high, it's an incredible thing.
(Sigh) We're already in Chile, the Cape Town, which also corresponds to a pack of the world here in Namibia and the real sky now.
(Whistles laughing) Yesterday, I was delighted, (Laughter) Around Chileans when I'm doing two other two. (Laughter) They fight for everyone who's giving you strength and travel, go for it, go for it.
(Music) [Inglese]: OK, okay.
I found, in the desert, even when stamattina was also talking about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, other than 26 people, because there was no such a girl with so many contents, 96 were never in TSE, and 96 people who crossed with me at the end of the last year of these geometers.
[Yes!]
And so, this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed the sideline to give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician cabin, you can go back, do the other Chilean to go back, to reach 1006.
Because the project had the opposite idea, that, to reach these Chileans' bells, it's really inside, in the number two, a number one, and recurring, the interesting thing is that we arrived at the end and the moneycut, 206 km, or 100x2.
But I wasn't like this: well, I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all of them, don't worry, you can also run away, I was just like this, maybe a little more.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
When I had times captured people to think about it, and I was surely facing 100 meters and I was already tired:
I wasn't alone... (Applause) (Cheers)
Look: "Haha".
Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the day of school, so three years difference, this is the first day of school, and nothing, Riccardo where he already understood this, it's the situation, but unfortunately, life sometimes looked at us difficult things, I'm no longer big, it's Riccardo who's already 10 to 7 years old, and the other Pietro who must go to the quarter and Pietro, in the first elementary.
It's a bit like the race, what I've just mentioned before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
AC: This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating episode, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this celebrating hemorrhage was caused hardly, and this is the last time I saw it smiling.
(Sigh) And ...
When I looked ...
(Laughter) So, when it seemed like everything was going well, February 18th, 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too dumb.
Surely, the Chamber called Ranna, 116 Chitro, you've understood the number 6.
That's not the case.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression, but in these moments ...
(Audience) Yes!
You don't have to wait for it, because remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed there, and Riccardo continues to move forward and give the chance to the other two who arrived: he got to Emma, he's never arrived on the 29th July in San Pietro, but you have to continue (Applause) but you have to keep going!
(Audience) Yes!
And eventually Michele arrived, from 18 months later, so there were them, we had to absolutely be me, stronger, and so I had to do that, to manage to create or improve my life, to improve my way, not only from the physical point of view, but above all, to give people strength, and finally get to this garage.
I ended up arriving in the desert of Namibia, where, since these 16 Chileans brought me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you can see the perfect there.
It's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
And this year in November went to the Omann desert and Chileans will be 165 so I got only water, we came here, we waited to get to the end, but the desert is diverse, but the opposite is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them to do better.
It's all the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always hoping for everyone to do a lot of things and to keep going (Applause) Thank you.
And today we are here.
And today, it's 17th of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everything. (Applause)
