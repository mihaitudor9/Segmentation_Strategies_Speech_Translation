Did you find it?
Powerness and fragility.
Anyone of you will know what to do, these two words apparently far away.
Well, you must know that until some time ago my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to fall asleep they chose two words, and me on those two words I had to tell a story.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little kid, the kidneys, I'm empty, but intrappolated from a terrible incarcer: the words were tired to go out and stay in your hat.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, she found a little girl.
And this little girl says, "Daddy, I'm not..." His name was Teresa, the boy thought, "I want a child, whatever happens to these freedom words.
I want freedom for my words, not yet in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
(Laughter) Because it was much easier to digital the words in front of a computer that is to write words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor, but imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the battles he had written, the comic fights, was too big, and he didn't think about it.
He went out for free of the barbecue, took the microphone and said,
I'm a computer engineer.
I was so brave online that my first words just before were born: web, web, exactly like that.
People liked it, and he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing.
But the most beautiful thing that this young man showed at that time was that people didn't laugh more than him, but they were laughing with him.
So one of my family would have interrocted me and would have said, "Yes, man, we've understood that you are."
(Laughter) And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say power.
Then, I thought, "Yes, guys, that's a bit the problem of having Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
(Laughter) But power doesn't stop us.
But first, I have to tell you something very important, because when I talked about my disabilities and my debility, something very strange happened: the people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen, in other words, were the best of themselves.
What?
What?
One moment!
I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
It's then that I became a volunteer at a house that opens people with disabilities.
What was it working?
Funti.
The people, all the people I've met, who have become part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But, as in all stories that respect each other, there is always a difficult moment, a bad moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little.
But for those who are a father or are becoming a father, well, the disability is the biggest one of the pairs.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Civil Hospital of Padova.
My wife and I were in the fifth grade.
A prosthesis makes us fill in a very small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only one wedding, and makes my wife fill.
Take the paper and the trisomy 21st, and the only thing I have in my ears are the words of the little girl in the soccer, at that point for me, the time lies: "Dombi and Frey."
(Laughter) The doctor says, "Yes, man, yeah, yeah, she may not be afraid," but her genius support is my wife, that says, "I'm a doctor, but our son is a master and a female, it didn't understand."
The 21st Down syndrome is the s√≠ndrome de Down syndrome, my wife answered, "I've understood pretty well.
But I just wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female, so the doctor is always more spoused, close and female, and then I say to him, "Oh, but it misery!
Now, we don't even know what we were able to do.
In other words, we have given the doctor's thesis to the doctor ... (Laughter) because ... (Applause) Thank you.
We know this thing a lot, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment.
The most difficult part of our lives.
I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyway, after a few months, it came.
"Listen here."
Good afternoon.
I'm telling you it's a marvel.
It's very beautiful, it's also strong.
I admit that mine is somehow a judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've become all the best people, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, somehow, find themselves.
And if this is not the power.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, particularly from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by speeds, analyses, we know everything.
But few, very few, of these people have had meetings with people, with disabilities.
And then, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Both newspapers of Anna," where so, without predicting too serious, but not at all, let's tell the news that bring us.
For example, a little while ago, Francesca came home and said, "You know you're using one as a physician at school, and then we did this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you may wear, but you know, how did you do that?"
Believe this one!
And you will be here, so this part here, or another one, where it says, "But it's true that you have Down syndrome and you don't have blue eyes?"
Believe appreciation!
And it's said "communication of Down syndrome," because we believe that words also have their importance.
Also, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in more.
I don't know, I'll give you an example: you have TED.
Hold a little X (Applause) No, why am I going to show you this example?
Because you, today, to know TED, to talk to people, have made a little bit of fat.
So, the invitation is to make a little bit of fatal and not avoid the disabled encounters in your life.
There are people around you, but there are people around you.
A very small advertisement, but in this path we can lose ourselves, because our hope is always the ones to give us a grader or a bound grader.
That's it.
And to look at each other you have to look at the same level.
And in this sense, it captivates me many times of losing.
That's why I like a modern man to leave briefs through my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon, with this sign, that the sign language is the word disability.
So I don't have to stop trying to trace disability in your life, saving them, and especially remember that the paintings that you could look at the front turn into courage.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I wanted to be a particular person, like Maoce, who could see or Gandhi.
One afternoon, actually, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life, and I understood what my mission was in the world.
In fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds or a romantic disorder, as some relatives have arcoded before, but for an orchestra.
She didn't go well, she could go further, because she was thanks to a sign, so I remember very fortunate.
Until many of you have access, while you've had an internship, to realize how scary each day is, how much scarce it is.
It's what happened to me one night thanks to a traffic.
This thing opened my mind, it gave me a little change of prosthesis.
From that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be nothing to find out and try to make the world a little more sustainable, starting with food.
Why food?
Food is what we have more freedom to choose, and that's what we can decide for ourselves, for our family, every single day, and not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices, each day, are a large part of our daily environmental impact.
We wanted to translate it with an indice, we could talk, for example, about ecological pressure, and it generates much more of what we choose to order to the recording that maybe the way we dress or how we moved to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution.
My word of orders is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing.
I say that almost a word is referring to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our inhortion with food.
To use it means, for example, the way we use sponsorship, the way we decide to acquire, so, for example, the thing of buying the right, what really works, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
You, also, obviously, try to use 100% of the subjects, the thing of consumers, optimize consumers, and above all, the way in which we make theattoos every day, theattoo, so, what are we actually wearing the table?
I went to this project, so, through the encounter with the affection of the lines, of the rejects, of what we often use travels.
Many of you have a small example of scarce towards preliminary grounds.
We are used to doing what I'm doing now, every day at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate them from one part, there is the noble part that we use, and from one side there is the scarce.
The scary, so the less noble part, is in average to less 50 percent.
In winter, we arrive up to 70% because so many vegetables have more protected areas.
What does it mean to optimize in the kitchen?
It's about changing food approach, that's just about regaining the things of waste, meaning having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a joke together.
Let's take an example with mine.
Mela can see it as - okay, it's a window, but I can also see it as - maybe I'm eating it like that with me - or maybe it's convenient and I do a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria - it's probably more - the landscape, the centrifuge, and I'll ferment it as a bunch of four ingredients, for example the chicken, because, in fact, I've done PIP, but it might be quite natural.
This is just an example with a product that should be familiar with, but it's the thing that in my opinion we should apply to every single ingredient.
Another example, one of the ants that led us more time to love, to love 100% entitled: For example, Zucca loves me a lot because busy is the only noble part, it's where most fiber concentrates, and it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit is certain for health.
But not only: with all internal behaviors I can prepare a cell, the seeds can compost them, or simply make them manage.
Let's manage one thing, I think it's a practical example of a very simple technology, that allows us to transform and value something that we all have at home, and that we usually don't doubt a look and let's go.
So optimizing the kitchen for me is mostly this: changing our minds a little bit and seeing with different eyes, particularly the ants, but all food, to spreh them less and appreciate them to massive.
To optimize is to optimize consumers of energy heater.
For example, every time I talk about toothpaste or vegetables, in contemporary water there are other things, maybe there's some vegetables, it's not that good for you.
Sometimes I use an electrodom as a lavatoviglia, but also to cure it, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that some of you are shooting the bear, but it's a very high term basically cup, low temperature.
So it doesn't happen that you use a professional tool for 2,000 euros, but you can simply use the vast covers all the time you wash the pieces.
How do you do it?
A very practical example: take a glass like this one, it must be hermetic, let's place a new one, cover with the water, and close it, and re-read it in the middle of the golden plates, the wave, even must be full of catisports like always, and then open it at the mirror of the jacks and not vice versa.
When it finds, your egg will be to the kitchen, to the sidewalk, to the handwalk you've chosen.
And it will be fantastic because it will be lit at a low temperature, so much better than the classic or the left side, an amazing consistence.
Have you made a zero impact, this zero, and even more, obtaining a result that would hardly obtain with traditional technology.
So optimizing the use of domestic adaptation, I think it can give beneficial interests.
Another application of optimizing this time to the act, I enter even more into your home.
When we were in war, okay, there was plenty of food, we had a small protein, a lot of patates, dust, and really, when they could put the forehead, and it worked well.
Now, the problem is the opposite: we have so much abundance, and we have a little tendency to put everyone in touch the doppy of proteins that are good for us.
Why is it a problem?
It's a problem because, in fact, if we eat trafficks or thumbs, yes, we may put our weight on our feet, but if we put our behavior in proteins, we are actually fighting rivers, featured and increasing the risk of developing some pathology.
Something that doesn't do us right.
The classic portion of the recording, but also that we make ourselves in the roof, that can be from the legs to the wires and fish, in fact it's too much overwhelming, eating so many vegetables, and, in fact, we take a large part of our daily protein loop.
Why did I add this to my talk?
In fact, eating more than what is used is a spreco of resources.
Surely something that can be improved?
If most of these proteins are animal proteins that surely have an elevated environmental impact, that is, even more, if we do it at the global level, in public sphere of health.
The benefit of being the singer is obviously for society.
I think it's more efficient to try to convince you, to put a few fewer proteins in theattoo, that maybe try to convince all of you, to drop the products.
I'll have one, and maybe this thing I want you to get ready, you don't have to worry about eating enough, but not eating too much, that's the problem of proteins, and especially try to eat them as the best way to privilege the animals with a huge environmental impact.
What?
Are you asking?
Well, in other words, in the next year, Apple will also be and there are a lot of people that talk about food of the future, food of the future, I mean many insects.
I also think that I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we're not a comedy of insects, and I believe we'll hardly become it, but that, even more self-productive, we are at home, and that, moreover, we can nourish from vegetables, perhaps not those we can't use.
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about surprise ospites that are with me on the stage today, like lunch, who have a little suffered the first arrangements of the Trentin, as you can see, and they decided on the night to go to the fire.
In any case, I have a representation here.
Why do I like the lights?
Because any of us can self-produce them are a gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
To those of you who have never eaten lumps?
Who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, there was more foodmen than the shop.
Five 35 years ago, a law that prevented us from collecting them. We were also refrigerators of producers and professionals. This promoted a great development of luminous producers in Italy, and we are countries, including the economy at the global level, there are so much to dare, extremely delicate, just to know how to do it.
To bring your window at home, you just need a little pack, a gold, a little bit of land, a queen, to avoid escaping.
The things that actually arrive on their own, it's enough to get rid of the inalated, or you can h uova, and then feed it with vegetables, so there's even more to smoke food patches, and twice in the year you'll have your roots in a spring, like an orchestra.
There's a time of covering around an hour and then you can do what you want, so from Burghignon, the French seats, or richer one of the strangers: do you surely have satisfaction?
It's a meat, among the other tiny fats, that has a lot of benefits, and it can, for me, not only the food of the future, but also the food of the present.
Maybe next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they will never eat them.
Or they created a small change of mentality and surpassion of a prejudice.
So, sustainable revolution.
I'm convinced that it could be the port of any of you and that really riches a small change, surely a change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices, are conscious that makes you want to pick up the coast, eat all the waste, start to start to start to the gate of any of you.
And protect it in theattoo, change the way we see all the ingredients.
The benefits are really many.
And unit of me became revolutionary because benefits really are so many, are for our health, for well-being, and especially for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've brought two data with me: one has a common data with six gangs, one from one to six.
The other one went to ten gangs.
If I launch it, any value from one to ten has the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you launch the data of ten gangs, I'm the one you know.
See this game, you can see the same or largest number of mine.
six to five.
Otherwise, have you become the player?
Comparating with the fact of ten gangs is easier, but you must say approximately what is your probability of coming to this game?
One possible approach is based on the experience.
I'll explain to myself: can I read the data repeatly and take the grades of each life?
After 100 hours, I will realize that coming to the seventh cake or twelve times every play.
A bit of peace starts and a lot of lights, I understood that the Vitoria Province was approached by 75%.
The increase of releases, my stance based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
Later, if you had a super poem to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portal must deliver to release in about 100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo methodo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method.
We can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the evolution of a battery colony of an epidemic, or even the abandonment of successful interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as if we were abused of the brutal force of computer science.
I find it pretty a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
One of the pieces of data.
I don't want to talk about Maths today.
I want to tell you a capital of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, that I was so much streamed, was disappointed for the first week of being dotted.
In terms of work at exceptional levels, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary end of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and unbearable humanity.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
I've worked extremely hard, technical, often frustrating, and it's based on innovative research.
According to the ITAVincent, there are 1010 failed attempts.
The dotor may be a lonely path.
I spend most of my time sitting on a computer or on a statistical article.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
I felt in motion a subject of life in a gang of gold for a mathematician who studied West, but I can guarantee you that at that time my mind was more than we were, paralyzed.
And a few months after the report of the doctorate I started to teach.
That's what you do.
Let's teach math and English.
What's the 40 minutes' time?
I've prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson, if there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I wasn't interested in answering this question.
I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoric state.
And that's how I kicked up to 'soffitto'.
I started to live in lessons and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to be prepared alone. I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, surprise them, and make them happy.
I tried to take advantage of every opportunity.
I got a diploma in didors with university, and I began to teach two hours to the students of the first year to more than eight years old in births of the most advanced things.
Most of them were the job positions, the more I became efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
I have realised in every aspect of learning.
Preparing with the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I really like to correct the compounds.
The authority of the students, rightly wrong if they are, brings a continuous learning.
Then there's the moment of performance.
The rhythm becomes a showman, and the rhythm of each stadium.
It's not my spettacol.
The gratitude of the students repeated entirely my career.
I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, a specific recognition came up.
The University of Warrick asserts me the award for the acceptance of ingnancy, as a young researcher.
The cost of my doctorate had so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
Everything is natural, beautiful to win.
In my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
From that point, I have to go back to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why?
What was the reason for all this euphoria?
Thatocoon, those emergencies of determination.
Well, the answer I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
A concert... Beh, TED, this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
From these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge?
My mind had started moving at the moment in which I had tried to put the lies of my students in motion.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience.
Now I'm writing my doctoral thesis, I'll finish in the next few months.
This is when I decided to take my next step.
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
What are we going to see?
I've told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
Monte Calla part, for example, the fact of undertaking a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or even motivational purposes through strings that weren't expecting.
And then passion as catalizer of our talents and the culture of sharing.
There's the last thing I want to share with you: and to do it, I invite you to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams.
There are more than 100 students in the classroom.
I enter a good eye, I laugh at the caterridge and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
In her face of the time, I scalp my voice.
There's already silence.
I think that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some instructions about women's questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night watching theami of the five years passed, I collected everything they can expect in a model.
And you will be able to have good lessons.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had very little time for this practice, but there's a lot of material online, and there's a place to show it on the rear of the diagram.
I'm satisfied.
Well, let's start the show.
I used to buy the washing machine, but I often came with them to ask how to work.
Each point of practice we find a element of theory that we repeat the matters together.
Anyone was a very difficult question, but I had spent the afternoon on their testo book, they were well prepared, I had it.
I end up with them to let them take the breath: it's a direct, come back!
I'll show you the enemy of the magnifying glass for hell.
A group of students breath, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
And I'm solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
But finally, Pierre finds the courage only to tell me, "I want to thank you only!
But even if you do it for us, you don't do it for anyone.
I only live in class, it's a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe this is exactly my place in this world.
So, this is what I want to tell you: mind and heart are worthy, and that's why, when the mind is in motion, your heart is also strong inside the breast.
They are hearts and movement.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) It's an ufficiently starting November 2rd, Lime Movember, where Momo saper Mastas, Pafy and Vander November.
It's the world's campaign, the lives of men to make the cows grow all over the month, to the point of promoting the dialogue and the recipe for the massive health programs.
On November first, many of them moved more fruit in the bathroom, became flags and its ambulant publicities for them often ignored by the maskile health that we are asking to know how to donate in the future.
In 2003, the Foundation Modemper, swimming in Australia to Melbourne, has brought more than 559 million dollar off, finance research projects against the demonstration in more than 21 countries.
Movander has already become a global movement, so from Rio to Mosca, to Trento, to TEDxRento, we support research, put it on, put a selfie and share it.
Senza Trent, #Movander, asking our love to donate Movender, soon as: "Vive the research, I live in Vander, live in Tedrek Credo."
(Clapping ends) [Nave Giapponese] [Nave Giapponese] [Nave Giapponese?]
One, two, three.
Good afternoon everyone.
Today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my prosthesis about leadership.
In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book, and as it's often like my captain, when I read and when I drink something, it started to make me done by others, it began to listen to different conversations.
As a result, I was talking about change.
He said to her, we must change the house, right?
You have to change your attitude, right?
Everyone can do this.
The change was a crucial theme.
My colleagues did this last year in a very clear way.
What's interesting about the change is that, as the bonds have already said, we all face the change as if it were the most normal thing.
They say that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something.
But in reality, when you approached the change, the first thing you've had was over the fear, I felt that in this change there are many people.
There are many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing?
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, actually, it doesn't know how to use it.
The opportunity seems to be here, right now, from diversity.
How to integrate everything that has given us a different memory?
One day, my daughter Carola and my mom, we had a housewife of gay friends.
Then, at some point, we were on the scene and said, "Dad, but why Alessandro Luigi are two men?
So Carlo, we're really three men.
No, no.
I love two.
And you know with mom.
I guarantee you this: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you never know what to answer a child, especially if you were small.
I said, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly what matters to do something different, and this is a little the difficulty, but because, if on one hand, I want to create a culture of change, on the other, we need to create leaders of change.
I've been working for many years in companies.
Today I take care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
It's not the immediate thing.
The brightest leaders do this too.
Now, every time I start writing this idea, I'm always in the United States, writing in a paper, the word change, acts this word change, I get a thinking that gives me in these words and form an encouragement "accio," which, in reality, is a given.
A affection that, for me, clearly this is a prosthesis of personal entirety, a leader today must have, which means knowing how to stay, must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change.
The cake is an act: it's creative and an agent of change, meaning to creative people of transformation and change.
What's the new element here, for me, at least?
The new element is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change.
MM: Yes, that's me.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the change of prospective change that I thought, but, the idea of taking this leap, to do things, to make things, to make projects, bring people from one place to another, and in this way, there is a transformation that also involves you, also involved me.
It's not that I'm a project, I'm paid on the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and all that I do with what?
To the development of creative thinking, which leads her to move through this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A bit of the ability to dream.
Then this model we've imagined it later through five fundamental pillars.
The first one knew about transformation.
Transformation means everyone is creative in their own way.
Finally, we don't talk about creativity as something related to talented people, to genius, exclusively to artists, or to someone who may be in a markets, rather than communication.
It's not everyone's thing, take action on the environment you live in.
And if this is true, it's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity.
I explained, "Samattina we started with a tunnel, brainstorming, it's one of the roles that allows you to fulfill your creativity.
What do you do with creative thinking?
Because working on divergent thinking and convergent thinking.
This is not enough.
We had to take a leap and make a move, a little bit ...
To begin to involve that which is the emotional part, the lack of emotions.
We heard about emotional intelligence first.
This is, to precisely encourage the absence of sex to your emotions.
Those forces, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel fear.
When I feel that it's not courageous and you have to take the leap, that you don't do it.
but also those.
When you know about your emotions, you can let the judgment and launch yourself in a kind of opportunity.
And what's interesting is that when you do this, it's not that you're indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a positive way.
But you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotion brings you to do this.
We can mention several examples of leader who have made these messages.
Not only did we suffer in Italian countryside, it probably deserves marimets with grams.
But at the same time Chico, who, like the last year, know that has been awarded to another day as the world's company, worldwide immension, for innovation, and has increased by 67%.
This means that winds change towards them, like saying, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you operate.
So the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way of opportunities, we say in management, and create the weather.
But in reality, I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but as well as nourishing, because the veracity today is in supporting the leader to identify that with their behaviors they can generate something that has a particular impact on the inside the organic contexts.
What does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment in which people can fight on ideas.
It can be a free spirit.
It may be, as to say, to relate to one another, but they can also make mistakes.
And this isn't that easy in our organizational environments, because there's always the evaluation of the results as if the results were achieved only in one way.
But on the other hand, dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, it also offers the opportunity to do that, to explore new ways.
And to do this, it's not that easy.
Then, we don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit.
And it's a child to imagine something, and now you do it.
If I asked an adult, there's a competition rate there.
And they say it, or I say it.
The drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, it's better that I don't say it, it's better that I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins.
What's interesting, when we're in this situation, is exactly how do we get to know how to restore creative spirit?
And here, in addition, the impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact that necessarily remains if this is not an organization, also about reinventing the customer relationship.
Because the prosecutive is completely changed.
Then, to return to that original beer.
So, the idea is to be able to make a paradigm, change its paradigm, or what?
To find ourselves in the situation of being aware, of bringing the creative spirit, but of putting ourselves in a deliberate way to say, how can I be curious today?
In what way today, spinning around Trento, looking at the people who are here, can restore my curiosity, my imagination?
How can we look at people find something that isn't so disrupted?
So the sense of attention we saw in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking.
But this clearly imposes the courage of creating physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, the value of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to allow the permission to make things happen inside of you and then out.
So, in a few words, the courage to move away.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
We're about to land, to drop your confidence belts.
How many times will you be captained?
The only time there is the chance to see from the top the most amazing, the most powerful, the most diffused invention of humans: the city.
And it's also the only time I've probably thought about: how is it possible that millions of people, over thousands of years, close to these places to be together, both mass and choose to live not all separated, but together with what we call cities?
But you'll also have an important question to your forehead: But is it positive or negative?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon or limit?
This is a story that goes back in time.
Actually, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
As you can see, maybe there's no money left.
In this city, the biggest process of history began with the most unexpected sentence.
And the process is obviously the process of the city, and these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They thought about Manchester, and they didn't see what now captain you when you were doing your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine: they saw dead streams, without leaves, pobreza, pollution, but not that of today, the true fumig was doing, that carbon particles prevented one with the other.
Obviously, both scribes with the book, which was called the operating class in the cities where the city of all the bad guys in the world were accused.
For the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty, and there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible.
It was like saying a malhealthy suffering, something necessary sometimes, but to contain.
From this, over the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of November, there were also some disciplines to limit this phenomenon Chiara probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
Science accounts, urban farming, which you can see here.
Something tremendous that, maybe, you've ever met, has bizzer tools.
One is called full of service, which is the rock in which when you have to change a mud at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
And then, the planning, the piano, which means the idea that there is someone from the past who can imagine the future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead.
Otherwise and hide.
The zonization that, fortunately, you didn't know all, but that achieves to say is to appeal to imagine a centimeter in the city, what had to happen in the future, in a house, in a trade, in a theater.
And then, let's imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about the city.
It's famous film, a series of movies in the 1980s went from New York, from Los Angeles, where Manhattan became an incontrollable slide, a city full of violence and land, so much to abandon it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It becomes a prison where all the world's challenges are threatened by thealto and scanned forever.
What's interesting about this process is that, like all the processes, this leads to mind a little lung, from 1845, there's a window of years ago, the sentence came.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only by reading the motivations of this sentence, we discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but by the growth of the population, demography, inequality, environmental sustainability, security, economical development, the ability to create knowledge.
In fact, this feeling also fits three, important elements that motivate this ability, which is the city to improve the world.
The first one is density.
See which myallel, my photo from thealto of my city, and the density, meaning that many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can be in the same method, much more this positive effect is verified.
The second is diversity, in other words, that there are not only many things in a small place, but that things are diverse, that there are few ricks, people from all over the world, people call socks other people that also ignore me the most famous sidewalk.
The third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and food, and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Then, here's my idea, that the city as a solution is really a mechanism.
The city definition is no longer the vastness, the people, we are all used to confronting this other city for the people, for the vastness, for the GDP.
That's it.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, and resolves the biggest question of humanity, a great mechanism that transforms, different interests, many individuals that come from stories, regions that have different goals, because if you want to go on a trip together in a car, you'll fight all day long.
Instead, the city has managed to thrive magically as many individual interests in well-being collected.
So the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism.
So it's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we know some cities, also in Italy, also big, that, perhaps in this moment, after a thousand years of history, have tempted this ability temporary.
Maybe some people, maybe you may consider that, right now, or in some periods, they may be this virtual mechanism.
And then we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to move from mechanisms of human containment to mechanisms and tools that develop development.
I'll give you two examples, cutting down the bass of the work I've been doing in the last years, and that they are not afraid of the human phenomenon, but that is trying to feed this mechanism, with utopia and courage.
The first example is Mility, and this is also the trip I've made for years with this map turned to the city, the idea is to name this green, a vital stage, where every day we can travel, at the center of the city, about ten minutes per meter, from the Man, which together is to name, like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 km of green, as I did.
And that, on the way to see the city's maps, we can imagine as an element of diversity of strength, not let us distrugle, believing in the positive things of the system we live in, not allowing us to rebel cement.
I don't know if you all have this in mind.
The second example is that of a city with a few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires, in Argentina, the city, and it's been a quesit a few years ago.
What can we do with this city in 2030?
They all worked out all the adventures: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, it's the perfect magnet of all the nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, has been in some way uncertained.
Rolence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
But, on the end, that of limiting the development.
Instead of courage, shaping up, with the same ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, which are the cities, like the vital park, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
These strategies that develop development, and that you can see qualified a huge density magician, that is, a huge population, a huge infrastructure and the creation of spacious, pedonal or green.
See, this is the density.
Pianorice, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but to increase a billion inhabitants in the city, to replace the inhabitants in more in the city, the population not only of the agency but of the whole world and the creativity to gather.
And then building a system of infrastructure, which allows us to increase more in this development and toelerate them.
As I've mentioned, social spaces, green and pedonal spaces.
And these three strategies together focused on the development of Buenos Aires, to ensure that cities are the solution to all around the world.
So, what's the city, when you think about it again, and maybe choosing the spot on the spotlight, looking at the humanity, will have a different feeling in your heart and you will know how to answer that question you've been asked so many times.
And maybe you'd be proud to live in what I call, the section of cities.
Thank you. (Applause)
The words are important.
My way of reaction was our thinking.
The words of our language are extraordinary.
They're the vocative circumstances, full of emotional stories, they're notebooks, they're evocating, that resonate with our history.
The beauty of beauty is our language, and it's fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceived, and again, I'll talk to you.
I talked about the montant way of the English school: the provincial, emotional, often dark, of English Italian words, which in a few years has started to become common.
But it took a bit longer and I'll start to show you some Latin monks.
Many rats have on their insecutions and the largest universities in the world and show them with great budget.
Here we are in Australia, here we are a cone, and there's a Latin motto.
In Ghana, in the UK, at the Ronda Kins College, and at the Uxford Round, in Corea, Svezia, Chicago, in the United States.
Wald says Veritas in her insurance.
Not just that university, proudly, would say if it's in Latin.
Londra has a Latin motto: Parigi has a Latin motto, Canada, Kintsland in Australia, has a Latin motto.
But not just that.
The American Marina says, "I know I've finished it, you've always heard it in a thousand movies."
The British woman speaks in Latin, and even an institute, there's no money to be a footballer like NASA registers a Latin sign to the Apollo emissions.
Why am I doing it so late with Latin?
With Latin engines.
Because if there's a simple place in the world where a Latin motto could stay, that's it.
Follow.
The rule of Latin.
Instead, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven the launch of the Human municipality?
This is it.
(Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we should say it.
Wow, Millendyu!
Wow, Mendyu?
What is this support of bass reading?
What is this contamination, this quote between two crazy lines that welcomes each of us?
What are the five pallets at the top?
(Laughter) (Applause) And you ask, "But why?
(Laughter) But because at the moment that I take, if we look at all the tourist attacks of all the cities of the world, there's no one who takes the insane thing to settle their name, to land.
It's not a battle.
Not just Doma.
Afterwards, between his feature, we want to dare an alert to the touristic gate, as soon as the Ministry of Benecutre.
I thought it was beautiful.
Done?
(Laughter) No, it's not very beautiful.
Or, look, Beautiful.
We are the English Italian way for all of us.
I don't like us, I don't like nonsense, the curious thing is this.
One, two speaker style, Italy.
Let's talk about an Italian code.
I am talking about the Italian.
The most romantic language in the world opposite to "Roomy and you."
The Ork's shoe.
It's the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents, what I know.
The fourth most studied language in the world.
That they don't study the Italian to do businesses: the studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, fashion, opening, art, history, Dante.
Students for this one.
And that's it.
And this: we're talking about the angels, we're talking about...
What happens?
For example, pizza has conquered the world by calling pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map with the quantity of our same map of negotiations selling to bug or Otdox.
Vincere the pizza.
So, if the whole world eats and says, "Pizza, why do we here in Italy have wine?"
Keat here: we eat food, we drink wai in Luca, there's nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because in New York, if there's a story they must promote in the week of the Italian wine.
Because the Resistors of New York, beautiful and officers, who sell food and wine, say, come!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's give food and listen to fashion.
This is what is written by the Italian River's paper: the Kiddishers, the most "blem," directly by the passports of the Winter.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once, a single woman runs as if it were a mountain street in the Gran Canyon and not folks and the women we see in our windows of birth.
Why?
Forget it.
Hiver Gonia.
There are no hearts.
It's a word of publicity, older, of adopting.
Anyway, this is the publicity payment of a vecture of not in Spain and speaking, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and French talks.
This is the same payment in Italy and it speaks English.
There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) (Laughter) She says, "Let's go to our radicies and we call ourselves "Landini," this, "Uni Only."
Tognose, it's always catitalian.
We're not convinced.
It's curious because over two Italians didn't like an English word.
Because in 2012 we say that they're 58.
We don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and it's seen.
(Laughter) And here we have to wait for the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled from the lady, who has compiled this model of the asylum as an advantage, linguistic competition.
However, every day, for immigration, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are controversial, we use a quantity of English words, not necessary, not deeply inserted in the Italian language, purely accessible and subtle.
We are colors, instead of calling, let's say, the question, instead of place.
I have heard of it: the phenomenon is the location that was chosen by the incotile.
The headline is a location.
We say compilation skills, we say "that" because it's "that ideas."
If the ufficies can feel, we must create a set of lines joining the caste for satisfaction, (Laughter) with united business.
When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennato" to put this gang on the Clinical Serdice.
Because the united business is always like, full and newspaper.
(Applause) According and e-mail talk not only about it in companies, but also in media: government public recording, government.
We have a law from the State called Jobset, and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't solve it much better.
I have forced the newspapers of Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We would have made a house in English that won't be much better than that, because it has an English name.
Well, a couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea, I was in detail that I had to do something.
Communication of my degree, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective, I thought, with the kids of my work, to put a start on a network to make sensibilization and activism about this problem.
Freek is without spending a sunny.
We are simply putting a bit of competence, communication and waste, and a little bit of energy.
This application that invites amministration publics, the government, the companies, in average, to say it in Italian, and was reviewed in the first hall in the Academy of Cusca, because it was a part of this awareness company.
We were expecting an extra discourse, but not what happened.
In a month they signed, putting a name, a cup, a signal, and there are 70,000 people.
They filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spike that the engineer has signed up split professionals and called pensioners, they signed Italian people in the west saying, "What does our language do?"
Patients are filled with intensity.
The filmed from all over the world, from Singapore, from Jedusalem, from the coast, from South Africa, Canada, Canada.
It's one thing with a movement: I had passed, smell, to look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
"You'll come from someone."
Italian is a right, but also a doer.
We are in nine steps.
If we think consciously, we'll talk more equally.
Is the work in a public record?
It's like that.
But because I studied classic studies, "No, I have to work with economists."
The love in fashion: I've received a ready to laugh, it's not for the individual of three.
I don't think there's been.
(Laughter) A good Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English.
"Sicha."
And we know how we rhythm speaking.
This is one of the most stretched: I have a new slam, but italian parlian, it says, "Tchung, go Rome food."
So it starts to let me decrease our language.
Because you can't say, "Stey day, it was a squirrel wedding wedding, OK?"
(Laughter) (Applause) In Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, in Paese, in Vengardy, in Katta, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say that bubbles are tables, but they llen the basket of camps, but you do, and so on.
I say because I don't believe those who say "cool" or "cool".
We fill because I've heard of it, an university is that they say displegated, instead, that they visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
(Laughter) (Applause) I want to understand what politicians say to my vote say.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, it's 85 years old.
Thank you for a motorcycle.
Well, as we said, an extraordinary ecosystem transversing because in mass communication, they established this thing of cost $0 on the Internet and its widely amplified.
And this initiative is used in more than 100 plantations on the Italian journals, with a transversal consensus and imaginable.
They talked to them together, grammares and will be on the bass of the dispublic, but the gathering with great applause, also in the area of art and selling it.
He spoke to me Wired, and Vaniti Fer, talked about the Christian family, he spoke to me about the Daughter of Turing, he spoke here today that behind him made a publishing company.
A potential that is developed all the social status, a little here and a little here, and that go deeply from spotted more diches and to the most populated ones.
The species are a great wish of riachory with knowledge and consciousness of our language.
This thing was ending in the newspapers, it also touched me, putting myself on top, on the windows ... I started talking.
This translipense at the age, I was intelligent from an Australian and Australian employee.
Well, we need this.
And all this is something that comes from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we call at every moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the hell is we're all stretched, it's it.
I remember some reasons to do it.
Afterwards, the Indian aid to make us understand and it's a fact of dismaking, because it makes us understand a fact of dismaking.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
We need to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
We have to sell the agend, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
Keeping crazy, we turn each lobby, it's beautiful, also protects the brain, knowing more than a language.
But those who know the mad people use them one by the way.
In Tanglesi, on top of that, we saw it and easy to straighten it, so the one who talks about how it manages, spoke better.
And then Leonardo was mentioned, in the first of the talks of this journal, Leonardo who defined himself "Homo Sanza Littere," because he wrote the flight, in Italian.
It was always the structure, the way to decline the Italian language, helps us express our creativity.
If we resign to express our language, we resign to express one of the pecuriarities of the magnificent potentiality of our most Italian creativity, which is the words in your mapping language.
It's even if our linguistic status is strong and often we can approach some strange words, why not charity?
We have to clarify it inside a box which is not fulfilling and associated with losing sense of what is needed to an excess, a finalist, or to evil.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us the Italians, with our identity, our roots, our history, our openness to the world, that goes from our words.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is all about that person, about their needs.
But if that person, even with something that doesn't happen, is your mom, or your grandma, what happens?
What happens to you if mom or dad or her parents start to feel bad if a child or a teenager still is a kid?
When I was a teenager, I didn't have the worst idea of being a young woman.
As everyone went to school, I picked up and sat down with my friends.
But what's behind these photos that you can't see?
First of all, I would like to take a step back to you, to always start from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed and what is the same. Perhaps some of my age would say that I still love ducks and changed hair.
But what is the invisible in which picture?
What has led me from my mother, which you can see at the center, to my adulthood, who's currently going through my teenager who's seeing lines?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family.
They are tsunanic that grew up gradually until they brought it back.
A tsunami is called health problem.
And when one of them hides, through their parents, and you still have a child, the teenager, they are your reference points, they become really complicated.
What if I tell you that the health problem is a mental health problem?
And also the need to take care of domestic gangs, like sponsorships, or to see fans, are lines smaller, or to talk to the doctors and to manage therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But, along with this, we could manage the voices and the emergencies, for which no one has prepared you.
How to manage the situation when your father or your mother saw many things that psychologists don't exist.
Or to have to do with standing up in depressive manipulations, without anybody having prepared to do it.
Or even witnessed, seventional careers, suicide attacks.
But in addition to all this, we also had to keep going all the time, going to school, studying, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another character, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or Tobabana, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, it's hard for somebody to think it will be for that or will remind you of parents' problems or deeper people.
Efficiently someone will consider you as a genetically committed and destined to automatic is to edit the same discourse.
If you try to say that your mom or your grandmother have a shepherd disorder, a disorder bipolish a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, Mom, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health and mental health don't give the same dignity and respect.
Today, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us.
And this brings a way to understand what is happening inside you to your own affection, a way to ask and receive sometimes not to receive a cure.
And for you who are a child, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that you perceive around you is the difficulty of communicating inside you, and then family, stigma, prejudice, envyment can lead you to having everything inside and not say exactly.
But loneliness, in silence, I'm a heavy musician to bring, for a wormer.
How did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible?
I bet on that smile.
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rage, and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans, but that made me grow before the others.
At the same time there was also a result of help, a result of help that couldn't be able to pull, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade began to learn in that negotiation.
When, for the first time, the light began to filter.
I still remember the psychologist of the family consulte who was the first person outside the family, with whom I had the chance to open myself and who helped me, piano, to see people sitting around me the feeling of being supported.
The truth and the "Stop A" was for me to have read on the Internet about forms, stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that had brought me to the travelers.
Stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all unites.
But there's something that has helped me and that we have in common.
And that we're often convinced of being the only one.
But it's statistically impossible.
In the world we are millions of people.
However, we invited us to try it, to be there no one else, to have lived the same things that we lived with us.
And do you know why it happens?
We don't talk about our children's stories.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've tried and understand that were natural the reactions I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics that were born precisely to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent side by myself, I went to see in Canada, for the first conference I spoke about, to meet these children, to talk to them.
And it was a moment of positive or powerful spectrum, because their view, the story I had experienced, but also the feeling of writing.
They're seen, the pain, but also the ability to absorb, to transform the pain together for a change.
I've seen those positive characteristics of resilience, empathy, courage, willing to change the school state that I didn't recognize in me, but that by seeing reflection in them, I finally felt my own.
The counter has been an owner, an enormous owner, and it still gives me energy.
And it's an owner that I strongly wanted to bring in Italy, in Europe, to help other conveiled forgots, other children forgotten, to be able to take pictures of their homes.
The wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel just when one, in the ambigence, begins to suffer from a psychic disorder.
It's an immense desire that needs access to everyone, because other measures, as I can't even feel before caricating the weight of the world all on my shoulders.
That's how we get to this day.
In 2017 along with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we created the first Italian association, created by children for other children, to give voice to adolescent children who don't have a voice, to change our instances, even the institutions, and it's called "comit, pactle, 90 percent, children, parents with mental disorder."
We gave the trip to a project that's called, the mini guide I've written, and that I'd like to have my hands when I was 15 years old, it's called, "When mom or dad, something that doesn't work, helped me survival for children of parents with mental disorder."
And it's a project that has started underground, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room now, who have grown in this same desire, gave us the opportunity to start and do something else.
This project has an annual way of giving a family of this mini guide to all the school and citizens, all the consultants and sedentary scientists, because no young man left alone, neither the families.
Especially children of parents who are not aware of their disorder and don't even be cured for their disorder.
We also have to think about these kids.
I was one of them for a while.
At first, when I thought about this project, I had details: I will never make it realistic, how will it do?
But on the piano, I asked to help people around me, also to the scursionists' guides, proposing to tell them during a trip in ten minutes the story, and to find these people in the civil society who may not have experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in the change, and bring a family of the need in our own owner, to the community library.
And now we are able to get to so many regions, from the right beach, until Sicily, to the Sardegna.
Let's close, we want to reach them all.
Another wish we have is that, I mean, to support the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
The other huge desire we're realizing is to meet schools, talk to the students, to the kids.
Not only Fliggger Giver, but everyone.
To be able to have a mark of atoms, to face those that are positive and negative emotions, the life's face, leaving markets, before they're too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path, the one we have in front of us, but if there's one thing I know, it's the will to change the scope.
And that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, even thanks to you.
If this story had collected you, motivated you, talk to them, story about your friends, your colleagues.
Together, let's take the door that wasn't open for us.
Let's get the light in.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I want to talk about a special person: Aaron Sfarz.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I will surely play a hacker in a sense of smooth and a intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Around 14 years ago, they were in the group to share the rest.
Maybe you don't say much about it, but it was ugly in the frame until ten years ago.
It built 15 years to be creative. We were responsible for the technical part.
Creative Commons are around a building of contents.
Labor licences make the most flexible and open copyright.
I am, for example, Wikipedia license.
About 20 years old, you become a small start-up.
It builds something to reflect something called reddit.
Ten billionaire from one day to another.
Honestly, they didn't take so much money.
It continues to do what has always made us build an open and collaborative Internet.
It works with the Internet archaive and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving Tabyte and internet tables, internet cameras, and it's going to be bidden, they are archives of digital memory.
According to Soppa, one of the protagonists of the fight against Soppa, a high school law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do scioper, to go to play, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
What in Aaron absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic anderocious, curiosity.
To love what he himself said in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years old.
Every knowledge: from economy to political theory, to the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
I tell her mother that, at some point, she was spinning and an aircraft had two and a half years and passed in the segelone and watched her over the fridge that she had just attacked with the score in the mind.
But it scored an important thing.
It's about knowledge to a mirror, to his partner, which is the knowledge, and it's the opportunity to share knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creative Commons are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
It's a power movement that we just need to think of a second, we've got anywhere.
Schools in libraries, universities.
Power information said it from Mility, it also said it in the Montessori.
To access to information to people means to make a democratic act.
Democracy is based literally on giving access to education learning.
Without this, there is no disappointment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
The fact that Aron came to this genius which he is, came from his cultural background, which is the one from the Aker.
Maker like any other, not as a writer.
When you know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do whatever you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reading the world a better place requires access to this information.
So, if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so, fundamentally, they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this by yourself.
We start the world thinking, open access, we can all agree with it.
To understand the world a little better, it doesn't become a singer of eroticism, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in what is called Open Hazes.
A great movement for open access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature, maybe there are some university in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
There are many great editorials with the keys of power making scares what scares isn't, that is, scientific information.
And Aaron is passionate about this, scratch this thing called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
I had been curious about it.
A hacker of this genius is probably not seen.
He understands that his opportunity to give Aaron an example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
Of course, it's already made of a veracity and its technical persecution, for having scared hundreds of thousands of articoles from access to academic aircraft and could do it, but not in this scale.
These are answered actors of computer pyramid.
About 35 years old.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first to the rest, anon stops at home, in New York.
She was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, because power information is power.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassaii.
All of the almost different, purely similar.
We wanted to give access to information, regarding the controversial.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last time aron-sfarze intervention, a few months before dying.
(Video) (English) We can do something with you today.
I felt New York!
But no title, now they come.
Now, a person has seen a prosecutive project: the requirements are written, Scradle Sfreddem, but DNA must be sustainable.
It was a channy of calcium for land carcking, in Spain, in calcium, as it serves.
You have to try something, OK?
The line goes well, in Bolfracaba and nieves tables, and it was in Shen.
So we're going to an overwhelming plant.
This is the COMONES mix of an embber, and not a pauscule.
And Switzerland has been imposed on me, it's simply when I like it, Rondice, here's something basic and essential.
There are two internet prospectives: the Internet is open, it's a mass spionage platform.
I've used to spy, to control, to oppress.
And there is another prospective: fantastic, free internet, a full space, freedom of expression.
In reality, these things are the same, they are the two, they are things that coexist in the same way.
I can be just one thing.
Another one says something important: Zaptuas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
I wanted to finish not to share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
Secondly, there's attention and learning, it's still: try and know how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, it's not hell, and make you sleep and give you space.
(Applause)
Good afternoon everyone.
In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading area of the lab of Losalamo, I improved the eyes of theattoo and asked where all of them are.
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was a big deal.
No, it had made a reason.
In our galaxy there are hundreds of thousands of stars.
Most of them are the oldest of our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has 4 billion and a half years.
Then, if life appeared in another planet around one of these very ancient stars, so much first that on Earth could appear in the smartest species incredibly larger than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view.
You might have already traveled betweentelle.
But we have never been spotted in any of these intelligent civilities hypothesis.
And here's the question of closing, I mean, where are all how many?
It's something that can create some curiosity, that can disrupt.
And, effectively, over the years, many appropriately to answer this question.
This has been offered many possibilities for many fantastic answers, but the simplest one is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible.
I think this is a question that we've made all of us, first or later, in our lives.
I, at least, do it all the time.
When I was a child, I watched a rolling sky, I asked myself if, around those bright lights, they could be planets of planets, about those living beings, who, maybe in that moment, were staying in my direction, and they were asking the same question I was facing anchemy.
Now I'm an astrophysis.
I would like to find a scientific answer to this question: Are we alone in the universe?
And I truly believe that finding evidence that life outside the Earth would be an environmental change for our species, for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe.
There's no one at the center of the universe, because there's no center in the universe.
A seventh and a half ago, Charles Darwin explained that our species has been learned with all other GDPs.
Actually, we all expanded from a common antenna.
And, as I believe, finding the scientific evidence of the existence of other worlds inhabitants, I think it would be a third big paragonable revolution, perhaps even better than the other two, for the cover.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps moving forward in the management of a possible answer.
We don't have an answer now, but we are the first human beings to have scientific evidence that there are planets around other stars.
This is one of the biggest news in astrophysics, in the last 20 years.
In many years, 20 years ago, we would be able to suspect it, that there were other planets, that's it, but now we have proves.
We have thousands of planets around other stars, and we already hypothesize that very likely, each bottle of our galaxy has at least one planet.
So we're talking about gigantic numbers, hundreds of billions of planets out there.
And from the penets we know, in reality, we also know that many of them are at the giant distance of their shelves to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so that of sea and oceans on their surface.
And this is one of the requirements that we think is essential for life, as we know it.
Also, according to some statistics, we could see in our galaxy 11 billion pianets potentially adapted to life.
Right or potentially because we are truly moving the first steps, so we still don't have a definitive evidence that one of these planets is, effectively, open.
But we have tools that are studying them, we'll study them, and in the next few years, from the light til that comes from these distant worlds, from us to understand many of the tips that could say that, effectively, one of the elements that are made of this atmosphere could be open.
I hope that all of us can be witnesses at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because I do well, I really believe that it would be an epocal change for all of us.
One of the questions we could ask is that often, in fact, it's from the fact that we will reach these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare wings, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us from an ocean of fold space, the universe really is very big.
So I'll give you an example, a specific example.
That probe, my friends, Geruna.
It's the spaceship built by the man who moved more from the Earth, and traveling for a quarantine of years has reached the stars of the solar system, and has entered the space to testify, and it's setting away from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km from now, 17 km in the second.
So it's a huge speed.
But, I mean, how much would this space probe put to reach the closest to our headquarters, next Centauri, if they were traveling in that direction?
Let's put 74,000 years old, which is a longer time than any human civil society has existed on our planet.
Can we do better?
Yes, we could do that with me.
But the light that travels fast speed is used in nature for more than four years to make this path and the other stars are incredibly farther.
So just as communicating radio with other systems would cost hundreds or thousands of years from the invention of intersegnation, the reession of an answer.
So everything is very complicated.
Maybe we are not alone in the universe, but we are surely like isolated, we are living in a sea of space.
And then, according to me, here's one of the things to be present when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of ferment, and then the interrogative, actually, that we all have, or where are all the many.
And the fact that being present is the subject.
So we're talking about time.
Here's an example of the writer John McFly.
The distance between the tip of my hand master's hand and the tip of my hand at hand is the transcending time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, four billion in the middle of years.
Very good.
The first forms of life, the cellular units, the antennas, which, in all forms of life, never appeared on our planet, even we ourselves, these reacts are enough upright, are somewhere in the palm of the sinister hand.
After a long time, these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate themselves thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here, at the dust of the hand, there is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, animals, plants.
The dinosaurs appear here, at the end of the palm of the left hand, and at the beginning of the last failing, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely to have the impact of a great asteroid, the space inside the Earth, among three quarters of the living species at that moment on the planet.
And the statements of these small, big, have been there many times throughout this long history of life on Earth.
It even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet have been stressed.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, it was a long, difficult, accidentated path, governed by unbelievable events, and that so I didn't have to necessarily bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, I didn't have to necessarily bring to the origin of intelligence.
And it would never have to bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species.
That's what we, in all this, where are we?
Well, the whole history of humanity is at the end of unghia.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the keys of all this.
If one day, as I wish, we found out that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it's going to be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrials could be simple batteries.
The seed may be dominated by microbes.
intelligent species could be rare, and even their existence can be very, incurable, compared to the times of life, to the times of the universe.
Surely, these are the same intelligent species, but sometimes it has developed a certain level of technological progress and internal authentic progress.
Or they simply influence the audience, they spark, without leaving any track on the use.
Maybe this great cosmic silence that will disappear and makes us unfortunate, maybe a little bit of a kind of aviation, maybe we are saying something.
Life had to overcome a large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us in the future.
After all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine us coming from another planet.
If we think of them, probably in the universe, no one would ever realize that we were.
We are a very young species.
As soon as a century we started to fly, to communicate, they will do it.
Or from a fifty years, let's place in space.
In space we arrived at the confines of the Solar System, but we had truly just launched the footprint in this big ocean of what surrounds us.
I think we're going to stand here, really, be a bit like this.
As differences of dinosaurs, we have, at least in part, the chance to change, to influence our destination.
We certainly have the capacity of autonomy.
But we also have as I believe, and I hope to help scientific knowledge and technology to confront and overcome the problems we need in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover technology, perhaps in a future that is quite limited, perfect, to reach other stations.
And then, if there are super galactical intelligences, as you can see in fantasy films, then the only expectation to be part of the key of these galaxic intelligences is to survive as long as possible, we are harder.
If then, we were alone in all this space, then I believe that more and more we have the courage to keep access until we reach this wonderful frame of consciousness, parity, for example, in a small planet, lost in the midst of the cosmos.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport of victory, not from the sport of those who came first, classifies, but from the fact that sports creates positivity and positive things for others.
A sport that may be, and which will grow up, will give us strength to move forward, strength to think.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run I like to run.
And here I was in Namibia, during the first cover of a great trip, a trip made of 104 Chileans that later became 100 centuries, agreed two, because 154 were too few.
No, I've already added two, because you're an important number and you know it's a number that will come back for a long time, this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 km with all the participants, that instead of running, instead of being worried about the arrival of the first, we came together after the 100 Chilean agonies.
The journey is the difficulties already started for the first days.
We are terrified in Windock, high inside the map, and after six hours of traveling, it's enough difficult, we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
A beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics that I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, pettorane.
The printer that has shown me is the number one yet: I know this is an important number for me.
This is the first cover, the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 kilometers all of us, we do them during our performance, but in the desert is the in general, and the rope is a bit like the metaphor of life.
And even in the crop, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, if it's time to do something beautiful, you have to move forward and know how to react.
There's always the chance to react.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
And you see things that say, "Ma'am, G√©rard, you're a bald ..." (Laughter) Okay.
I'm screwing.
For example, I couldn't mold Risinga, an important initiative to pick up basic income for the fight against Roblastom.
But neuroplastics is a infant tumour that unfortunately affects so many children.
Before this experience, I didn't know much about the existence, but unfortunately, there are many many many, that are still in this moment badly, so my goal was to make these 100 kilometres and save sources to give hope to these children.
And when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert because there's wisdom, warm, very calm.
In Namib's desert there are other stages, it runs with 61 grades.
It's true that running at 61 grades is not like running at 61 grades with the right level of unity we have, but there are always 61 grades, right?
During the long run marathon of 42 kilometers, which was lasted as it was about 7 hours of laughter, I had different problems: brains, feature, scoring.
And it didn't do that.
Why?
Because we had to move forward to our garbage.
When it's correct, or nearly?
This was the beginning of the second cover, that slightly late, turned into a kilometer, so nothing dramatic, but it was a beautiful cover, a cover that started to steal even the seventh of the ground, the heat that was in a desert.
The province desert has taught me so much.
She has taught me that we very often, to be, we also feel during all our journeys, during all our workplaces.
We feel unbearable, we feel powerful, but unfortunately in the desert it shows us that you are a punch, maybe where you walk around you and I travel around 15, 20 km where there was nothing, you realize how small we are.
And it also teaches you that beautiful things of life are not just cellulating or driving in the last fashion.
Many kids, to be happy, have to have the cellulare, the last death.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at a certain point in the desert, one afternoon in the desert, one night he could eat and stood up, screaming from the lemon, he stops it, and takes a store from a square.
There's the door, this warm, and says, "You've been announced, don't use this warning, and this folk was a warning warning."
He was happy, because with salary, I don't know if you know it, enjoy it, and I don't know if you know that with salt I can eat.
And I don't know if you know, but what is the result of doing medicine as well?
He was happy for his abuse.
Now we don't have to be happy, probably only for warning, it's good to be happy with many other things, but it's also important sometimes to valuate how fortunate we are.
Namibia desert is the desert that I chose, why?
Because inside the Nanamai Pesiste desert is the highest tail in the world, more than 300 meters long.
And when you know there, we have it made of strings or almost of string, you can see it there on the tip of the gang, and then it scavenged on the other side, it's as if you touch the sky, right?
Because in the desert there is no bare, and so when you're out there, it's an incredible thing.
To be out of the Duna is not easy, and I ran little, I was walking a lot.
And when I arrived at Duna point, I was already in Chile, there were only six Chileans.
We are already the Chilean, which also corresponds to the dome of the world here in Namibia, and I created it.
Abbasson, scusible.
[Inglese] [Inglese]: Fourth Chileometers to make the tridouette windows.
- But for you it's going well, I'm happy.
(Laughter) Thank you all that you are in force.
This is my goal.
(Laughter)
Go!
FdB: As a matter of fact, I wasn't.
Good evening everyone.
And me, in the desert, I also found a quote this morning, if I talked about the small principle of my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, there were more than 26 people, because it was a very happy gana.
There were 96 people who were running with me, in the end, the last two kilometers could also not do them, because the challenge was 104 had a long time, and at the end, a magic, an amazing magic.
MM: As you can see, they were all very humble, but the part was a bit rigid.
So, these are us because the organization that did one else do?
The miles away from the airlock had given that silly to give me the chance to get there, to finish the ufficious lady, you can go back and do the other Chilean in order to return back, to reach 1006.
Why?
Because the project had the goal, which is, to reach these childs' bells, it's really in the inside, the number you, a number you, seem important and recurrent number.
The interesting thing is that we arrived at the end, and the selection came to the end and achieved its goal, on December 20th, 2016 that, if you take the numbers, are exactly the numbers that make 86 km, or 116 for two, 200 officers, but I wasn't like that, I wasn't like that, so I don't worry, you can also run away.
I was like that, maybe a little more, I had 40 kilos more, I wasn't too sportsman, I smoked, when I had other captaines, people reflected, and I probably had 100 meters away, I was already tired.
I wasn't alone.
Sorry.
(Applause) Obviously, besides having a wife that is enough, a little older, Riccardo, already is 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years difference, this is the first day of school.
It's Riccardo, you have to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first element, so big.
I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his own and Pietro Panangeggi√π, obviously he had understood that it's the situation, but, unfortunately, life, sometimes, gave us the hard things, in the end, the factory, sometimes, had been said before, it's a bit like the race, the feeling of knowing how to react.
And that's what happened.
This is celebrating hemorrhage.
This is the picture of a brain hemorrhage.
Unfortunately, Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this cerebral hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malform that we didn't know during birth.
And it has endured hardly.
This is the last time I see it smiling.
When it seemed that everything was going well, on February 18th, 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack, because it was too tight.
So the garage is called Ranna 100%.
And the number is successful, you've understood, right?
Clearly, you don't have to let go, but I don't want to give you a terrible impression, and the 29th of July arrived at San Pietro, but you have to keep (Applause) Continuing to dare the strength that is limited, because you remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed, so there are them.
We had to be positive, and anchoring couldn't beat me.
So I had absolutely had to do what?
Keeping to create or improve my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say this visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give strength to people.
And to be me, stronger.
So I started running the first image you see on the grain is my first marathon mix, inside the Reina de Mil√°n, and then another DNA, a year after the first marathon, the Reina de Very, a very beautiful one.
And until we get to this garage.
I ended up arriving, as I said, to the Namibia desert, where these 16 kilometers have led me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they still need it.
And you can see the little lady, that symbol I've done it with adds, and it's: I'm me and I'm Pietro, and that's why I wanted to take 21222 per two, because I haven't run only inside the desert, and I'll continue to run only.
This year in November, in the Omann desert and Chileans will be 165, so here, there are many combinations.
165 km completely in self-sufficience, so they'll just give me the water, we can see from reaching the end.
The desert is diverse, but the objective is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them do better.
The message that I'm here today is an important message: whatever the difficulties we can have, big or pictures, there's always a hope for everyone, to do a lot of things and to move forward, because life is a little like a bottle, right?
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Andaltice, right?
Here we are, and today it's 17th of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret them.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
