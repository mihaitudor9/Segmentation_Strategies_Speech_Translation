In 2016, I was given a reward, from the out of a blind√ºlery force, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they are born at the ICIRO, let's imagine that this is a great university class.
He usually enters the classroom.
The first ten minutes, when the students come and are, focused on the ego of my computer speaker and put in classical music: I think this is the first step to create environments of less diverse and more resilient data, and try to keep the attention of the students.
But unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a methodology that was used just by old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to transmit knowledge to the students, artificial intelligence.
And like all the stories I tell in children, I'd like to start my story with one time.
It's a second world war.
1942, Unite painting: Belce and Park.
A residence northern Londra.
And there was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
In Laurea there's Kins College de Cambridge and it's a research dot in logic the Princeton Unit in America.
At that time, the guys used a special and enigma machine.
It was commonly a machine to write: the worker digitized tastes, but, older than stealing on paper corrects those letters, I think you'll stamp out other letters, according to a method that was imposed on mechanically under the car.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Whoever interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense: he was criticized.
Alan Turing was one of the main characters "Alessie Park," the one you can see behind, in order to decipher these trees written by youredes.
For this invention you think that the war is over with two years old, saving many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
(Laughter)
So, with his Turing's machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had been created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article on the minds magazine: computer and machine learning.
[Pubblico: Does anyone propose testing?
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
(Laughter) Suppose a person here, directing a computer tower, who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a "o" operator.
In an alternate way, the vehicle M and the speaker give answers to the person P.
It is said that the vehicle starts to overcome that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers came from the vehicle and when the answers came from the operator: this is a game limiting.
Being, the vehicle must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language, the question that comes from the person, must represent the knowledge to formulate the answers, to react automatically to form these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence, one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts at the moment they get, or we try to modify our thoughts at a psychological level.
That's why it says that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues, according to this approach, the assignment that if we can have a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking: probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates is dead.
This is a deductive argument.
From these two premature premises, it is due to a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the understanding of the logic of the thought, from here the logic of dots and transferred to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
An rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) Do you have to act?
But they must adapt to the answer.
You have to set goals and know how to bring them to the end, and you must act in a rational way.
So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, incorporating Turing's quote, can a machine think, we can say we can create a machine.
A artificial agent, capable of thinking, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
Through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, like psychological construction, once we have a great knowledge.
This is what is trying to build artificial and intelligent and supported by humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see today if machines think: I would like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence a little bit, and I would like to use five classics to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We subtomanian, human rights, human rights, superhumans, for example agents that work better than all men and can't do better, for example agents that resolve Rubik's cube already with a fourth in the best way, already with a sad one, think that a year ago a young man has remained in 4.73 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
That works better than all people, for example, in the game of the scats, in the game of the scanning, a few years ago, the facial trunk, wasted by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, those who act almost like all people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answer the questions of the physician.
We looked at the "min".
In the end, we have subtle people who benefit from all the people, for example, in cognitive activities such as cultural words, or the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today can't do, for example, it's a disambition: we're talking about the fridge like mine, or we're talking about the Mark of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty.
And these are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence in which we think we're far from surpassing the test.
Then, let's see in the future.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line that indicates artificial intelligence ascending.
According to Ray Kurzweil in 2010, we had to be able to use this computerlessity, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, which is raddoppy years and in quadruplication every four years, I didn't see anything: in 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar to this computer capacity.
In 2025, according to racial and racial hours, we could already be able to operate in a precise way our brain, and finally in 2029.
And the machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045, and theind is the moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
In its article, published in mind magazines, Turing not only proposes her test, but also proposes new observations against artificial intelligence.
Any year ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, I followed a course of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, taken by professor Gaitano in Lanzerone Lanzerone, a graduated resolution with mathematics.
The label is stupidity, it's the desire to write in simple termines, let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the combination, symbol of a sound on the side of the evolution, but, somehow, the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it is also true that we left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
And reluctantly to the first question, machines can think.
I'd like to share with you an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) How many of you today have spoken about photos?
Craziness.
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confront, with a photograpy, with the basis occupying photography, in Parigi, in the AIM sector, one of the greatest attempts in the new market, for its designal use and sharing images through cell phone call, but that didn't make sure of me a photographer, to find answers.
And that's how we are, but then there are photographs, like Cristo Fotography in Cidental, who came from the sociologist "Nata in Urgenson," a new code that is composed, but, as it has sustained the photography, which is the chance of an enemy of photographies, which is directly, as the fact, as the fact, as the fact, for photography, as the fact of photography, as the factory of Fotography, of Fotography, of Fotographies, of Fotography, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Fotography, of Fotography, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Spanish, of Spanish, of
It was contemporary ... Bread Mengin, who used it for Sport photography, who did a trick of report, giving back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, who made a photographer in the background that has strengthened us, in photographs, in my western land, that has enjoyed the meetings and in its innovative way, that has registered us, that has made a business plan, that has made a photographer, that has made a photographer, that has made a photographer, that has made a photographer, that has made it, in a trigger, of fells, of fells, of fells, of fells, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fillars, of fill, of fillars, of fill, of fill, of fill, of fill,
And do you feel it?
And do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silenced, in fact, there are 50 meters of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered underdolly in our lives, waking up from the illusion that silence exists.
To me, that doesn't exist: so, in this room, those sectors, these seeds, and add a frequency of 50 ARS, then you imagine you don't, you go home after a really stressful job magazine.
And instead of not, eating your partner with your partner, and then you will get to bed in your bedroom and think of being alone, this frequency of 50 Hert, that I simply increased volume, that is, always the women, in our houses, in our lives, but more or less this sound.
Now.
But we have a positive side: Or better still, I leave first from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We are never alone, in other words, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us: beautiful, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50 acts isn't more than a soundonda, a soundonda with a beautiful reward mirror, with which you can make music, and then I was overwhelmed, "But why do you do that, why not make music?"
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents divorced when I was little, and I know it, you think that this is the classic strappalacous story, but no, it was the revelation of my life of those days on the roof of that house, I started to make music with everything around you, with great joy between my mom's and the other side of my mom, that every roof was not playing between streaming, and this is a big thing.
Great!
Of course, I said to a certain point: I tried to become a normal person, trying to say, "I did it because I started studying chitarra, pianoforts," and then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to stop the Clarinetto, the problem Arenzo Arbore really liked, who wrote a beautiful song, both ambiguous and ambiguous, coming to the first years of study in genius.
I also dropped the limb, right, so I didn't go.
My failures, my classmates.
But I dropped all this, because I studied and studied that rigorous notion, because there's more speters in a rumor, and I like to complain it to the problems of life?
The end of my childhood is that of transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
Ciaattoos.
I hope to say, to make a great turn to do it, toys, and everything would be conclusions, but no, I've been complicated this way of life.
But most of all, that's the sound, our inner eye, the catalogue of ossicans, our tax, reaches the maximum functional around the fifth week of gestation.
So the future mother I lend you and it's a react that I personally pay attention to the musical choice, attention to the entertainment, and this is not a case: she must be ready, so not in case, if mom, during pregnancy, listened to Panco British, there's no way to be stupid if the child, once they're born, will end up listening for example Sex Pistols.
But the sound is everything that we are surrounded by, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what in our lives is completely related, and the visitor is much easier: we know it: the visive is when we enter the sound colony of our journeys, the rituals with our partner, the mother who dears us, because mom still grades us, and all this is the sound colony of every magazine.
It's smaller than how you imagine them.
But more small than that: there is a smallest of the Militarian man, the smallest of San Pietro, the smallest of your house, maybe?
It takes the same thing as when someone saw me in video, I watched the stage, and then I came across many people and said to me, "But I imagined higher, right, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible, so, starting from this budget, the visitor?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the goal, is what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to revolutionize your ability to observe. So we're in vaccine, we're in vaccine, get mistreated, not in case, and we start taking pictures of the feet, in the wisdom, then the elephant, Chileans are not, and I've lost the tale, but it's multicanal, multimultural, very, very proud, who had a certain point, who was there.
We photograph it, no one sees the sleep, we keep it, we listen to it, we have a lot of video, but we never stop listening to it.
We never stop listening, anyway, and I show you something: when you read with someone the best moment to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, I would like to bring you with me.
Returning to the world, hoping your perception of listening, here's the decision to choose a dream of my life, the dream of my life, born from the adoption of myself, for the first time I chose myself, and I'd like to share with you the dream of my life.
And the whole part, really, from the flow of cities, the cities are a great musical tool, in order to welcome this musical instrument, decided to participate in a competition, to become an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, in the simple fact that for the first time I was listening, in this moment, and I created a sound colony of each city, named this project of Sound Obs, and, in fact, there was Atlant.
I want to swallow you, Shanghai.
I'm a young man, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl.
(Video) (English) Although people live in Bangladesh, they live in Bangladesh.
I've bought the baby monkey!
Invisible, that's not the case.
Wow!
Good afternoon.
Mamm!
(Laughter)
Alla.
Bye, bye.
Thank you all!
Thank you very much.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test, it wasn't true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, it was all exposed to the visitor.
Now, there's a city that is certain, you've been photographed all the way, and you're more than once, but at that smoke, which goes down to the tombs, which has been built, but the bridge of Brooklyn can completely resonate in the leg.
And you want to get over and over there.
I believe in the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world, and maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
In this photo, in this photo, I knew Genova, he knew Genova, because it's captured so many times, it's been captively captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that among my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll tell you.
Good afternoon.
I started to record the first sounds and the first sons gave me the data of these children, that in this iron pipe, a portable pipe, they gave me this helpful camp, and I make you feel first of the Greek camp, and then elaborated it.
Five, I'm gold.
Let's go to the span of ...
Great.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
MM: OK, Geneva is Mordandis.
(Laughter) Well, it wasn't a battle, this would be, in every way, the writer you can see easily in the Plaza de Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool and has helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony, and more or less this.
The last one, after I really wanted to talk about Genova, was that of all the bars of the pork, inside the port of Genova, and I found a sound of a gun that gave me a private frequency that became the melody, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
This is his ancestor.
It's true, beautiful, now I want you to feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
And how do you feel this sound?
That's the sound of our passions in my and in your lives, and for how many people will say they're rumors, they're out of time, they really want to hear them, and I'll give you back to school, thank you!
As Guy Beck says, in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but AI, in general, the idea of the Reducation linked to the Monetary Ristitution, to Benifference.
Many times, instead, the rest is connected to the restitution of what you did, what you learned.
And from the part of those who say, "We don't do anything," then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post of 18 minutes shared some of this story.
From the end of the 90s, mainly, this is my son's paper, got back to Segrate, and in the same year, my partner organized the schooling to pay the asylum's school.
Very heavy, made with a lot of parents, but some of them said no, because we should help, we should think about the Comum State, but most of them were these extraordinary exercises to help the asylum, to help us the Commune State, and it was a dosforcement of individuals in an extraordinary place.
A few months later we went to the United States, this time is similar to the same school as a school in the neighbourhood. This is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explained that it's a totally ordinary reality, that is the thing of the "givebac" of restitution is extremely normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole society: not that the American wedding is perfect; I said this, the concept of restitution, I've had fortune, I've been able to rebuild the university, go to the museum, to theaters, there's all the communities, however, they live with a restitution of volunteers from this, and decompression.
We are already expecting, very actively, to ask ourselves, "System is one of the moment."
A famous baking lotter Obama was an incredible technological debt.
They build a study that doesn't work so many millions of situations, and this is the standard response they got, soon, critical doesn't end up for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal, trying to do and help, which is extraordinary, for us, is not a common thing.
(Laughter) This is the copertine of Time Magazine, which reinforces the savings of technologies that have been sent by Google and other companies, there are fert, and agree with the white house, they have re-architect, markerch, has put in functioning the Site in just a few cities, to one decim of the costs.
Maybe many of you would have thought, but Google probably has its own interests, and it's what I want to explain to you about what it was wrong, I've spite of people who hadn't learned a lot about their lives, who had this suit, this bag, and they've decided to repeat the experiences they'd made of their lives.
But in this case?
[A.DE.]
But they keep the ability to manage great, technological systems, complex processes, flexible, and reproduceible.
And making them again reproduce and irreplaceable, and it was a replicable system that is the YOSD of Torris, from this effort, it has been born a replicable system, what we expect to do as well.
But I want to suffer with the word models, because we also impose the models, the ones that have taught perseverance, the desire to never make any mood, to continue to insist, energy, empathy, so these are the models that are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to rest.
From the World of Risno Trai, I wanted to do it myself: for me, obviously, it has played not only what we've just said until now, but also in Italy, almost 20 years ago, through isolation, the idea of returning to help was also because it's Italian.
To be or not to do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian guitar is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Things later, we're five years old to meet things without Francisco, and we've seen it in my business in the Silicon Valley, and at the Silicon Valley, the need for transformation in general, to those things that have affected us a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes and in the digital transformation of public recording, asked me why he couldn't help us for an year's work: I think, we thought, the payment with my wife, Monica, and with my capo, Jerpeso, to make it brief, I decided to apply a methodology to prove us and I couldn't, or I couldn't, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't, or I can't try, or I can't, or I can't give up or can't.
The choice was made and so it went to Rome for two years, in the Amazon roof.
But those of you who do it like Amazon, you know, you're killed, but from something you'll get below, these are just a few leaves, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but on the positive side there was.
But I was mentally ready to choose chooticism and bureaucracy, people asked me, "But did you wish this disguise, and I didn't expect it, obviously?"
But authenticism is not often about sexism, which allows you to highlight a certain mentality, you never see it, obviously you do it because you have to say it, I feel many of this kind, in this country there is a lot of sense of common goodness.
It's about doing things because you think of helping, improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, like the military commissioner, I say this because it's the title of great, my movies, and immediately from the beginning of an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that led me to be able to assume some people from fuel of public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems inside don't transform themselves, we want to try to transform them with people outside, where the fact that we don't know the public administration is a sign, not a beach, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so it can afford it.
Here you see the post I've done when, by myself, I've realized what I'm doing, for the other, maybe some of you recognize it, that blank picture of Belgium that in 1997 has spoken about all the United States, who has given their children of the phone in all the United States, in this massive sport of vision of investments and infrastructure.
We've created the vision that the country's operative system, a series of fundamental components, which can build more efficient practices for citizens, public management and companies, through innovative digital products, a very beautiful vision of documentation, is fencing and blood.
I have continued in my place: field of warmth in salt, but that American future, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of you will say, don't know how public record works, we've already proved in many, in Italy it doesn't work.
And I am still, we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be honest and useful, others will be ugly and prejudice, the critics of the first type riding from people who really want to offer sponsorships to their contribution and we treat them a lot.
The second guy, the people who want to defend the status quo, is that they're always the animal that is flight, or that more simply they're dropped to the impointment, and this is your problem: to re-oach the things that don't work.
Remember that first image, men and women in the Times magazine copertine, here. So here, in spite of having tried to memorize as much as possible, people to do with the eye, I got around 3,000 questions, and now we are a bit of hearing people, and he was initially imprisoned to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we're talking about hydraulics.
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should be interconnected, it's silos that they don't know.
And I'm not talking only about directing and its data, its own soffers, its own applications, so it's about introducing this, writing it, explaining it, and in years, implementing it, of connectivity, of interroperability, and spends the code of people who don't want to explore their own data.
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we said, "The Spanish piano, public administration, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in my situation, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
For the first time it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the trendial piano requires a game of team to simplify amministration public, the life of the citizens, particularly of the piano, has been added once a year, because the kids couldn't be, especially in technology, and they appreciate to ministers, this is the only way to do the pieces in Italy.
It's put in a way, where we can talk to the administrators themselves, the technological ones who understand it, according to the recovering of the technological rules and it allows three types of visits and connections to other norms in other regulations, and at some point the technological rules are quite unpleasant: unfortunately they can't improve it.
And instead of thinking in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the population platforms, those are competitive platforms, the digital payments, are those things that manage in horizontal all the activity of the recording public, and more there will be: electronic payment, electronic card, and an inhabitableattack.
The thinner project that we followed at this time is called national and resident anagraffic population, is to implement, technologically all the data of the citizens, which at this time are 8,000 different media, which is the 8,000 Italian communities, in a very synchronic database, where data is talked about them, in all these places, I must say, all those things that I've already had to know about the processes.
But two weeks ago, a week ago we made a Seria Akaton, was created in 25 Italian cities, without Francesco although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from the technological point of view, like outside the state.
Behind, this concluded that we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the beautiful territory of Italy.T., where they're wovened, all documentary, in all the code, but always more, of applications.
(Laughter) In Italian administration, there will be a fifth of what should be, maybe not less.
The future is today, we dream a little, I was also working on other projects that supply don't limit themselves to do as an iraulic, I entered the ball as well.
But it's true that kids are composed, let me disappoint you, this might be, for example, one of those things briefly, to grow in an alsa, alpha, or a digital citizenship, the phone, the smartphone, the digital identity, the data of the public recording, with a little bit of: we're dreaming a little more, because work we do so much, but it's due to this vision.
In the past few weeks, the stamp has been around 150 years, and they've written an uncertainty in the world that's waiting for us, I asked many people to talk about what they think could happen, and I've been asked to talk about the simplification of life of every day of citizens, I've set up the occasions to write a article of which I want to convey some fish.
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, they're the regulation and not the action.
A country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, saying that building it, a country with strong technological abilities that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine in a country where to work for public administration is an wealthy, where the better human beings do to work in public research centers that are seen and proper centers of eccellence and innovation that leads development to the country.
Then, it's a dream.
But if there's no dream about which to punish them hardly, they can do things.
To conclude, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana made it."
And here, it served somewhere in this theater among the other, to this point, but it's easier, and you haven't managed to explain what I'm doing.
[A.DE.]
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Digital Treeumation, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
Doct!
And if you want information about us, our brain is our social system.
And what if I had the chance to make a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't work like you did?
Then, what would you change?
Have you changed, raise your hand if you'd change something about your body, maybe you'll lose some thread, or maybe you'll save your muscles.
Well, here's a bit more here, there's more freedom: raise your hand if you'll change the race, better if you want.
I was sure that I'd all be here, or maybe you'll be part of it.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question: let's try not to change each other, and the answer was different because the elementary school would have a more united family, but my parents don't separate.
At the fears I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the youngsters, Either has smelled the most complex professors, they all seemed like me and all of them reflected in music, and the greatest voices to go to the test.
Before the university I would have wanted to work, but I was stranging with the difficulties of access to the job market, and I realized that they, like me, used three strategies mainly: these strategies were used in a short dose, they could also bring some benefit, but as well as the biggest economical manovers, of interpersonal relationships, of my characteristics acquired the end of birth.
The strategy, today, the broader, is to get lamented.
We remember that there's crisis, there's no job, there's traffic, striking, and I'd have done it differently, we'd regret it because there's no injustice, with many people who stuck the mind's attention.
I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything that was to get bothered from when I started to talk, and then the young girl with whom he translated it, but to feel guilty for all of us, it's a bit like the great attempt, because with a small effort to obtain a great result, to bring back the vast of the victim, who was listened, comforted, helped.
But do it well, you can lie to the behave, or as it is much more often happening, you can lie to the right, by yours, or with friends, high voice or in your mind, because all of us would have so many reasons to let us lie down.
But the truth is that as much as you are forced to memorize hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what is harming you.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things are not going like you are, it's that of lamenting, let's press that someone is at the studio of a piano B to save your hair from the top to the magnifying glass.
Through very tiring strategies, when things are constantly streaming, it's that of imporciating, giving our pleasure, based on this mentality there's an increasing cultural factor, based on which we've learned that if something doesn't matter to us, it's sufficient to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure.
Then, you felt a bit dirty, but why can we never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it?
Your wife breaks you with strength.
With fresh effort, we've got to know how many risks we're talking about with your own demands: the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, are the coppy relationships.
I remember one, a coppy, during the school where I do nothing else, that listening to what, according to someone else, would have to change to ease the waves of their future.
And he says: "Yes."
It's certain that, to conceive you, but not even to prepare yourself in the gym, which then is a classicone, and it doesn't, if you don't listen to me, or if you don't want to make anybody else come to me uncontrol, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to be, to rest our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that, if we say this thing often in good feet, believing deeply, we can hardly change something, but, instead of having to remove this odds at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigating them to apply them, if the strategy that privileges are full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there are no tools, like a tool, take the forehead, put it underwear.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the attempt to confront the conflict that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of altruistic needs.
I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often went through the roof that the time was openly locked in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other, in this limited situation.
There are important things that I learned, for example.
To listen to accept and accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from theuna of the other, but on the other hand, he never learned to say no to the things that didn't know them, and to need to ask yourself how many, it is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, I will finish to disrupt them.
And to feel sorry, it requires your needs or to suffer them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause-function because I myself in my life, in my life, has abused.
I tell you what happened to me.
If I'd like to keep complaints with us, I had to accept a disorder, one day, the primary of the hospital where I collaborated for, I sent me to call and said, "But Zuccelle, here, for her, there's no longer room, and she showed me a far away place to do a job that neither there was a big deal with all that I'd studied until then."
Then I got to know how to die, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never have to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
And there I learned that to obtain different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
And changing if you, if I changed, others would have to change, change, change.
If I became a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unico, my primary school wouldn't have sent me a way, if I had done it, things wouldn't take me more than that, but perhaps I would have gone to me, first, I wasn't that person.
But the answer wasn't in the hill of others, but I had to ask my responsibility profound.
Because things don't change.
We are the ones who change.
That's not the case.
And the first change we have to do is to accept the choice of choosing ourselves, choosing yourself as a cause of things that are not going like you.
Keep in yourself as a cause of things that don't go as far as you are.
This is our challenge.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll be alone and willing to confront something much greater, and I'd like to say, "To acquire new skills or consolidate those you've already had, you can work on you to become just one, because life is from those who do it, get up."
And if inside the tank, things don't go well, you think that it's the other side to where to take the first step.
And in this way that I create a mental space, I used to go to the research of his circumstances, now you see the research of his needs, then things change, what I can do today as a different way to make his best magazine, he is sending him a message of inadequity.
If you are one of those people who go with everyone, who must always say that yes, one of those people that I call, lose me in the end, prostitute and relational.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do when I was writing to university, I had a dream: So the game becomes something else, inside of which you can become a tennis standard, right?
I had to get lamented or maybe not to explain how many good psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to give up my dream: No, I had to learn to speak a language, which was not happening, but near the agget, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs, instead of being mine.
And in the turn of a short time following this instruction?
I achieved the results for me inimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and in the end I decided I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he intended, I came back here.
I got to the case, I did a computer, and I recorded a video that I cartooned on YouTube in which I spoke about psychology, here in the channel captured firewoods, because there might be some of them saying.
(Laughter) In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channal is a reference point in Italy, for the purpose of psychology in video, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people, psychology getting closer to discussing some of the stereotypes that we first warned you: the dreams, something in common, of sharing psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director and today, every two months, in the best and in Italy.
They don't become real because, fortunately, because you've had this opportunity, the story you have to have is the one you hold, the one you carry on, the ones you don't know how to build and you need to reflect, because the topic should you do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your bones of always, here.
If there's something I've learned from all this journey to improve?
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent one, ten motivations made a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life, that doesn't happen as well, we have talked about the work, the physical aspect, the current conting?
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least proveing, it's a small question that I personally was very useful, and it's based on logic that in order to produce great changes, it's to focus on many small actions: what's the simplest thing and the simplest thing?
Your life in the directions you've dared, you can think what is the smallest and simplest thing you can do, until now, at the end of the store, to tell yourself in case after this beautiful day and that will allow you to take the first step.
See, you've got the keys of the frugone, the one who's eating today, or who's doing now part of the pullman, ugly, but where I put the packs... Fedemma, martiets are the proves, or we'll hide it?
Or on her feet, which is now about mutating?
Oh, you see, when I arrived to my mother, do you know what?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
And I put it aside.
Well, this time I want to take this by myself, here.
But I had a dream.
With diverse ages and different abilities, to create a integration band: percussions are so fast, so immediate, they access distances and join battles.
But we are part of it.
We are part of the sets.
Beh, if these kids I see them, eye, Laura, Paola, Niele, I saw them grow, our provides were mariday, mariday was the day of evidence, where they entered this room in the Andreoli music school.
They were pulling the first bidonies, they were together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become a group marathon, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw the first ones, the first markets in the likes, the first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012, the world was crossed, in the real sense of the word.
Tutts of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake we filled our land, and from that moment on, we were the thousands of earthquakes.
For all the gusts we called this.
As I mentioned, the cases were no more accessible, many crooks: our living room provided, our place where all marriages were completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
B.G: Me, Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, we've all focused on them.
The endless voter, the erlopi.
We got there: fortunately, we met you all.
We've all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of manitis, of thousands, we've been feeling fearing the strongest, because the flag or the seeds are stronger than the earthquake, inside that thend of things happened magnificent, because the Earth that believed in order to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
There, we've built the first tools: sci-fi belt.
They became the shelves, the tubes that became...
From the building and combined with ping pong roots, to take out bills with markets, shoot.
We were constantly washing, always, there was an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
Already there, our first spettacol was born, while the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to speak for 20 years, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We began with the construction of the first spettacol: white man, because there were smaller lights, the larger lights and the white man, at that moment, we all moved together as a white lighter.
After a while, we did the year later, we did the other spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also have a moment from our land, and last year after we had cracked, this marine monster, right away.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender, and none of us would have ever thought that a tone could change our lives.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
150 impacts in return to the state.
The stage of the first master?
The concert, in the TV program at my friend's house, is the school playground, and we really did a lot of things.
And also for me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly me.
It's exactly the circumstances of life, that of fatigue, of sudden, but also of freshness, that has so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back to the seeds, they expect that there is still so much to build, thanks to everyone.
One, two, three.
(Applause) One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation, talked about social innovation, my name Maria Cristina Ferradini, and, in fact, I'm born as a approach, at the moment I've been dominated, that has happened in the last 25 years.
In these 250 years the industrial revolution, the internet revolution, and the phone, and then the vaporean motor, is not only a vapore mask, but for example, an animal, I believe almost all of us, we are trying to understand, but what happened in these three, for example, because it has, in some way, storically, the industrial revolution, which is in the internet revolution, which is known, in some way, in some way, the vapore mask in the vaporea, and in the vaporea, in a way, which is evolving, in some way, in a way, because it is evolving.
We don't need only one butter motorcycle, for example, we need to use auto-mobility industry: In reality, first, it was served in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motorbike that couldn't go from weight, when we couldn't understand how to make the script out, for the Italian industry, to the motorcycle, and all that was derived, but not only.
And in the Industrial Revolution we are still debates, for example, for the phone, it is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to reveal our letters, from one part to the other of the world, always smaller than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us and has taught us to deposit the digs under the sea.
And yes, because after the phone we could try it in the sea, and then what we had to interrupt everything: no, we had to move forward, we had to digs under the sea, the first cave left.
And we're around 1858.
And that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is continental energy, in Europe, was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
In that year, on December 30th, the scat was illuminated.
CR: A part of our history was swimming from there, amongstors that in the beginning of the '50s, they could be in a stance like this, and they simply had it more raped, which is still high, but don't know yet because they've experienced important emotions in a more significant way, more structured, always more intelligent, and they've become garbage collectors.
And these responses, called ARPA, ARPANET on the Internet, started to bring information to collect information and were 25 million, a broadcast, or global, non-archical, that we know, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of tens of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to copy data, to collect data or to develop data.
When the functional strength started to drop artificial intelligence, which was in a substitute way, which was introduced by the industrial revolution.
And mobility?
And this is an industrial process that tells us that what is new, progressively, does what's old, because it needs to make space, and we'll see better then as: but this is the story of the great numbers, of big inventions, but it's a story that is a little more complex that has started to live the water that we've lived right now, that we're living now, trying to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, from the scale, I still haven't done the Italians yet.
Minister Minghetti, provided in entrance exams, establishes that the 27th century of the doctor, is exposed, the payment is public dependencies.
And from 27 of the successive months after this happened, in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their capacity to produce goods that were necessary in their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the less risky stages of the sanitation, somehow started to move away from the land, and especially, has transformed the power of production of goods and practices in the power of producing a good, the money.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also the industrial system that allows us to keep in a massive way, a structured way, in a healthy way, in a quantity of food.
So, there is also the chance, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the emergence of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live at the speed of challenges, the speed of movements, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, which is a element that we can define as the qualificator of these years, in the midst of time, as we said, arrived at the computer and arrived at the internet, we now do things fast, and we move fast, and we move fast, and we move fast, and the speed of our thoughts.
And until when something happened, basically it's close when you keep the story, to understand the messages from one seventh to another and see some date that aren't necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2001, when we can say it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two date that are significantly indicating the passing of one hour or another, 2001 because in total.
And the American economy started to slow down, and the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, and we were taken to be very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the East, but as we could not imagine a crisis of this dimension.
With many fewer people.
What did those companies do, they didn't innovate in inventing something, they didn't innovate in building something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done buying and selling, learning, and taking, in a different way, in a more efficient way.
And the adventure, the adventure so often denied, we are almost close to a fast connection for the 50th century: we look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors, the connectivity, the informal skills of the digital systems, those advances, which allow us to develop.
The use of the Internet, frankly, is enough to look at the news and see that we are growing fast, there are new internal operators, new competitions, which are building a tiger, so businesses, a third fact that we must look at the use of growth in a speed completely athetic up to two years ago, so we're really looking for seconds.
Actually, a very profound change has been born, not comparable to large multinational companies, and there are competences and digital inclusion in prisons, and in this way we have to pay a lot of attention, we have two motors for the characteristics of our country.
This heritage inside a knowledge system, that allows us to bring it and disporte it to make it notable, and to bring the most efficient collective tools inside these reality, but possible that these reality can become the richness of our thesis around you, and we're teaching it, and this is the first as we have the first large anologic and the first large anologic: they're agile, they're small, small, small, small, small, small, graduate, finance, inequality, finances, and then Rome, they repeat things, and then they repeat things over our country and again.
But if someone asked you, with Abruciapello, we're going to say in the 21st century, inequality in the world, inequality in the network of citizens in the world has increased, if maybe I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start, in a certain sense, the opposite of sharing, that would answer, or will be reduced, too.
I've been asking these questions in the last years, and with only 24 hours the performance of video, I've prepared with my colleagues a report on inequality, from when they are data, that is to support from the 60's center, to the highest majority of countries in the world.
And the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality, of the network of world citizens, as you can see, it was indeed an increase over the 90s, but from the end of the year 2000, at the end of the 1980s and 90s, but in the last 20 years, practically, we have a tendency to descendent disguection.
And how can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is to say, "We weren't wrong with the meaning," and there's certainly in this letture, but maybe we're wrong with the idea of inequality in which we reason.
Maybe we give time to the subsequently this question, and let's move around around a century, we need to reflect on the issue of inequality, it requires some review, and also of the "Skance."
And he saw a problem for that, because the question he was doing Keynesse, but with all this time he was free, he knew much less, he tried a week of 15 hours of work, he pronounced a speech in front of an hour of three hours of work every day, that is where he's going to say, slowly to 100 years old, and this teacher would be found with a consequence, in an idea, effectively, in reality, in fact, in fact, a little or twice, in a workplace, in a worker or sometimes in a while, in a lab was still in the lab.
Apparently, this second company didn't become realised, we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not realised anywhere, we'll hear those suits in Italy, because we see it all and we don't work hard, and it doesn't seem exactly what we're working with tomorrow.
G.G: This one.
And what's interesting is that this 16% of its life naturally work force, that is, during 15 years, when we deal with this trajectory, represents the fraction of time dedicated to work throughout his life, and now we call it around 16 pitch, which is the barrier of three hours in Italy, we've already melted it.
Well, naturally.
If this happened there are also reasons for survival reasons and if you want banals, our children often study long, they even study up to 25 and 30 years, so young age is aligned, but there is a reason, perhaps more important, for which our time quote.
So, dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
(Laughter) This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see that...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70 percent.
Today, we are very low, we are around 50 scars, but from 1900 that means that there are more people who don't work, that is, consumers who don't get any income, are more than workers.
FdB: Is the frontier of this?
Farming action: we can also have a reaction.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have been in the same way because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation in Italy.
And there were conflicts: this is the storic series of time.
According to the work in life, as you can see, in the United States only goes to the '30s, it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument while we believe it, but even more impressive, and the storage amount of the occupation rate, as we can see here.
There is an increase, the pictures you see underwater is the crisis of 29: we have a general trend of the rate of occupation in the USA to the economy, in this case, we have a situation of reducing the rate of occupation.
But then, this idea of learning is a pathology.
But it's not normal, isn't it?
Yes, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
And it's not normal that most of the population lives in a sentence I defined -
Difference in parassity, regardless, because depending on the website of your wisdom, this to you can also be a family member or the state, but would also be sympathetic because I consumed or the available net without working.
But me, a friend who did theatre's work, when I found these results, we went to the scene and I asked them to do it.
And you, as you showed this situation with an image, a situation of sympathetic dependence, and you know what answered me?
With Epopopotam, it's the moon that lives on the backs of the hypothama, which is called buffago, some of them say buffaga, here, here.
(Laughter) If you want to have an idea of how buffaging is involved or buffaga on the other side, or on the other great mammals, these animals also live on the sidewalks, on buffets, well, we have this movie that will be some indicated in which you see.
[A.DE.]
So, animals, these murderers.
How do you live?
As we define, a society in which there is this kind of improductive consumption, the first one that you can significant is harmful from hell, but I'm not a hypothesis, this is: if Bouffal is accumulated, if the question that I've done as a sociologist is supposed, and it's not enough, you have to add a qualification.
It's that it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
And here the rapping is clear: it's a relationship between eating and submission, in the sign language society has become a lot, and the relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated, with a lot of legacy.
FdB: The relationship?
The buffaco with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food located in the fields of Eppopore, the Indian disadvantagy.
Because we can't, we can't think of the hypothms, we don't need buffes, but it's also from the perspective of producers, we also have a face slope, a green slope, the hypothms and automobile, it doesn't need a buffer, but it's somehow a very complex memory of obligation, and this is a situation of tweet lips, but a situation.
That it's not okay.
This is a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we came to the question that I had done talking about Keynes: the access to work we can use NASA and the inequality of access to work, there are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two workers.
And the position of the art, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: the best situation, that of Norway, with the United States, in the middle.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
As we arrived at this, this is the history of inequality in access to work in Italy, always measured with the efficient decent, you can see somethingamorous, that inequality is the minimum during monarchical age, particularly under the second Republic which in which we live in, in most of the year, and our state, there are 7 million viewers of jobs in more than our families, in Italy.
CR: But it's here concluded.
But there's one.
And we had the scholarship to write in the first art of the Constitution, and we were the last country, together with the Turkey of the West.
So, or we change things, and we create the seven million work positions that are missing, or maybe it's better to download the article of Costitution, and things are like BEFA and ARSR.
