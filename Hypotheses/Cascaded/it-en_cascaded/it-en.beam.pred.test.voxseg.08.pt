Controlated.
Poorry?
And fragility.
And some of you will know what to do, these two words apparently far away.
Be, you must know that, until some time, my two larger memories, Mars and Francesca.
And, in addition, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
But the words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years pass, the child becomes a boy.
But it suffers a lot, a lot.
With this problem of the bullies, it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, logo psychologists, all the courageous people, brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, she found a little girl.
It wasn't called Walt Disney.
The Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
You'll ask a child, what happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
Instead...
The child thought, "I'm not.
Interesting.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
GB: But a good day?
And at the dawn of his country, they were celebrating a big party with a clich√© and a microphone right there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man, of feeling the potatoes he had written, the comic fights were too big, and he didn't think about it: coming gradually from the surgeon, take the microphone and says, "Salva todos, I'm a computer engineer, think they're so brave in the internet that my first words as I was born were: web, web!
And that's what happened.
People liked it, and he was happy because the words used fluid, in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
And something was successful, but the most beautiful thing.
And this young man, at that time, was that people didn't laugh anymore.
They were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my family would have interrupted me and I would have said, "Yes, man, we understood that you are TED."
And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say about strength.
Then, I thought, "Yes, guys, that's a bit the problem of having Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
And, in other words, they would get the best of themselves.
What is a moment, I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part, and if it also works the opposite.
And then?
Because I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
It didn't work.
Well, people, all the people I've met and have become part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
But believe me, finding...
A disability, and can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or it is becoming a genius.
It's generating.
Disability.
Well, that ...
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife who is in the fifth, a physician shells us to flood in a very small stone, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single sedentary.
And she makes my wife walk again.
Take the paper and read.
A 21 trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Boom is angry.
A: Not to be afraid.
But my wife's father's harp.
She says, "Yes, puzzled, dotted, but our son is a mask and a female."
The doctor says, "Scuse me, maybe she didn't understand, trisomy 21."
It's the Down syndrome.
My wife answers.
And no, as a doctor, I understood great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female.
Then the dotter is always more spathetic, close.
And then I, as a matter of qualma, pork, misery, we don't even know when we managed to make a mask out of nothing, but it's dark.
And the dot has given the head to the dot.
Well, we move hard on this thing, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in the world.
Also our lives, because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyone.
KP: After a few months.
It has come.
Unda.
I'll introduce it to you.
(Applause) A marvelous!
It's so beautiful!
It's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
Now this is not the potential.
But we noticed one thing.
That all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, especially from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, analysis, we know everything, but few, very few of these people have had encounters with people.
Clothesability.
And then, to put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Second Anna".
Therefore, without asking too much about seriousness, but just for nothing, let's tell the notable noices that take, for example, a little while ago Francesca came home and said, "Do you know that they use the way you go to school?"
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you may wear, but you know you know, how you were heavy..." "Blow this one, and you'll be here," so this part is here.
Or another one, where it says, "But is it true that you suffer from Down syndrome and don't give birth to blue eyes?"
(Laughter) Bella is said "Excompulsion of ideas."
Because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in addition, I don't know, I'll give you an example: have you present TED, you include a small X?
[A.DE.]
No, why am I showing you this example?
Why you?
Why do you, today, for us?
To confess TED, talk to people, you made a little bit of fatal.
So the invitation is to make a little bit of fat, and not avoid the disabled encounters in your life, as individuals, as well as people around you, a very powerful recommendation.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on or a bathroom.
Well, to wake up the eyes you have to put them at the same level.
And in this sense, it captures me many times of losing, that's why I like a politician to leave rooms long my stories, and yet I've done this afternoon, with this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability, so I can't just allow you to look for paths of disability in your life, to enhance them.
And most importantly.
And remember that the ladies who were able to look in the face turn into courage.
Thank you.
And I thought that in order to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like the masoce, whoever lives.
Handy, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And I understood what my mission was in the world.
In fact, it wasn't even a bunch of birds, or a romantic disorder, as we've told you some of the speakers earlier, but for an ortag, it didn't go well, it could be an intern, because it was thanks to a carcass, so I'm very fortunate, and maybe many of you are captured while you collect an ortags to realize how much it happens every day.
KA: This is the scarcity percentage, it's what happened to me at night, thanks to a traffic, and this has opened my mind, it has made me a little change of prosthesis.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
G: food?
That's what we have more freedom to choose.
It's the reason we can decide, for us, for our family, every single day.
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but also an environmental impact that might be the way we dress or how we fly to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
And it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied.
Every day's life, especially what's our inhale with food.
To optimize means, for example, the way we use sponsors.
Then, how much we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors.
And then, obviously.
Trying to use 100% of the subjects.
It's also about consumers, optimizing consumers, and especially the way in which we create the behavior every day.
So, theattoo, what are we really wearing the table?
Lili scares, I'm part of this project, so, through the encounter with affection.
I propose the end of the file, of the rejects, of what we often use here, where in front of you have a small example of scary against the first towns, we are used to do what I'm doing now, every day at home, when we pull the vegetables.
And to separate from one part, there is the noble part that we use and on the one hand, there is the scary.
And the scary, so the less noble part, is in average to at least 50% in winter, reaches up to 70 feet, because a lot of vegetables have more protected areas.
So what optimizing in the kitchen means to simply recover those things from rejects, means changing food, that means using 100% of the raw materials, but that's not mean having a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joke together, let's take an example with the window.
Mela can see her as, okay, a candle, but I can also see her as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup.
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us behave.
And the hat?
Magarius I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria, it probably costs more, the treasure, the focus, and I'll put it to every ingredient moment, another example, one of the ants that can make us more time to breastfeed.
I love 100%, for example, juice me a lot because the bus is the veracity, the one where the fiber is concentrated.
It's less than the dust, which perhaps if you don't like the dust too much, you can concentrate on the bus, and it's also the part that has more fibers, so a benefit certainly for health, but not only, with all internal features, I can prepare one thing, I think it's a practical example.
It's a very easy technology, but it allows us to transform, also to value.
Something we all have at home is that we usually don't stop looking at and traveling, so we optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that, changing our mentality a little and seeing with a different eyes.
particularly the ants, but all the food.
To sprease less and appreciate the maximum, optimize also means optimizing the consumption of energy heater, for example, every time I contain and toothpaste or vegetables, in contemporary, water had other things.
To make verdors is enough to have posters, it's not that good to say what, or what.
Sometimes I use an electronic device like lavatovicles.
And also use it to cure, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure some of you are going to be born.
But it's a very small kitchen technique, low temperature, so it doesn't happen that you buy a professional tool for 2,000 euros.
But you can simply use the washing machine every time you wash your ants, like a very practical example: you take a glass like this, you must be hermetic.
For example, let's take a new copper with the water and youth it well, and put it in half the golden broad, the wave warning must not be filled, full of hatisports like always.
And then you have the sheet you prefer, you choose based, of course, to the mirror of theatti and not vice versa, when the sheeting ends, your fears will be to the Kok, wet, or bathtub, according to the sheet you chose.
And it will be fantastic because it will be at a low temperature, so much better than the classic paved, an amazing consistence, so we can also optimize the use of the highest apps that could hardly obtain with traditional technology, another application of optimizing this time to the rat, I enter even more into the house in your home, when we were in war, OK.
There was a lot of food.
And we had few proteins, they would eat a lot of potatoes, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the table on, for example, the carts, the protective jokes, it was a party, and it worked like that.
Now, the problem is the opposite: we have so much abbondance and we have a little tendency to put everyone in touch the doppy of proteins that are useful for us, because it's a problem, it's a problem, because we're actually fighting rays, featured, and also increasing the risk of developing some pathology, and so it's one thing ...
It doesn't do us, so the classic portion of the recording, but also that we make ourselves in our hands, that can be from our legs to our fish, in fact it's too frightening, and eating so many vegetables, in fact, we take a large part of our we need daily proteins.
So eating more than what is useful is a waste of resources, it is certainly something that we could improve, if more these proteins are animal proteins that have certainly an environmental impact.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put some less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have a major supply environmental benefit.
It's about our health, but also of the kings of all of our country, even more if we did it at the world level.
Also in public spirits for health.
It's one.
A benefit of well-being of the singing and of course for the society, I believe that we'll be ready, we don't need to worry about eating enough, but not eating too much, that's the problem of proteins, and above all, try to persuade you, and more likely to privilege the animals with a low environmental impact, which will be asking you.
Well, in other words, next year, Apple will also be, and there are a lot of people that talk about food of the future: food of the future, I mean many insects.
Personally, I think I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me.
We are not just a consumer country, and I think we'll hardly become one, but there's also a protein food which is absolutely here in zero.
What can we do to make ourselves more self-productive at home?
And that, even more, we can nourish from vegetables, maybe not the ones that will be carried on a store, but the things that might be that we can't use what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the hypicies that are with me on the stage today, in other words, of the store, that, even more, we can nourish, of plant scars.
It's a part of the Italian tradition.
And here in the room, who among you has never eaten the lights?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, there were more eatingers of bright lights, around 35 years ago a law that prevented us from collecting them, not only for food use, but also because they are used for money and for other users, but it's a food that also ask for chef friends.
It's really so much to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, it's enough to know what to do: to save your moon that's home, just a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of land, a queue, to not make them scape.
The man who, in reality, comes alone, is enough to get rid of the animal, or you can pick uova, then feed it with vegetables, and twice in the year, you will have your harvest in a primary, like an ortagger, required a time of covering around an hour, and then you can do what you wanted, so from the level.
And that can, in my opinion, not only to be the food of the future, but also food of the present, I hope that the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they would never eat them, that surely they brought a small change of mentality and surplus of a prejudice, so sustainable revolution, I'm convinced that it can be the cover of any of you.
And that really riches a small change, of course.
A change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices are conscious that to ask you to carry the lavahies, eat all the loops, start to compensate the loves that isn't such a simple thing, but I'm a very optimistic person, and so unit of me became revolutionary, because benefits are really many, are for our health, for well-being.
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you.
QD: I brought two data with me.
One, no?
A piece of data with six faces, take part from one to the other.
The other one.
But he went to ten gangs.
If I launch it, any value from one to ten has the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play.
And you launched the side of ten gangs.
And I can do it.
Let's start this game, put an equal or largest number of mine.
six to five.
Happings have come to play.
Trying with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
But you must say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
That's not the case.
I spy.
But I can completely release data and take the data of every victory.
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventy seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you'll see that the probability of victory approaches 75%.
And with the remote increase, my stomach based on the media of the succession.
It gets more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
And then ...
Well, if you had a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portable must deliver to launch the incidents?
100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method.
We can simulate a number of data, but also...
The behavior of a fluid.
Or the evolution of a colony of a epidemic.
Or even the abandonment of financial systems.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
It's simply a way of magic, and that's why.
Four years ago I began my PhD in the middle of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
And unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which I was so much streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
The environment of work is at exceptional level.
I have my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the end of the day, and the two professors that follow me are intelligence, competition and humanity, unstoppable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technical, often frustrating, and also based on innovative research.
Behind, behind every Vincent ITA, there are 10, 130 attempts to fail.
And the dot can be a lonely path.
I spend most of my time sitting on a computer or on a statistical article.
What can we do?
Behind these ambtacoli would be a lonely passion that I wasn't foreseen.
That's it.
Even in motion, they seem to be used for a bunch of gold for a mathematician who studies the west.
But I can guarantee you that at that moment, my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how tight you think, teach Maths and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson.
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending.
Everything that I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
But I didn't want to answer this question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I spoke to a genius.
I started to live in lessons and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to prepare lonely, I wanted to compassionate my students, to get involved, to surprise them.
and make them fun.
But I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
I got a diploma in didors with university, and I began to teach two hours to the students of the first year to more than eight years old in births of the most advanced things.
The more workplace was, the more I became efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Or preparing the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
But I really like to collect my compounds.
To read the lessons to the students, the right mistakes they are, provides a continuous learning.
It's a poet.
There's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a show.
And in each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
The gratitude of the studios paid entirely all my bill.
And I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my PhD, I got so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
It was all so natural, beautiful, approaching.
But in my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to address your own passions.
What's the point?
I have to face everything that had happened in such a short time.
To answer that question, the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, fuel, the limitations of determination?
The place I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that are sparked between more people, instead of evaluating that value.
Is there a concert?
Good afternoon.
Stad, at this event.
Or a stone, a book, a trip?
Or an experience, an operation, a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind?
And it will be in the movement, at the moment I had tried to put the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
We won't be seen.
But I've told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
A method to explore this part, for example, the fact that we undertake a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or to find end up motivating in the street that there were no expectations, like catalizing our talents.
And the culture of sharing.
There's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams: there are more richer than the students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
Have you ever seen herself?
I switch my voice, it's already silent.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl, in the first row, asks me if I can give some instructions about women's questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to witnessed the friends of five years old, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have instructions.
In another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had little time to practice.
But there's a lot of subject in the Internet, and there's a lot of money to be found on the screen.
I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
I scratch to the food, but I often live to them to ask how to procedure, to each point of practice, we build a element of theory that we repeat the stages together.
Anyone makes a very difficult question.
But I've had the gift of their gender book: I'm well prepared, I'm fled.
I start with them to make them take the breath: it's a saying, fly, and I encourage them to the glass for the exam.
A group of students breath.
But someone asks for evidence, but most of them only reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
I've got money.
But he teaches him how to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
Alright.
Take the courage, just to tell me.
But I just want to thank you.
Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
I stay only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart.
And I think that maybe...
This is exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
This is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are worthy.
And that's why, when the mind is in motion, the heart beats within the country.
(Laughter) I'm a mind runs.
G.G.
I created November 24th, 2003, moving it, financed by researching cancer to the prostate, in more than 29 million dollarians, that started to grow up the bathrooms, and they started to get prepared completely from the students, to the scope of promoting the dialogue, and it was already a global movement, which is sold in more than 219 million dollari.
Good afternoon everyone.
And today I want to tell you how a voter has changed my vision about leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
And that's how a bit of freshness came into a bar, I wrote a book.
And as it was often a captain, when I read and when I drink something, it started to make me out of others, it started to listen to other conversations, then there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
What's interesting about the change is that, as the law has told us before, it was a central issue, my colleagues were in a very clear way: now we all approached the change, the first thing that you have is beyond fear.
Your diversity, your diversity, your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
A: It seems to give it.
This concept of change, which is the most normal thing, actually doesn't get used to wear, right?
And the opportunity appears here, right now, from diversity, in other words, as integrating.
Well, all that has brought a different look, remember my daughter one day.
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of friends, girls, and at some point the girl says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Clo, we are really three men," and says, "No, no, they are both, you are with mom!"
And I guarantee you: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
So this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
Proprio A.
But constructing to model, to find a meaning response, and that's a bit the difficulty, but because if on one hand you want to create a culture of change, on the other, you need to create leaders of change, that I've been working for many years in companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
But it's not the immediate thing.
The brightest leaders do this too.
Always, when I drink this cave, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
But the word change accounts this word of change, I get a thinking that brings me - I don't know how many hours - and it begins to put into other words, transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and form an encouragement, hunt.
Knowing that in reality is a prison, it's a bit of fulfillment that, to me, is clearly this prosthesis of personal entirety.
QD: Today, a leader must have, meaning you must know how to be, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an accident, it is to know that creative transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
And what happens then?
Instead of doing something else.
And then the prosthesis is the change of prosecutive change that I thought, but, the ability to take this leap, to do things, to enjoy beautiful things.
to create projects.
Take people from one place to another to be, and in this being there is a transformation that also transforms you, also transforms me.
Isn't it?
I'm working on a project, I'm paid on the project, but what is the transformation that I carry, and all that I do, thanks to the development of creative thinking, which is a bit of leading it to change this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've imagined it, then, through five pillars, a little the ability to dream, that is that everyone is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of ads, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity.
S simple: "Samattina we started with a tunnel, with brainstorming, it's one of you that allows you to fulfill your creativity.
What do you do with creative thinking, trying to work on divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but this is not enough, you have to take a leap and...
And to make a slightly deliberate movement, right?
And starting to involve that which is the emotional part, the frightening of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first.
Well, to precisely try to express your emotions and emotions, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
Here's the fear, that when you feel that it's not courageous and to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's also those, when you know about your emotions, you can let yourself support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing -
That's it.
CR: It's not that you become indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you make a modification.
But in fact, no, but you live in a transformation that is personal, consciousness of both emotions leads you to do this.
To give several examples of leader who have made these tests, just to suffer in Italian countryside, certainly deserved.
It has ended up with Rome, but at the same time Chico, who has Mility, you know that the other day has printed as the business of...
The world's immension, exactly for innovative and is growing up to 67%, that is to say what?
Transformations.
They see how to say inside, but there's not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the only difficulty today is in supporting the leader.
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
But something that has a concrete impact inside organic interactions, what does this mean?
Because nourishing means that every day you build the contents in which people ...
It can beaten on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can relate to each other, but they can also allow each other to get wrong, and this is not that simple in organic contacts, because there is always the results's as if the results were all gathered in just one way.
But on the other hand, dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, it also offers the opportunity to do that, to explore new ways.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and, in the end, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Do I get involved in collecting creative spirit?
It's here.
Well, this is precisely the impact you have when you do this, when you get involved in dreaming, it has an impact that necessarily happens if you don't act as an organization, but also to re-invent the customer relationship.
And the prosthesis is completely changed.
Then, to return.
It's to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
We can change our paradigm, change our paradigm, in other words, what to happen in the situation of being conscious, of reaching the creative effect, but of putting ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not so wrong.
Well, the sense of attention we have seen in the video before.
It's like saying: guide is the volcano for the development of creative thinking.
But this feels clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, that of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen first inside of you.
And then out, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to act.
Let's light the belt of security.
But how many times will you be captained?
And it's the only thing around you?
But there is a chance in it.
Then, let's see from above.
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most diffused invention of man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
It's for thousands of years.
Check it out!
These places to be together can be fun.
They can live not all separated, but together.
But in that one...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: But it's positive or negative all this, but would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest tapir.
It's more populous from the West.
And how do you see it?
Maybe it doesn't hurt, and in fact, in this city started.
What we see in the longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
It's obviously the growing process.
And these two kids started, then.
I have become quite famous.
Kar Magh.
He's his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
(Laughter) They didn't see what today captivates you when you do your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
FdB: I looked at him.
Strad dead, without daughters.
Besides, it's a bucket.
The question, but not that of today, the true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks prevented the view of a collision.
And of course, both write with the book.
Because it was called condemn.
One of the operating classes in cities.
where the city was accused.
To all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be a cause.
Inquination, insicurity, poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible.
How to say?
It's a malicate reach.
Behind, something necessary, but it can contain.
And what about this?
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
But I was also born with tools to limit this phenomenon called Chiara.
Probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
(Laughter) Sciences were born: arbacist.
What do you see here behind?
It's one thing.
It's a tremendous feeling that, maybe, some of you have heard about, that has bizzy tools: one that's called quite a service, which is a rock where, when you have to change a glass at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
And then?
Behind, pianification.
The piano, in other words, the idea that there is someone from the event that has to dream.
GV: The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or is it still for the reason why, fortunately, you have never met?
Anyone, but what can you even say?
It's about imagining a centimeter of the city.
What should happen in the future?
It's a house.
Here's an ufficio, a theater.
Pah!
But let's also imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about the cities.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Where is Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable isolation, a city full of violence and tender, so much to abandon it, and perhaps for those who watched the movie, you remember, it becomes a jail where all the world's communities are launched by thealto and scanned for this.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all the processes, this was also for example a little lung from 1845.
There's a 'anni' window.
The sentence comes.
If I'm a scientist in science, this sentence, it's a total solution sentence.
But not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
Then you find out that the city is not the cause of everyone, then in the world.
Thinking the growth of the population.
Forget it.
It's the solution.
All the greatest questions here are related to the human brain.
But demography?
Inquination, environmental sustainability, safety, economic development, work creation.
It's the ability to create knowledge.
In fact, this feeling also fits three.
The important elements that motivate this ability, which is the city to improve the world, the first one.
It's the density, can you see what myallels are?
This is my picture from the upset of my city.
Therefore, the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations they can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
Because there are many countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks and others who also ignore me the most famous calling.
And the tracing element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare where billions of people, for one afternoon, have a carpet, a midday at home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
And then?
Here's my idea.
That the city, in the end, is scared, and in some way addressed as a solution?
Well, it's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
But the vastness, the people, we are all used to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the PIB, no, the city, a mechanism.
The city works and solves the greatest question of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A huge mechanism that transforms, different interests.
How many individuals from stories?
That if you decide to go on a trip together with a bus litgrimage all day, but the city now enters magically, depending on individual interests, well-being sidewalks, and therefore the city definition is no longer a statical definition.
Now we know some cities, in Italy, even bigger, the city can also lose its status, the city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating this positive transformation mechanism.
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that, right now, in some moments, or in some periods, they may be.
This virtuous mechanism and then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
But we must pass by ...
Behind, mechanisms of human containment, to mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and that they are not afraid of the human phenomenon.
But what?
They try to feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example is Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From these satellites, and some of them are evident, not all of them.
A group of green, unknown, at the center of the city, ten minutes per meter, from the bus.
That was my idea together.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years, with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
And to name this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
But as the urban stage, the largest in the world: 72 km of green, an orbital park.
That every day you can walk, how do you do it?
Being an example?
To see the lifestyles?
And can you imagine?
Then, as a element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things?
It's one of the systems we live in.
Don't let us go.
Sure, we say...
Distrugging.
"Ah, the cheap of ego!"
With Gettorica, still novoking.
But first of the lack of solution, cities like nurses.
What pelled, the cement?
I don't know if you've all remember these stories.
The second example is now that.
Namous billion km of the harp.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina it's the capital.
And it was put in a quesit for a few years.
What can we do with this city in 2030 with all of them happy?
Buenos Aires, more than in other years.
The country is the magnetic.
But from all over the nation.
Where is the place?
Everyone sees a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed you.
Who's somehow blind?
Violence, poverty.
It was also caused by a more enjoyable national crisis.
And what's the temptation?
But he is alone!
The one that...
Limitate development, and it's now courageous.
Sparating the vast!
Incredible!
It's the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Put yourself where.
What do development accelerate?
It's not what you see here?
Gioque deinci.
But there is a huge population.
A magician in frutture.
It's the creation of...
If you pedaled or checked.
This one.
Addense.
Piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in much more life.
To build.
Situiting.
(Laughter) Yearday more, I lived with more densic rooms.
- Boh!
But the population not only of the agency, but from all over the world is creative, to meetings.
Then we build a system of infrastructure.
Okay.
Slowing.
That allows us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
One of the social spaces.
- Yes.
Diver and pedonals.
It's this tragedy, fight together.
They were about the development of Buenos Aires, about science?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all, in the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Ciao!
By following the location on the end, you will see from thealto, this great invention of humanity.
Why is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
BB: Tant times.
Can you imagine that?
Happy birthday.
to live in what we call.
The section of cities.
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
They give way to our thinking: the words of our language.
They are extraordinary, they are vocative that are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion, of waves.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
FdB: Once again.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'm going to talk about art.
A huge idea.
It's the English year, the school...
Provincial, motivated, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But the penis was a bit longer and I'm going to show you.
Some endless twins.
They have many Latins on their insign and the world's greatest universities, and they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are in a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia, in Svezia, in the UK, in Oxford.
But in Chicago, in the United States.
Wow!
It says "goods" in their insign, not just universities.
Surely.
They will say, in Latin, "Only rounds have a Latin motto."
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
The 15L, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not just: well!
(Laughter) The American Marina says, "Semper to finish, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin and even an announcement isn't stupid to be passengers, like NASA reminds a Latin motto to the emissions of chicken, why am I doing it so long with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
What about this?
Exclusion: cooling.
The active.
"Ah! I don't know
Have you seen that?
AC: Instead.
What is the recent marriage?
A physicist in the city of Rome has proven and launched by man.
not from the Chinese municipalities.
What about this?
They don't even understand what we should say: [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [
Wow, Mendyu!
But what is the bass wave of law?
What is this contamination?
It's a quote between two crazy lights that give sense to each of us what are with the five ladies.
And one is asked.
Nice to meet you?
Because when we look at all the poor tourist patients in all the cities of the world, there's no one.
(Laughter) It's essential.
Then I'll give you her name.
Let's move.
None of them.
I'm a dogma.
(Laughter) "But then, did you have your feet?"
Let's give you a totally twistical knock.
(Laughter) We started the country.
Then, the Ministry of Benicuto: do you see beautiful, OK?
(Laughter) Not really beautiful to see, Beautiful.
But let's use English Italians in a way for the whole of us.
Well, I don't like us, I don't even like nonsense, which is the thing.
It's curious, that's it.
CR: Great.
Spicry.
C: And, quiet, right?
But we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about the Italian.
But the most romantic language in the opposite world of "Roomy and you" I'm starting with Word.
The most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents.
KA: The fourth most studied language in the world and they don't study the Italian to do business, study, or because they love it.
But for the swimming pool, for fashion, for the opening.
For art, for history, for dancers.
They don't study it for that.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, become male.
And he said, "Why?"
[R] For example.
G: The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us pizza.
Here you see the map of the maps.
And if it comes to the United States, confronted with the negotiation map with the same amount of the negotiation map that sell to bug or Otdox.
Keep your chest.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Why, here, in Italy, do we drink guai?
Great!
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
Then, how do they make stories?
You can move, in the week, from the Italian wine, from the boat.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Happy and plantations that sell food and wine.
(Laughter)
Wow!
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
It's what scratches the revive magician, Italian in a way.
The "Luccorri Frendley," more "blem," directly from the passes of the Winter.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
And he said, "Mom, I ask you who told me."
A disorder.
Give it occult.
I ran as if it were a ...
It was a mountain in "Goen Kenio."
And no folks.
It's like they are in our job.
And the women we see in ours?
Don't forget mental birth.
Why "corri"?
But you see, there are no colors.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of breastfeeding medals in France and reading it.
Francese, this is the same payment in Italy, and it speaks English.
(Laughter) There are only two Italian words: the first one.
What is happening to us if the unionacaco perfectly disappeared?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's look at our radicies we love here."
And the Argentinian, this: "I join on-s."
Riuniosi.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalian, isn't it?
We are segmented.
Well, the curious thing, why?
A: Oh, Fedou is palatable!
(Laughter) Italian in two: I don't like an English word.
60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we can see it.
We have to wait for the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled with the sign, who has compiled this model of the formula, to be superior, linguistic competition.
"Your left!"
Every day, for drugs, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems model to us, because we are ortovinent.
We use a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
I: No, no.
The profoundly inserted into the thesis of the Italian language, purely, has accessal and subtle.
CR: We said colors, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I heard them say, "The bucket is the "lockering" that we chose for the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
AC: In the ufficies we can feel, we have to schedule a set of toothpaste lines joining the caste for "Satisfaction."
With business it's united.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pipo Franco and Gennaro" to put this application on the customer service, because the unit business is always a guy, blank and journalist.
(Laughter) In English, the email speaks not only in companies, but also in average, public administration.
The Govern.
(Laughter) We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that Jobset didn't have it more sympathetic.
And it is forced by Giobatt's newspapers, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
Fat.
Sensibilization activates this problem.
FdB: Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and waste, and a little bit of energy.
What about this pet?
who invented it.
Because public records, the government, the companies, the media, say it.
In Italian, and once again at the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this awareness company, we were waiting for a speech of failure, but not what happened: in less than a month they have movies, performing their names, with men of Dizzo, and in the last 70,000 people.
They have signed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spike that none of the workshops have signed up professional suppliers and have called pensioners, have signed.
It's Italian and the west.
They say, "What's burning our language and signed a story in Italy, they filmed from all over the world?"
C: From Singapore, from Jerusalem, from Pedudal, South Africa and north Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with a movement: I did it.
A: Ode.
To look at these signs that grew up, we could read the motivations.
I'd like to talk to you about someone.
Italian is a right, but also a debate: we're in the novellous mood; if we think abundantly, we talk about other tangoondly: workers in an amministration public, help.
"Film, because I've studied classic studies, "Goda the work with economists."
Later in fashion, I've received a prize of risks, it's not for the unexpected and the trends, I don't think it's going to happen.
(Laughter) An Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Sisher.
(Laughter) And we know how to lose.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Cchung, go Rome's food."
So it starts to let me decrease our language.
Because you could never say, "Senty day, it was an animal that splits that."
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
But because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, instead of visualizing them.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old, thanks for a motorcycle.
That's it.
(Laughter) I just said: an echo.
It's challenged to discharge, because mass media has trapped that which is due to zero cost.
And does not amplify it?
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the stamp on the dispubblic side, but it was taken with a great applause, a section of Italy and the welcome.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vaniti Feer talked about it, he talked about Christian family.
He spoke to me about the Mexico of Turing, he has spoken today that behind him made a publishment: azensity.
Why?
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And you've often had a great desire to laugh at each other with knowledge and consciousness of our language.
This thing was finished in the newspapers, and it also touched me.
When I got into the city, on the summit... the rhythm was taken by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, by a candle.
That's it.
But we need that.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
And we have all streams, the Italian.
And you see them richer?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is value, is a factor of more emotional.
(Laughter)
Then, it sells the spiral, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
CR: In English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten, and so who talks about how mangia?
FdB: Not the best.
And then ...
"This lady is tolerated!"
FdB: In the first of the talks of this play?
The messages that defined this sign.
S: Homo Sanzalitter.
Because he scratches in volcano, in Italian.
It's simple.
Behind, the structure, the way of decent, helps us express our creativity, the Italian language, the Italian language, if we resign to express our language.
We resign one of those pecurialities.
One of its successes.
[A.DE.]
(Laughter) Wonderful!
That's our potential.
Specifically, Italian creativity, which is the ten in your mother language.
What's more, if our linguistic status is strong and used to it, we can attach some term strange, why personality?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
With a bit of sense we must have an excess, a finalist, or a misuse.
But why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, in Italian.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
And our opening towards the world that goes through our words, in reality.
A young Karghiver.
And when does a guy look bad?
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
But if that person, even with something that doesn't happen, is your mom, obey.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom, dad, or two?
I started to see if still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a young boy in the school, like everyone was going to school, I was laughing and dreaming with my friends.
But what's behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
It's always at the beginning: if I asked you what has changed, what's the same?
I was probably part of my age telling me that I still love hair, and I changed my hair.
But what is invisible in those photos, what has led me from my mother, who you see in the center, to my adulthood, who I'm currently going through my adolescent who you see on record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called the health problem, and when one in two parents hits, and you still have a child, the teenager, they are your reference points.
It was really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of fear, fear, anger.
The sadness, love, hate that alternate, take care of it.
It's the constant feeling of walking on the shoulders.
It's an eccessive charge of responsibility.
It's the difficulty to focus.
And also the need to be in charge of doing things overnight, like breaking the thesis, or knocking frogs, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But how do we add that?
I would be able to have voices and their emergencies, for which no one has prepared you.
How to manage, but when your father or your mother saw many things that psychologists don't exist.
Or to have to do with alternating in a gold and depressive way, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, setting up, the treatments of suicide.
But as time went by, I had to continue my life as always, going to school, studying.
The reason I'm here today is that you add another character, that sometimes you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your nanny, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, it's hard for somebody to think it will be for that, or you'll probably remember the problems of parents or of debated people, hardly someone will see them, or you'll erish the same discourse.
But if I tried to say, "Hey, what about your mom or your grandmother?"
They have a great entertainment, a bipoly disorder a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Today, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us.
And this brings a way to understand what is happening inside you to your own affection, a way to ask and receive sometimes not to receive a cure.
And for you, if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that you perceive around you is the difficulty of communicating inside you, and then family, stigma, prejudice, envyment can lead you to having everything inside and not say exactly.
But loneliness, in silence, I'm a heavy musician to bring, for a wormer: How did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to be afraid, rab and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans, but that had made me grow before the others.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to pull, that no one from the school imagined.
And when the first grade started an extremely beautiful, in that wash, when the first time the light began to filter.
And I remember again with the psychologist of the family council, which is the first person left out of the family.
The one I've been able to open and that helped me, on the piano, is to see people sitting around me the strength that they could be supported.
But the truth and the "Stop A" was for me?
Later on the Internet on forms, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that had brought me to the trips.
And the stories of our children of parents with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
And you know why it happens, because of our children's stories there is no one who has lived the same things we've lived on us, but it's statistically impossible, in the world we're millions of people, and yet we've tried to see it, that there's no other who've lived the same things we've lived on us.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada.
Not only could I give a name to the emotions I had experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I had experienced, but I could also see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent side by myself, and I went to Vancouver in Canada, for the first conference I spoke about.
To meet these children, to talk to them, and it was a moment of positive or powerful potential, because their view, the pain, but also the ability to promote, to transform this pain together for a change, I've seen those positive characteristics, of resilience, empathy, courage, willing to change the scope as well as my.
The encountered me was an owner, an huge owner.
That still brings me energy, and it's an owner that I strongly visited in Italy and in Europe to help other empty features, other children forgotten to be able to take off their couches.
And the wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel alone when one amongst parents begins to suffer from a psychic disorder.
It's an immune desire that needs access to everyone, because other measures, as I can't even feel before caricating the weight of the world all on my shoulders.
And that's how we arrived today, in 2017, with other children, Italians, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association, children for other children, and it's called "Comit, PCilde, Noffmental, Parence, Fili, parents with mental disorder."
And it's a project that has started very low, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of them are here in this room now, who have grown up in this same desire, they have given us the challenge to start, for children of parents with mental disorder, and me.
This project has the annual objective of giving a family of this mini guide to all children, of parents who are not aware of their issues and are not even cured for their trouble, and we must also think that I was one of them for a period of time.
And initially, when I thought about this project, I was detailed.
I'll never make it realise, how will I do it?
But on the piano, I asked to help people around me, also to the scursionists' guides, proposing to tell them during a trip in ten minutes the story, and to find these people in the civil society who may not have experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in the change, and bring a family of the need in our own owner, to the community library.
And now we are able to reach so many regions, from the open beach, until the Sicily, at the Sardegna, we don't stop it, we want to reach them all.
Another wish we have is that, I mean, to give up the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
And the other huge desire we're realizing is that of meeting schools, talking to the students, not only the schools, but all of them, to be part of the atoms, to be front of those that are positive and negative emotions, the face of life.
Stop being obsessed, first what it is.
And it's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
Mah...
There's one thing I know.
It's one of the positive characteristics that our parents' parents have mental disorder.
It's the will to change the scope.
And that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, even thanks to you.
If this story had harassed, I was motivated.
Tell them, tell them about your friends, your colleagues.
Together, let's take the door that wasn't open for us, let's enter the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk to you about a special person.
[A.DE.]
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and I will surely play a hacker in a sense of drink and an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Four years ago, they were in a group that scratches the queue, maybe you don't say much, but it was Ubic in Blogosfera until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something that's called a reddit, becomes a millionaire from one day to another; but, honestly, they didn't take so much money or fame, they still do what they've always done to build a free and collaborative Internet.
Although with the Internet archaive and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving Tabyte and internet tables, internet capitals for Buduto, are archives of digital memory.
(Laughter) There was one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high law, that a few years ago does even exist in Wikipedia to do scioper.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 years ago, the history of computer education revolved around March's capital at 16 years old.
Aaron told her brother in a very touched moment of the documentary that was absolutely expected to see, and he had learned to learn prestigiously. She told her mother that, at some point, she was carrying out and a Aaron was two and a half years old, hanging in the segelone and had hervision on the fridge she had just attacked with her.
The calamite.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at Aaron's projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information, HIV's Internet preserve memory, at RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, that allows blogs to synchronize, creativity, so they make access to people of content, creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information.
This information is power that we just need to think of a second, we're everywhere, we're in schools, libraries, and universities.
Power information comes from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information to people mean...
It is to make a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
Aaron came to this genius which he is, this came from his cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker, not as a hut, not as a hut.
When...
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
[A.DE.]
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in this thing called Open Hux, a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many great editorials have the keys of power making scars what scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
And I said, "How come?
It's interested in this subject, scratch this thing called Open Hux, Guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy; the first ones were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
And it's supported.
The EFBAI had accepted it, an act of this genius probably didn't go to watch it.
It means that your opportunity to make Aaron an example, you want to give a small example to show all hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a set of rules.
F: Yes.
With Harwin, he's already made of a veracity and its technical persecution, for having scared hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats, and he could do it, but not in this scenario, and they've been answered informal Pharmacy attacks, up to 35 years.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
Two years later, her first to the rest.
They arrived at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it.
Because information is power.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently.
FdB: With Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure styles, people who wanted to give access to information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
Mr.C.
(Audience) Buongiorno.
You need to do this.
It's gone!
Now we need all the tickets to get out.
Without all this, how it's designed, then we have to do this.
Tantenio!
And what about it?
I've seen you a bit of prosecutive: E39 is Streetland, Streetland, Spanish, E39 is Streetland, it's Streetland of Archimade.
Let's do it!
The INES de Annambuco, in Boltra Cava and Messen, in Bachang, of Blanchepower, in Londra and Zaptadas and Zaptadas, of Mexangers, of Almones.
At the end of the last few years, this first time I love being a beautiful eternal woman is brutal an unbelievable thing.
What about Rondice?
It's essential.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
A mass spioning team, is used for...
To spy, to check, to express, but there is also another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, liberate, a full space, freedom of expression; actually, these things are equal to the same way, the Internet is too complex.
It's to be just one thing.
And aron says something important: Zappy tales depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
Well, I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
And to make the living is not something that will be, if there is one, it's what is already here.
The hell we live every day, which we form is together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and making it last and putting them inallel.
Good afternoon.
Then in 1950.
Among me with some physical bonds in the state of Losalamo.
But in I was closed, improvingly, I solved the eyes of theattoo and it dominated.
Are all here?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
He wasn't mindful, no, he had made a reason.
And in our galaxy there are hundreds of thousands of brains, most of them are closer to our Sun.
That's not the case.
The oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half.
And then, if life was in parallel.
Well, on some other planet.
Here's one of those very ancient sisters, so much earlier.
This is what we can see on Earth, in the galaxy, intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the point of view.
Technology, with millions of years of advantages, compared to us, maybe we'd already be traveling between the stars, but we've never been spotted by any of these intelligent political hypotheses.
And here's the question to close, I want to say, "Where are all how many?"
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it's been a lot more simple, it's that there's no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible: I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, how many, first or later, in life, at least, I'm always doing it as a child, when I was a little, I kept a little sky.
I was wondering if around those bright lights could be planets, about those living beings' gifts, which, perhaps in that moment, were looking at my vocation, were asking the same question I was facing anchemy.
And I truly believe that finding evidence that there is life, outside the earth, would be an evocous change for our species.
It's also for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
For so many centuries, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there is no center in the universe, a seventh and half ago, Charles Darwin, explained that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, and actually, we've just split everyone from a common antennace, and to find the scientific evidence of other abidded worlds, I believe it would be a third, a great revolution.
Perhaps even better, to the other two.
To bring.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps forward in the vocation of a possible answer: we still don't have an answer, but we are the first human beings.
This is one of the biggest characteristics of astrophysics in the last 20 years, 20 years ago, we could assume that there were other planets, hundreds of thousands of millions of planets and oceans on their surface, and this is one of the recognizes, actually, we know that many of them are finding the highest distances of our galaxy at least a planet, so we don't have any definitive evidence.
That one of these planets may be epocal for all of us: one of the questions we could ask is that many times, in fact, it's from one of these planets, because, in fact, it's built of this atmosphere, so we can see if there are the conditions, for life presence, and, perhaps, not too far away, and in the next few years, from the light line that are separated from us.
From an ocean of space, the universe is truly very big, and then I'll give you an example, a specific example: this probe, my shoulders, you to Geruno, the space framework built by humanity that has increased even more.
It's from the ground.
It has been on a quarantine years' trip, and it has reached the extreme locations of the Solar System, and it has entered the space in testing, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km later, 17 kilometers per second.
So it's a huge speed, but I mean, how much this one's going to add.
But this space probe for us to reach the closest athlete in our country, Proxima Centauri, if they travel in that direction, it would bring us 74,000 years.
It's a longer time than any citizen civil society has already existed on our planet, we could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the fastest city, in an emphasic nature.
For more than four years to do this path and the other brains are incredibly farther than that, so also to communicate on radio with other systems that would ask hundreds or thousands of years of education, the reaction of an answer.
So it's all very complicated, maybe we're not alone in the universe, but surely we're like isolated, we're sitting in a sea in a sea of green space, and then, in my opinion, there's one of the things to be present when you try to give an answer to the interrogative of wounds, which then the interrogative in reality that we all have, which is where many of us are.
And I use an example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my black hand and the tip of my left hand.
It's the transitional time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, 4 billion in the middle of the years.
Very good.
And the first forms of unicellular life, the antennas, which, in all forms of life, may have stopped on our planet, and even ourselves, these reacts are enough upright, are now part of the palm of the sinister hand.
But then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here.
But at the dust of the hand to the side there is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complied to a life of billions of cells, the animals, the tools.
The dinosaurs apologize.
FdB: Who?
At the end of the palm of the left hand, and at the beginning of the last speech, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely to the impact of a great asteroid, to space them from the land together with three quarters of living species at the moment of the planet.
And the combinations of these peoples, big ones, have been many times throughout this long history.
In life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet have been stressed.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history on the path of the evolution of life on Earth was a long, difficult, accident, governed by unbelievable events, and that so I didn't have to bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, I didn't have to bring to our comparison to Homo Sapiens.
It's the whole history of humanity.
It's at the end of an ugly: we could hide the road completely with a Lima's harp.
And this has already happened because we know it today.
That for decades of thousands of years in our planet have been with us other human species that are no longer there, like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
If one day, as I wish, we found out that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms, the first extraterrestrial ones that could be a simple battery, the pregnancy could be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence could be very significant, incurable, compared to the times of the universe. Perhaps they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they added a certain level of technological progress, to self-alimentate, or simply, to be involved with the audience.
Life had to overcome it?
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species.
Behind, from far away, let's imagine ourselves coming from another planet.
Well, if we think about them, probably in the universe, no one would ever realize that we were.
We are a very young species to face the problems that we will find in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day life.
On some other planet and maybe in a far future, far away to reach other estrellas, and then, there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in fantasy films, then the only hope to be part of it.
The problem of the claim, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive as long as possible, we feel hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, I believe that even more we have the opportunity to keep access until we reach this.
In schools, wonderful, full of consciousness, sorry for example, in a small planet that was lost in the spring of the cosmos.
KP: The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport made of Vitoria.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before, classifies, but the sport did and generates.
positivity and positive things for others?
A sport.
Maybe it's...
Then, when you believe you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 km, which later became 100, I joined two, because Centro Quattro was another flash, no, and I had already joined two, because you have an important number and you know.
It's a number that will come back much longer.
This is a long story.
What about us?
I'm the end of those 116 Chileans with all of us.
The runners, instead of running, are instead of being worried about the world.
To get the first ones, or to get the last ones?
But we were all together, after these 1006 Chilean agonies.
And the journey is the first difficulty.
But right now, during the first days, we were terrified to Windoc.
And there, at the top, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough.
The difficulties we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance.
And the petitoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number I still know: this Saturday I know is an important number.
It's an important number.
For me.
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a night cover, a cover of 15 Chileans, so it's very simple, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
But we do them during our attitudes.
But the desert is in general, the race is a bit like the metaphor of life, no, you begin to do things.
Later, the unexpected things happen in life, and even in the dark, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, or if it's time, or if it's time.
To do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the chance.
AD: You react.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
Actually, it couldn't bother.
And I couldn't bother why?
Because in this garage was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga, an important initiative to collect basic income for their lives.
Control to neuroplastics, a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, me before that experience.
And when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert, because there's wisdom, but unfortunately there are many many many many, which are still in this moment bad, so my goal was to do these 116 kilometers to earn funds to give a little hope to these children.
Very calm, in Namib's desert, in December, high demonstration, it runs at 61 grades, during the cover of 42 kilometers that we have, but there are always 60 grades, it's not like running at 7 o'clock.
I've had various problems, brains, matches, scriptions came in this way, why should we move forward?
When you run out you're alone, or almost, this was at the beginning of the second cover, a bit lighter, you get a km, so nothing dramatic.
Well, it was a cover.
Oh, well, a cover that started.
To make me think, a magnifying glass that started to appear even the seventh of the ground, the heat, right?
What's in a desert?
And the desert started and taught me so much, taught me that we often, to be ...
And we also feel during every note.
Build it, during all our work activities, of the inhabitable, right?
We feel inhabitable, we feel.
A lot.
But unfortunately, in the desert you find out that you're a punch, it's a cast, maybe where you arrive around you and I run around 15, 20 km where there's nothing.
And when you run 15, 20 km, where there's nothing at home from you.
You realize how small we are and also teaches you that things of a beautiful life.
But they are not just cellulare, or the final dress, absolutely many youths to be happy must have a cellulare at the last night.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at some point in the desert a night we went to eat and stood.
It depends on the pulmine, there was scens.
In this desert, it's going to take a sheet of paper, which means the door to this warning, and it tells us, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this wake."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, teach.
And I don't know if you know that with salary, I can make food, and I don't know if you know it, but what do I also do medicine?
He was happy for the warning: now we don't have to be happy, maybe only for the warning, it's good to be happy.
And from many other things, but it's also important, sometimes, to valuate how fortunate we are.
The anamibian desert is the desert that I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there is the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when you're here, we have it rained, you can see it on the side the gallerine, which then descend from the other side.
And as if I touched the sky, because my desert doesn't exist, doesn't want to.
So, when you know, she's high.
It's an incredible thing.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, they were still there.
S: I know who's going to admit it.
And we're already in Chile, where there's also the color of one.
It's a pack of the world here in Namibia and I did it.
(Heavy breathing) Well, yes.
Sorry, Marancan.
4 km/h, 4 km/h.
[A.DE.]
"Why am I walking full, I'm happy?"
Audience: Yes.
Thank you all that you're wearing strength.
And it's true, this is my battle.
(Music)
I said, "Dad, I don't love it.
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when the city, in this morning, talked about the small principle of my well-being and I found so many people with me who shared other than 26 people, because it was a motorbike garage.
With many contents: 96 were 96 people who had traveled with me, in the end, the last two km could also not do them.
The challenge was 104.
A long time ago, and at the beginning, a magic came true.
Then you can see them were all very humiliated during the score, because the horses...
It was "We can't ridicule."
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician seas, you can go backwards, do the other Chilean, you can go back toward.
To get to 1006.
Why the project?
The goal was to get to these childs' bells, to have the inside, the number is, always, important and recurrent, the interesting thing we do.
We arrived in the end.
It's the fundious recipe.
So he finished and achieved his goal.
On December 20th, 2016, if you take the figures, it's exactly the figures that make 116 km, or 16 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
But I wasn't very sports.
I have to move forward.
We had a captain.
But do people rifle?
And surely, it took 100 meters.
And we're already doing that.
"Ah! I don't know
That's not the case.
Look.
Besides having a wife that is enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who is already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years difference, this is the first day of school, and nothing, Riccardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first elementary.
And I don't know why Riccardo had policies in his place, Pietro Pan in Gengu, obviously he had already understood, well, the situation.
But, unfortunately, life sometimes crossed us hard things, no.
of life.
[A.DE.]
Well, it's a bit like that.
Like the corsa.
What I told you before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating epidemic, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this celebrating hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malform that we didn't know during birth.
And it has lasted hardly, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
And I said, "Oh, that's it...
But when did it look?
And when did it seem like everything went well?
February 18th.
But in 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too crazy, okay.
So ...
(Laughter) The garage is called Ran 1006 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Surely not me.
I: No, no.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
Wow!
And in these moments?
But you don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
Antonia.
(Applause) Continuing?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Continuing to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And in Riccardo, keep moving forward in life and give the chance to the other two that arrived: Emma, has never arrived on January 29th in San Pietra.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and anchus couldn't drop me, so absolutely, what did I have to do?
To start creating or improving my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say this visually, but especially from the physical point of view.
To give people strength, right?
And to be me, stronger.
So I started running the first image you see on record.
I reached the desert of Namibia, where these 16 kilometers have brought me to win this medaly, but to help many children, they also needed, and you can see the label, the symbol I have tattooed it up, and then another DNA, one year after the first marathon, the Rena, will see a beautiful one, and even get to a beautiful one.
Because it's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
And this year in November went to the Omann desert and Chileans will be 165, so here, there are many combinations, 165 Chileans completely in self-sufficience.
So they give me only the water, we can get to the end, but the desert is different, but the goal is always the editing, which is to get the money to help children and help them do better, the message so that I can do it today is an important message.
Anyone is.
The difficulties we can have.
Behind, big or pictures that are, there's always a hope for everyone, to do a lot of things.
And to move forward.
Because life is a bit like a bottle, right?
And today we are here.
And today it's 17/6 of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it.
