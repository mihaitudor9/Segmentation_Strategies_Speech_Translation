In 2016, I was given a Nobel Prize, from the National Cinglearning Forum, sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, named a little particularly, they were born at the ICIRO.
Before, the motivation of this reward was my disponibility in the face of the students and my ability to create environments of less formal data, more resilient, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
I usually enter the classroom, the first ten minutes, when the students come in and are seven.
According to Egor, my computer to speak and I put a classic music: I think this is the first step to create environments of fewer dismissing data and try to maintain high expectations of the students.
Sadly, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a methodology that uses end of quantity.
Storietelling.
At the pedagogical level, storytelling is a method based on the use of narrative to transmit knowledge to the students, and through this method, I would like to start my lesson, explaining a topic about everyone's safety, already.
Artificial intelligence.
And like all the stories that tell children, I'd like to start my story.
There was a time back.
Second World War.
1942, the UK.
Blockchain park.
One ...
Research in northern London.
There was a Trentian young man.
Alan Turing.
They have 15 schools in Cambridge.
And he had a research dot in logic, Princeton University, in America.
At that time, the guys used a special machine.
stigma.
It was a machine to write.
The digital operator of tastes, but, older than sitting on a paper.
Theedes used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense.
It was criticized.
(Applause)
Alan Turing.
It was one of the main figures in Blece Park.
And with his team?
And I built them a machine.
What can you see?
Dietro: How can we decipher?
This test is written by ATDESC.
For this invention you think the war is over with two years old.
Sharing many human beings.
Alan Turing continues after the war to make her logical richer.
And it is considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
[A.DE.]
With his Turing machine and form them the theme of the computer, even before the computer had created in practice.
In 1950, she published an article about Mind's magazine.
"Computing machine learning."
Dove proposes testing.
The question behind the testing is a necessary one.
I can use machines to think.
Who has started artificial intelligence.
Many of you have probably seen the movie of "MT juego," the game of training, I want to explain.
But are we supposed to be another person?
Keep it and use the computer.
who asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M is a worker O.
In an alternate way, the M and the speaker Office offer the answers to the person P.
(Laughter) They say that the Mapa's machine exceeds that Testituring if the person P is unable to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the worker.
This is the limiting game.
The machine must possess, must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
We must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent the knowledge to form the answers.
We must think automatically to formulate these answers.
And you must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to spot our thoughts.
The moment they get there.
Or you try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why it is said that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive and psychology issues.
According to this approach, the assignment that we can have is a fedal representation of the human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's silk.
Socrates is a man.
All men are dead.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
There are two premises, peritory.
It deduced a simple conclusion: from here the detive logic is born, according to the idea of the logic.
It's close to building deductive arts and transferred in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agencies.
A rational people, an entity.
(Laughter) You must act.
It must be adapted to this.
And you have to focus on your objectives, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
(Laughter) So Turing's test is connected to intelligent objects, making up Turing's quote can think.
Let's say, can we make a machine?
A artificial agent.
I could think.
Listen to artificial intelligence and rationality.
(Applause)
Artificial intelligence has the purpose of creating intelligent artificial entities: your phone is an integrity.
through the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological framework.
Once we have a great knowledge.
That's it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's about building intelligent and supported artificial integrity of man, it's a cycle.
(Laughter) But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you how to describe the state of artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five lessons to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtomani actors.
It's a daily basis.
Human beings.
Human beings.
In the end, we have the optimal actors.
I'd like to share with you some examples: optimal agents are those who work better than all men and can't do better.
For example, agents that resolve the Rubik cube, already with four strength in the best way, playing a sadness, think that a few years ago a child has been leading the start-up of the Rubik cube, and has resolved it in 4.73 seconds.
Do we have sovrauman agents?
What do they act better with all people?
For example, it's a game of the scenarios.
Right in the game of the scarcess.
Any year ago, the green aircraft, Gasport, was beaten by artificial people.
We humanitarian agents, who almost like all the people, for example, in the Pker Texano's game, answer to questions about soccer.
We looked at the "min".
What do they do?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities like the words grew.
Or the image classification?
Finally, we have subtle people who work on the stage of all people, examples are the classification of objects.
recognition of calligraphy, vocal recognition, translation from one language to another.
But if there's one thing that artificial agents today aren't able to do, for example, it's a disguise: we're talking about the fridge.
What's it?
Mela.
Or are we talking about the Marco of Apple Corporation?
And one thing that the agents are not able to do is to reason the ideal world in situations of uncertainty: these today are the majority of artificial intelligence in which we think that we are far from overcoming the testimony, we now see in the future.
Audience: Yes.
Making machines think.
Ray Kurzweil, a few years ago, has been introduced an element of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest sources of artificial intelligence to the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
What does Human intelligence indicate?
Now imagine a green line that indicates intelligence with an exponential call: this settlement keeps coming.
Sorry.
I'm prepared in the wall's law, for which computational compassion, for example measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, two years ago and in a quadruplication every four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010 we had to be capable of...
It makes us use this computational compassion to simulate the human brain.
I haven't seen anything.
In 2020, we would have access to a thousand dollar in this computational capacity.
In 2025, according to racial hours and hours, but we can never be able to sleep in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, will overcome the testing.
And then, in 2045 and theind moment in which technological symolarity will be.
In which machines will follow computers' intelligence and will follow a exponential walking that will radically change human intelligence.
Where the articulum works.
I was talking about the mental magazine.
Turing does not only proposes her test, but it also proposes new observations against the same test, these observations are our observations against artificial intelligence.
And a few years ago?
I was the only one who proposed an obstetration formulated with mathematical communication, I was a student at the University of Varese, I followed a thread of epistimology, deontology and ethics of computer science, along with professor Gaitano in Lanzerone Lanzerone, one of the compounds we wanted to fly was proposed.
I want to describe it in simple ends, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, symbol of smoke on the side of the equation.
So we obtain an equality of intelligence, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we let the vehicle become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story ...
(Laughter) Religmas to the initial question can machines think.
Now I'll encourage you.
With an open question.
[A.DE.]
But it really made sense to let them think.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) How many of you today have spoken about photos?
Craziness.
OK, OK, this brings me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in hand, and I've got to everybody, I'm called the Indians, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a studio that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with his own phone, which doesn't take me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed in my map, to take care of a liquid matter, I called the photos, which is the product photography and diffuse through the cell phone.
Her limit, her contradictions, her potentiality, her impact on the market, her designed and author use, but what sense can have, try to understand a contemporary that changes while we are here to discuss.
Technical consciousness that is in the production of aattoo, part of a professional photographer, still makes the difference compared to the simple gesture of a smartphones.
And how does photography cells change the forms and structures of professional photography in order to find answers to these questions I tried to face a confront?
With professionals, in fact, that for the first of ten years already opened the challenge of this new medium, I asked to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the experts of their experiments sharing images through the cellulare.
To find answers around me.
And they arrived to New York.
at the DESC of the New York Times Magazing photo shooting.
A Berlin?
In AIM security, one of the greatest achievements in the new market of Mobin Stock.
A Parigi.
In Parliament, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's put into account, and to understand how the mobile photography changes these languages.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
Look at the surface of the big community places of contemporary.
The selfie, for example, is that a selfie to be involved simply in a worldwide narcissistic delirium, like some sociologists have written with the basis of occupationality of the generation of millennials, or it can't be seen as an avocation of section, like an identified stream, as a sovere variation of the appropriation of its imagination.
To look at Scholager.
It's the financial term which has signed and still segts both our vision of the mobile.
This is my channel, Zazzi, the victim drewed by my photographic experiences, it's simply the result of a world's epidemic taste. Or, as the sociologist who lived in New York can't be led to the light of the most complex fators, of social, storical and even economical nature.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of the answers, is the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
It's called "I Revolution," applied to a story of mobile photographs, because in front of the power of images we were wired to, it seemed useful to us to draw a map, if not to find the right to understand where we are.
And how are we?
But the history of Mobile photos is short, but in a few years it has covered millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic neighborhood, used daily to communicate, testimony, to manifest ourselves, to feed a broadcasting of images that enables individuals to communicate from one angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collection monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, let's take more images of how many humans have scavended during the last century.
Look around 150 million of these images are caricature every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and distribution of images, of activity that, up to a few years ago, was a string approximately of professionals.
It became a combination of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction.
A can of evidence of our private fraction in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better.
Let's forget because we produce images.
And if the mobile photography is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that has shown strongly about the process of installed materials, work, family, coppy, are increasingly increasingly increasingly increasing, and here, there are intable spots in a universe in movement, sponsors of front to the average of the messages that harm them daily.
The phenomenon of mobile photographs seems to be the most natural expressive way, a fluid vision that is composed and decompose.
It can be based simply on the constant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where everyone, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
That the void stays the professional photographer and the difference goes between Western photos and conscious photos.
On the one hand, the facility of use of the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing for professionals the universal language.
Speaking in account of that process of democratization of photography, I started with theera Kodak and arrived at the iPhone.
On the other hand?
The use of cellulating as a recovery tool offered to professional photographs.
There are no chance in touching stories, stories, withgets.
Ancora, it's a part.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, from a speaker's orchestra, with a potentially global audience, has shown the professional photographer of his exclusive side.
As a tool and distribution of images.
The social foundation has never attacked, the economic position.
You just have to think about the role of the mobile photography and social network in the front spider.
We are trying to be a powerful tool to guide public authority and capture a source of machines and information hardly controlable from the necks. This is a picture of pensioners hunt, one shows that the "folfang" museum has dedicated to the rule of the mobile photographers in the Arab Spring.
But on the other hand,
Think about the possibility of interaction directed through the web, through Instagram, through photographers and audience, has released the photographer from the continuous landscape.
For the hands of the editor, he released the necessity of accepting a political agend, a law and editorial line from others, and not always based on journalistic priority, he has liberated it from the impossibility of reaching limited resources.
And he allows them to directly put themselves in the ranking of News, doing things.
Are you still living in real time, an example particularly interesting?
Like, for example, if the "femili photos," an Instagram accountant, founded by an American photograph, "Recute la Courniz" and devoted to conservation of the universal heritage of family photography as well as my photography and society in the 90s, or even 900.
We traveled by corporational section, like 14-15 photographers, an international space for authoral workers, products and distribution through iPhone, created by those professional and non-normal photographs, and there is a job of scaling in accantinity, in narrative, regarding a topic.
But then there are the photos, in the last years, who have been operating this tool with an authoritarian awareness?
I'm photos like never Crist Fer Brown.
Benjamin Lowi.
Hr. VIP, who have used and use smartphones in conflict territories, showing how agility and discretion of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of the enhance.
Fotographic measures that, starting with a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmking, creating a Bay Strek platform to put in contact the American soldiers in the South of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the first hand.
CR: Bread Sport, scriptive territory, of photos with hiper-performative grounds, and it did an intimate narrative system and minimum in the major Lik de Baispo.
Richarch Cirnandt, who explored the discourse and the assistance of street photographs, creating a personal exercise.
I'll admit that he did a report policeman, giving return to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempted Community to the partners around his job.
People who use it daily to build their family album, searching for a reflection on how Instagram changes the confines of our privacy, and the way we rest and keep our visual memory.
The Peter of Campo, who, through the Everest Everi Count, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal African African Africa, along with media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame.
As if Luis did, who claimed the silk of the shoulder with the cellulare, telling in the IV series, one of the oldest patrimonies of the West's history, with the most new vision method.
Or as anastasis the Lord Lind, who has photographed his successive manifesters in the sink, who is, during the proteste of Mai Dan, an old puzzled bronic, and nowadays has registered his own cellulating the moment in which the anotor of the Bronics hits and is born in the image, translating a photographic experience in a pocket, between analogy and digital, a long term, and contemporary stream.
Well, what do these photos know how to do, that we don't know how to do everything?
To keep going to the outskirts of the action, or looking for the vision of many personal vision of the evolution, avoiding more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened at reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and contact, between photographer and soggetto, to contaminate creativity the code of storytelling, designing in a big and reaching different audience.
To be a network using the connections in an innovative way.
To think about the real exercise of the world and the quality of impact.
Because anybody is the pregnant recovery tool.
However, if the photographic project is smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a coherent manner.
You can distinguish from the visive sound of the bottom that blinks your eyes.
All of this I believe still makes the difference between a photography which is: the remote of real, its reproductive bowl, its self-referent and sharing.
And a photography that, in fact, can still be a powerful cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 accidents of electric race.
50 thirds that have entered highly in our lives.
Waking away from the illusion that silence exists.
The first one.
It doesn't exist.
So also in this room, those employees, these signs, and put them home after a really stressful job magazine.
Even better, you compete with your partner, in case, and then you'll get up on your bedside in your bedera and think of being on its own, and instead not.
And there is always the law, this frequency of 50 hertz.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our houses, in our lives, but more or less that sound.
Now we have a positive side, or even better, I leave first from the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive side.
We are never alone, meaning always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Great, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a design, this frequency of 50 hectares is nothing more than a sounding circle, a sounding circle with a beautiful richer space, with which you can make music, and then I'm overwhelmed, but why?
Why would we have it so, why wouldn't we make music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound columns, a sound artist, a bit particularly, because my life is complicated, deciding to make music only and exclusively through the sound.
My parents ...
They enjoyed when I was a child.
Well ...
I know it, you may think that this is the classic strappalous history, but instead, it was the revelation of my life, so each complement of the rule wasn't anymore.
A classic complementary ofarredo, weak, immobility, cousin of voice, but becomes my musical tool.
I used to play with the other of my mother, who, at the end, didn't find her bento boxes on the other side "Mammaciao," I was looking at the streaming, and this is a big rivera.
I say, at some point,
But it will become a normal person, I mean.
So I started studying yesterday.
It's the pianoforte.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started smiling the Clarinetto, the problem Arenzo Arbore really liked, who wrote a personally ambiguous song, bringing it to the first years of studio in genius.
But I also dropped Clarinetto.
But it's good for not to leave.
I'm not the illusion of my classmates.
But I gave up all that, why did I study and escaped that rigid nation?
Because there is more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more spetric sounds in a rumor.
And I like to sponsor it.
What's the problem of life?
All of us were attacked uncomfortable.
A rumour, a failure, something that made us want, but I'm sure that the rumor made us grow much more.
There's a smile.
So here's my mission.
The end of my childhood is that of transforming a failure, a sound in music, and harmonizing everything around me.
I'd love poetry, right?
It was a great turn of dollar, Gino Paoli.
And everything would be conclusive, but no, my life was complicated in this world.
What's going on?
The Sun.
But most of all?
That's the study, and with the study, it's one of the hardest ways to understand, but it's also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful.
To bring you an emotion: our inner eye, the catalogue of the musicians, our team, reaches the maximum functional around twenty minutes of gestation.
Thirty weeks of gestation, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to hear even before watching, and this is not a case.
Because feet must be ready.
To what speteral in life, once born, it must be ready to sound texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So no, in case, if mom, during her pregnancy, listened to Pancroco Britannic, there's no need to be stupid if the child, one day, was born.
It will fall asleep listening, for example, Shakespeare.
Mothers, I'm sorry, and it's an expression I make you personally, pay attention to the musical choice, pay attention to the tongue, more than anything else, OK?
(Applause) What is it, but what is sound?
Well!
The sound is this ...
It's all that which we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what is completely astral in our lives.
You can't see, you can't touch.
Boys the son's column every day, the rhythm of our partner, the mother who scavenged us, because mom scavenged us, and not always.
All of this is the sound column of our journals.
Yeah!
Of course, the aim is much easier.
We don't know.
The aim is when we enter the current capella, let's say.
It's smaller than what you imagine.
In a small town, what else, there is a smaller one of the Militarian man?
in a small town in San Pietro.
But you're younger at home, maybe?
It captures the same as when someone saw me in video, I heard on stage, and then I meet many people, and he tells me.
I imagined higher: well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible, so.
Through this pressure, the visitor ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's try one.
Imagine our life, I would like to assume your ability to observe, then we are in vaccine.
It looks like the sea, not the case, and we start ABM.
We took pictures of our feet, our savings, our backstage, and then another prospective photo, which is also low, we don't do it, but we also make those, then there's an opening moment, so we took a drone to show us pictures: zero Chile, Chileans don't exist, I've lost it, but it's multicannal, multisensorial, but it's a multimensoryialial, but it's very proud that it had a certain point if it was, right?
Food, well!
No one dies the doll.
We photograph it.
We keep it.
Let's make a lot of video.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I show you something: when you fight with someone?
The best moment, to know the person, is to remain silent, that silence that doesn't exist among others: bahway!
Listen.
To listen and to.
Like in this moment.
Then, today I would like to bring you with me, would I like to take you with me?
Right to the world, hooing it.
your perception of listening.
And I'd like to share with you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life, born from school.
In my own.
For the first time, the school of myself: it was 2013, I wanted to extract the love of the year, a series of failures, problems and others.
Then I turned into harmony, but I sponsored to find a far away place from the adventure, here, I decided to choose.
A city of Atlantis.
I wrote the plant: yes, it's true.
There was still a lot of people, one of the most remote, culturally.
Artisticically, it's really far away from me: Shanghai, decided to participate in a competition, an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, just because I was listening for the first time.
Well, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only growing, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of the whole world, of all cities of the world, creating for us a sound colony of every city, calling this "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the city's sidewalks, the cities are a great musical tool, in order to welcome this musical instrument, you can enter the heart of the city.
I would like to take you now to Shanghai, where for 48 hours I didn't stop recording the purest sounds of the city.
And I created a sound column.
So, at this moment?
I want to swallow you.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visitor, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, they were all exposed to the visitor.
Now.
There's a city that's certain, you've been photography differently, and you've become more than once, but that smoke that fits tombs, but the bridge of Brooklyn can resonate.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional one that suffers.
Everything is completely in the leg.
and the desire to resonate with others.
I have the Concert that is truly harmful to me at a fridge and an important thing to say.
Hello.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it was on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes each day.
And maybe many of you know a couple of posts.
In this photo ...
The drop of helplessness is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, in return to a city, losing ourselves in the city, well, I knew Genova.
I used to Genova because there are captured so many times, there are volutly captured so many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that in my favorite cities, now, take the applause, I'll leave you with.
But I started to record the first sounds and the first sons gave me the data of these children that in this tube.
From iron, to the portantic, they gave me this audio camp.
And I make you feel, first of the Greek internship, and then it's worked.
Then, what is the lab?
And this is not.
Salt, to the span of...
(Bianche) Great.
And I like it a little - it seems to be a bit normal that I've never been so normal - I got attached to this beautiful fashion and it has remained a very low frequency that became a syntetizer.
His rejection.
It's in the lab.
OK, Genova is "Mr. Zandis" (Laughter) And I wasn't totally lost, that's one thing would be.
Anyway.
The writer.
As you can see, in the Junt of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical instrument, and it helped me sustain the bit of this sound colony.
It's more or less like that.
But the last speaker, after I really wanted to talk to you Genova, is that of ...
The cheap of the pork.
That we are used to look beyond, but the sound is an opposite perception of the view, and so I created this microphone.
I cry.
Inmerso, for 48 hours.
In the port of Geneva, I found a sound of a ghetto that gave me particularly a frequency that became the melody, and when it became the loop, it became the voice porting of the sound column.
This is the rock sound.
It's true.
Hello, now I want you to feel Genova Mamma.
I came to this point, "No."
Here is Genova, as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
Well, almost through our passions, in my and in your lives, and for the way people will tell you they're rumorous, stone.
For a long time, she really wants to hear her, and I thank you for listening, thank you.
As Guy Beck in Italian said in Italian, the word is usually used and restitution is not perfect, but the idea in which the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to benefit, many times, instead, the restitution is connected to restitution what you did, what you learned.
[A.DE.]
And going from the part of those who say: nothing works, then in Italy, nothing works in this country, let's approacate us, so the post a 18 minutes shared some of this story.
There was Redesi, near Segrate, and at the same year, my mother Monico organized the funeral school to pay the asylum's school: it was an activity.
Most of the time I faced these extraordinary, very heavy, done with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we need to help, we need to think about the common side."
To help astronomy, to help the community.
But it has taken a billion 200,000 to read, because it doesn't remember, it's 600 euro, then, and it was an extra effort of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later we transfer to the United States, this time is...
Similar, the same school as a school in the middle school is involved, and this is the biggest son.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we explain that it is a totally ordinary reality.
That is the "giveback" of reproduction is quite normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a manipulation of Italian parents is ordinary for the whole of society, not that the American society is perfect.
Another thing: I said this to the restitution, I was lucky, I became a member of the school.
Through the university, through the museum, along the theaters, there are all the communities that can sustain voluntarily live with restitution of volunteers, not that we don't have an inspiration, because here it's a phenomenon and a positive circle; then there are also the mechanisms, there is physical luciity, there are the processes, it works, it's not based on this.
I've been working for ten years, and some of you might have met him, this is the son's lunch.
It's supported by the famous Obamaker, who says, "Desistemis Done is the moment."
Bravs are performing very actively, and they ask, "System is one of the time."
Obama has a famous bankership and has been an incredible technological debt.
They build a study that doesn't work so many millions of situations, and this is the standard response they got, soon, critical doesn't end up for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal, by trying to do and help, which is extraordinary, and we isn't common thing.
This is Time Magazine's quote.
Most likely, many would have criticized: Google, surely, with its own interests in this, regaining the technological resources sent by Google, the other companies, there are fert, and agree with the white house, have recharged the freedom, resembles in a few weeks, at one decim of the costs.
The extraordinary effort, not the ordinary, I've seen that I finished the TAMEG coverage without very interesting time, and that's what...
I'd like to explain to you about what it was like, the spirit of people, and not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to repeat the experiences they had filled with their lives.
In this case?
They have the ability to manage growths, technological systems, complex processes, scalible.
Repetible?
And make them again reproduce and scarce.
It's creating a replicable system that is the "YOS Digital Service," from this strength, it has been born.
A replicable system, what we hope to do as well: I want to suffer with the word models, the ones that have taught you perseverance, the desire to never change, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to rest.
But, for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also in Italy.
Almost 20 years from space.
The idea of returning, helping, was also because they're Italian.
"Yes."
I wanted to do it: dumb, dry, right?
To work or not to do, there is no attempt, maybe the Italian religion is to do or not do, there's no point only to criticize.
Audience: Yes.
Any year later, we're five to discontro-materence without Francisco, and he came in a massive medium, in Silicon Valley, he raises awareness of the need for transformation in general, to those things that have enabled us to a little less.
The transformation that must also be transformed into the transformation of the processes, in the digital transformation of public recording public, asked me why he couldn't help us during an year's trip for a couple of years: I think, we reflected, the packaging with my wife, Monica, and talking to my capo, Jerpeso, in order to make it short, I decided to apply a methodology of appropriation and I couldn't, or I couldn't, or I can't, or I can't, or I push myself, or I try to apply for two years in Rome.
A welcome...
- Oh, manzone.
But those who do it as an Amazon, a robot, you know, but from something you'll underwater, these are only many slums, I have to say that we've got so much supportion, so in this moment we're focusing on this part, but at the positive side there was, there was, I'd mentally focus on the opticism and bureaucracy, but also the aspet of these disguises, and of course I didn't expect, of course.
But authenticism is not often about sexism, which has reminded you of certain mentality, you never see it, obviously you do it because you have your bosses, I feel many of this kind, and in this country, in truth, there is a lot of sense of common good.
It's about doing things because you think of helping, improving a situation not only because it's interested.
And here is here, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the older people recognize it, as a mega businessman, I say this because it's the brutal title, my children, I've traveled, straight away from the start, of an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allows me to assume some people from the paper of the administration.
The only thing I asked you here is: since the systems from the inside don't turn into each other, we want to try to transform them with people outside, where the fact that we don't know public administration is a sign, not a reliability, it's an advantage and not an advantage, so there's also 25 people, a number.
Not big, but neither too small, of technological expectations around 80 percent, 20% are expected to perform judicies, legals, governors, and communication.
Here you see the post I've done when I only entered this adventure, I said, because we don't write what we think will happen.
In this way we want to attribute such, caritent people who live in Italy, or who want to make us, even temporary, to a compound, probably much better than what you see, as I invite you.
So I got into this idea, but how can I invite somebody to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other reason, maybe some of you recognize it, that closed photography of Belgium, which in 1997 has spoken to all the United States, who has given the phone's children, all the United States, in this massive sport, in terms of investments and infrastructure?
But we have created the vision.
The country operational system, a series of fundamental components, can be built more simple, efficient for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
The most beautiful vision in documentation is lacrime and blood.
I have continued in my place: field of warmth in salt, but that American future, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, there will also be many complicated rules, such unpleasantvoltaic, it's an easy prediction: we had to learn how to manage with intelligence the bureaucracy, many of you will say, it doesn't understand how public recording works, they've already proved in many, in Italy, it doesn't work.
And I continue.
But we will receive many criticisms, some comments will be sincerely useful, others will be kinds and prejudices, the critics of the first type riding people who really want to offer sponsorships to their contribution and we treat many of them.
But the second guy, among those who want to defend the status quo, is that they always see the animal being a fence.
Or that they are simply reflected in helplessness.
And this is our problem: to motivate things that don't work.
[A.DE.]
You can imagine this picture: the first, men and women in the Times magazine cover.
Here's it.
So, although he tried to memorize the most possible agent of the eye, I got around 3,000 questions, and now we became a bit more, and he immediately started to work: What do we do?
In fact, we deal with "draulics."
These are the tubes of public administration, some of us can connect, because the big problem is that systems, processes, applications, whatever they should be interconnected, it's silos that they don't know.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their data, their own soffers, their own applications, so it's about introducing this, writing it, explaining it, and in years, implementing it, of the connectivity of production, so much idraulic activity.
But we can't also have the choice: to make the flames in time, we have to make them improve the authentic interface, doing more simple things, all these things are made in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the breast.
(Audience): Yes.
After a few months, at the period of 2017 we said, "The Spanish piano, public administration, we did together with the help, other people who helped us," what is mainly the trenal piano for digital transformation in my situation, and particularly there is one thing, there is.
Two things are written in a clear, technological way, but also in a process.
The first time it was...
According and sponsorized by the government, the Gentiloni Pole affirmed the decreto of the present as minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the formal element riches a team game to simplify amministration public, the city's life, particularly of the piano.
It's been newspaper once in the year, because the kids couldn't have been, there are mainly technology.
And it's appreciated to ministers.
(Laughter) What is this, is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in public management?
The rules are reversed with technological rules and will likely meet three pains of visits and connections to other floors on the other side, and at some point the technological rules are quite incomprehensible: unfortunately, we can't talk to the administrators themselves, the technological ones they understand.
Let's change it.
[A.DE.]
We dedicate ourselves in this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano to competitive platforms, digital platforms, the digital payments, are those things that abilitate in spontaneously all the activities of the recording public, and the more they will be.
Digital payment is one: Digital payment, electronic maps, an appointment, digital identity is a platform.
The professional project that we have followed now is called national anagraphy and resident population.
"Yeah."
That way, by technologically banking all the data of your citizens that at this time are around 8,000 different silences, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in a large amount of data, synchronize, where the data is talked about them, are all synchronized and they talk about the rest of complications, from a community to the other side, I must.
First of all, what I manage nowadays, then I must, citizens, go to the association, motorization, all those posts, I should say, all those things I've already had to know about.
We're resolving technological solution, and then we'll do so much about the processes.
Two weeks ago and a week ago we made an Akaton.
Among the 800 software developers have worked on that application of abilities, they have used in 96 interventions, bug-fixing, so to put these problems of software in a world.
A improvement of documentation and even new projects: all this conflict that we're talking about sustainability and replicability of the beautiful concept of technological viewpoint, like from the University, was built in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, although it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us, well, you, where you've got married, all documentary, all the code, but each and more, the applications.
This is Italian administration, now there will be a fifth of what it should be, maybe even less.
The future is today, let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that basically don't get limited to make an iraulic, I also entered ball as well.
But it serves that the bubbles are composed, synthesize me, and this might be, for example, one of those things that will increase the alsa version, alpha, it's called digital citizenship, the phone, the smartphone, has the electronic identity, Nepsiere.
It's already functional, and all this is the aim of making it easier, familiarizing the interaction of citizens and public administration.
With a simple interface: we're dreaming a little, because work doesn't really make it so much, but it's in this vision.
Few a few weeks ago, the stamp.
With the next 150 years they wrote an uncertainty in the world that ...
We waited, asked many people ...
Talking about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the life of every day of citizens, I took the chance to write an article I want to cite you.
Some fish?
It's a dream, maybe we do it, we wish a country where politicians who try to understand digital transformation, instead of fearing them and fighting them, they're the regulation in not ejecution.
Behind, a country where reading recognizes and promotes the right to innovate, hoping to embrace it.
A country wants to offer technological competitions that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies, guided by 30 years than by 70 years.
Imagine in a country where to work for public administration is an wealthy, where the best humans do to work in public research centers, that are green and proper centers of eccellence and innovation.
That leads development to the country, to make it a dream come true.
And that the components to do all this digital process policies, technological processes are really many and maybe too many, but if it's not a dream about which we can hardly be able to do things.
Let's conclude.
(Laughter) This is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Bacchitana has made it."
And here, somewhere in this theater among the other, at this point, but it's more calm, in a site I managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks it like us, like Till, like the 25 kids of the Tini Times to become Digital, has understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our dream is our social, thanks.
And what if I had the chance to make a wish?
You only need to change a aspect of your life that will not be like you.
What would you change?
And you, what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your own boss and your employees?
(Laughter) I was sure that I wouldn't have trapped anybody, or maybe you won in muscles, maybe you lose some thread, you're afraid, you're looking at you Ever that "Eh", because here behind I know there is, then raise your hand those who would change something about your body, maybe you'll be one of those who will change partner.
(Laughter) Many times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
We didn't understand if I took part, and the answer was different because the elementary school supposedly would have a more united family, but my parents were separated.
(Audience) Yes.
To the fears, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, to pleasure more to the kids.
(Laughter) Being the university, I would have wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the market and work, and the first part of my life, I spent it fighting and letting to try to understand how to change things that didn't belong to me, the other people thought of me to the great economical sides, of interpersonal relationships, when I was a psychologist.
But I financed my research also to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if you use a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but since most of the cases were the only three posters to play in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a good thing, but they ended up living their problem.
The strategy, today, the broadcast, is to get lamented, we get lamented a little of all, there's crisis that there's no job, there's traffic, that makes fun, that I'd have done it differently, we regret because there's no police, and it paralyzes, it's hypnotized and lightened at home.
(Laughter) I remember a young girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else to get bothered, from when I started to talk, and then from the youngest to whom she translated her, so she didn't have a job, a capability, and you can see that her mind was completely colonized all her daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a little the great temptation, because with a small effort you can obtain a great result, to remove the rule of the victim, which is listened, comforted, helped.
(Laughter) Anyway.
Can you feel sorry at night or at day?
Da alone or with friends, at a high voice or in your mind, you can remember something that is already suited or something that might happen one day.
And you can lie to your tea, or as much more often as it happens, you can lie to yourself on the right.
And because all of us would have so many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
(Laughter) But the truth is that as much as you're forced to regret it hardly something around you will change, but you don't have anything else to pay more attention to what's in fasting.
Another very exciting strategy, when things are constantly stretching, is that of lamenting budgets that someone is at the studio of a B piano B to save your hair from the top to the magnifying glass.
(Laughter) In the basis of this mentality there is a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't okay is enough to change it, we can manipulate our well-being what surrounds us, don't you like bearing?
But from those who are skeptical noises?
Then, you feel a bit dirty, but why can you never be suffering, take two pillars and solve it easy?
The wife breaks you, divorces you.
In the fresh lights we can all know how much rising it is.
And your child doesn't listen to you, please.
It's too big not to take it up, send it to the psychologist: we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, to make the world around you enter the perfection with your agencies.
But the conting, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, is the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a coppy, during which I'm doing another thing, that listening to what, according to the other, would have to change to solve the wounds of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
It's certain that you can conceive yourself, but you can't even prepare yourself in a grade, which is a classicone, and it, right?
If you who never asked me if not for that, and he doesn't, you know that you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, no, if you who didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do another way to get me uncontrol, and that's how, in the end, a strong iron-looring arm that always starts with the same stream word.
And because we must show all the equity of the other, we must make them see all the problems that should be there to restrict our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if we know what we say often in good feet, believing deeply.
We can hardly change something, old, but instead of giving up the odds to the base of the relationship, we try to irrigate them, to apply them, if the strategy that privileges, when things are not as you are, that of imported your need and hope that others are modified as a consequence.
Think of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's to make sure there's no way a tool to take the forehead, put it under the ground.
But at the base of this dynamic, many times, there is the pleasure of facing the inability that emerged, then we should show our needs, and then what do we do, do we suffer them for common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live at the merece of external needs.
AC: I remember a young and young man, the son of separated parents, often close to the roof that the time was openly driven in confronts of someone would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned some important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to reason about the motivations between them, even distant from one another, but on the other, I never learned to say no to the things they didn't care about, I didn't learn to say no to the things they didn't care about, and the need to count how many.
It's the strategy that privileges when things don't go as you are, it's that of suffering your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you and instead of telling you all how many, you'll finish to disrupt them.
(Laughter) Sading, involving your needs or hanging them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say it with a cause cognition, because I myself in the middle of my meditation, has abused, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, primary of the spedal he was working on, he sent me to call and said to me, "If I'd like to keep complaints with us, you should accept a transfer, but there was no room for her, and he showed me a far away place to do a job, and there wasn't even a big deal with all that I had studied until then."
I've heard about dying, OK, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change ideas, adopted, but I sent that other, and even worse, because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbelievable to me.
I learned that...
To get different results, I had to do things differently.
For the first time, of course, on my feet, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing oneself, if I changed.
Also the others would have to keep on, change, change.
It wouldn't take me much more than that, if I turned into a super brilliant psychologist, competent, complete, unknown, unicorn, primary school wouldn't have sent me a way, and if I hadn't done it, but perhaps I would have gone by me even before the immigration.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer wasn't in the hill of others, but I had to ask my responsibility profound.
But why are things?
They don't change.
Behind, we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
He goes to the agreement of choosing us.
And choose you.
What's the cause of things?
that they don't leave as a path.
Receive yourself as a cause of things that are not going to happen.
This is our challenge.
But if you haven't ever had a job in the crisis, you're throwing the units at your disposal.
I'll never find myself alone and help face something much bigger: I want to say, you open your doors in front of you, because it defends your responsibility, the gend, you can always decide to speak a new language, read books, go to courses to acquire new abilities, or consolidate those you've already had, it's the basis of the crisis, what you're going to do, but if instead of you, and you think you're perfect, that maybe you have a bank to change a journal.
But because life is from those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
It builds it.
(Laughter) If inside the coppy, things don't go well, you think it's the other side to where to take the first step.
It is sending them a message of inadequity and you're spreading it, if you're part of you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today to make your best newspaper, then things change, but they don't change in the case, but they change because you know you've changed the first task of your needs.
Now you see the research of your needs, and then try to operate, to be able to satisfy them.
And in this way you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other, instead of making the war, if you are one of those people.
They are all over the world, and they always have to say yes, one of those people I call forgive me in the end, the national prostitution, is clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose a sense and meaning the things you do.
If you are part of yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand what actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside of which you can become a standard of the table.
It's starting to work on me, considering the cause of things that weren't working like I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to warn to be a better person.
When I was writing to university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my subject there were practical, concrete tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value to their lives.
But, my friends, I met a couple of ...
With problems, stereotypes, prejudices, Jobs are the doctor of the matters, psychologists are the doctor of the debts, but they had to talk to a friend, but they went to the bar, but what would I have to do?
But I'd have to lament, or maybe you don't consider how beautiful psychology would have to try to change their mental priorities, I'd have to drop my dream: no, I had to.
Instead of having mine.
It's the turn of ...
Little time, following this instruction, I got the results in unimaginable things.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and her proposal of transference, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do?
I thought about it, and after all, I decided.
I had accepted the transfer.
But not how he intended him.
I've handed here.
I went home, stood the computer, and I recorded a video that I've caricatured on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here in the hammer of capabilities, of collecting anatomy, because maybe they were...
In the turn of a short time, my YouTube channels became a reference point in Italy, for the issue of video psychology, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people get closer to psychology getting in discussion some of the stereotypes that happened to you before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm from 1979, published psychology in Italy, my magazine, and what left me more than anything was recognized that the bonds at the beginning a bit of strangers came back.
It makes me leave.
Because, obviously, you've seen that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something to do with that, and in Lumbi, I was read to the Vice President of Ornesi College: the dreams.
But don't become real, why?
For example, fortunately, or why did you have had that?
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps you hold and makes you move forward, the ones who don't know how to build and need to reflect, because the culprit should do it.
And you should also start discussing your identity and your partners' points, your certainties, your many possibilities of always, an internal way.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but the most urgent one.
We must adapt to our internal circle.
For this reason, I've asked you a question: if you have the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't work like you?
What would you change, we talked about work, physical action, and the current conting?
Well, in childhood, I'd like to leave you with a gift, the less proved, it's a small question that I personally was very useful, and that is based on logic that in order to produce great changes, it's about concentrating in so many actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And it's easier.
What are you going to do until now, at the end of the store, with the marriage in case after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life into the direct?
Who has auspiciated.
You can think: Which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life into the directions that are both?
CD.
"Oh, are you joking about the rubbish, what do I send?"
The ugly to the back, left the pulm, made my house where I put the package?
Fedemma, the protests are the providers.
I hold my hand, I steal the leg.
Or on her feet, which is now about mutating?
Oh, ugly, it was when my mother came.
But do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to speak for eight minutes.
What about me?
I want this time to take it by myself, here.
I had a dream.
to create a integration band.
One of diverse and different abilities.
And the percussions are so fast, so immediately, they take up the distances and join the battles.
Are we partners?
We are part of the sets.
Six kids, I see them, I see, mature, fear, my fears, I saw them growing.
And our provides were the mariday, the mariday was the day of proceed, where this room was entered at the Andreoli School.
(Laughter) They were picking the first bidonies, they were together, the first split together.
Then we decided to become part of the band.
KP: From there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to take the first musical notes and saw the first ones, the first weddings in the groups, the first satisfaction, the first meetings.
The first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for all we were doing.
But most of all the first applause.
Unfortunately, one night from the 20th of July 2012, the beloved world crossed.
It's in the real sense of the word.
All of the cases were completely inagible or crossed: a strong earthquake that filled our land.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of thousands.
For all the gusts we called this.
And as I said, the cases were ...
No more accessible.
Many believe that our living provides, our place where all marriages were completely different.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sara, Marco, ugly, Matteo, and we tried them all.
You have endless and rolls.
We've done it.
Luckily, we all found them.
[A.DE.]
We're all finished inside a stone, in a stone in the seed of demonstrations, of thousands, inside that tunnel.
There were magnificent things.
And we've been feeling fearing stronger.
Because the books were the strongest in the earthquake, it kept us in the eyes.
With the Earth that washed, to find a smile, a look.
It's the Earth shaking.
I'm there.
We built the first tools.
The surname of sci-fi.
I have become the advertising categories.
of the tubophons that have become?
The tools built and combined with ping pong roots, to take off with big ones and if you cross.
We were constantly.
In the continuous washing, there was always an incredible energy.
Although we were in a terrible moment.
[A.DE.]
Already there is born our first spettacol.
We decided to put in a true spettacol.
However, the components of the group were increasing, the friends used to say 20 we stayed, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are starting with the construction of the first spettacol: white people.
Because it's the white man, because there were the younger men, the younger men and the white man.
At that moment, everyone moved together.
Like a white of magnifying glasses.
Afterwards, afterwards?
Do we do it?
Last year, we did another spettacol, the curve.
We became all marineal.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And we will also display a moment from our land.
to breathe for a moment.
After the year, we cracked, this marine show, immediately afterwards.
50 orphants, this flying brow?
And to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stand a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tender.
And no one of us would have ever thought that a stone could change our lives, but we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems a change.
(Audience): Yes.
150 concerts in return to education.
The stage of the first building.
The concerts on TV program at a friend's house.
And the kindergarten stage?
And we really did a lot.
And also for me, the divisions go down, because that's exactly what I'm doing.
It's exactly the circumstances of life, that of fatigue, of sudden, but also of freshness, that has so many possibilities and future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
And now I have to go back to the soft guys: do you expect me?
What is there still so much?
And to build, thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
I'm my name Maria Cristina Firadini, and I'm actually born as a researcher, until I realized what has happened in the last 250 years.
250, very important years that changed our history radically, and that we live nowadays, we talk about social innovation and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And most importantly, our Italy, which is often as biased, is a country ready to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be used around innovative.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution, the internet revolution. However, these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new era, that we have, somehow, storically, bathed arbitrary, in the 2000s that we're living today, and the computer seeks to understand what happened in these 250 years.
Why is it what we've studied?
The school book, in fact, was not only an iron: we, at the Industrial Revolution, we are huge debates, usually advertising debates, for example, because we need the vehicle to save.
And the vaporean motor is not only a vapore mask, but it is, for example, the tool that has favored and resembles much faster, the carbon estation and the rising possible to a significantly lower cost, and the possible risk is an increasingly lower cost, and it started to change the modality, but it didn't make it.
With motorcycle, we don't only need the vaporean motorcycle, we also need the aircraft engine, because, by the way, it's a Toscanan invitation and an Italian invention.
We need, for example, the automobility industry.
Actually, it was used in the industrial industry, because motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't go from far away, when I was able to understand how to get that belt to get it as well as dumb and welcome with the belt that developed the automobility industry, and all that has been derived.
But not just that.
And in the Industrial Revolution we are still debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us to avoid, to continue to spot our letters, and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to another of the world that is always smaller than we knew.
But it's also what permits us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
Sottile sea.
And yes, as you can see the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, we interrupted everything.
No, if I've been going forward, I've had caves under the sea, the first cave to give a storic dimension was taken from various cities between Mexico and artists to the abbia, not just two people who agree, but the first cavity was joined there.
And we are around 1858.
But that's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it is, we use it, transports our voice, in 187900 beloved to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first continental electric power in Europe was built by Santa Radagonda, where Rinascente Milano is.
Today, there's the equivalent: a time in 1873 was replaced by the first electric power plant, in that year 30th December, the scale was illuminated.
And a part of our history has swimmed my I.
The founders who, in the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stance like this, and had functions of marriage, are the computer that are sidewalks, but started to be born something, compared to something that had never been in the first history, and they had simply fasted the glass.
But they went on and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, always more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know, at some point, they decided to open these responses.
And these responses, which were called arpae, arpanete, the network, became, they began to be, the World Web, which we know, a system diffused, orcular, non-chemical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information to gather information to generate information, were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the orders of tens of billions, because we're not only talking about computers that we use, but of all those intelligent systems that are connected to the network to record data, to collect data or to work on data.
But when the functional strength, which was replaced, which was introduced by the industrial revolution, started to disrupt artificial intelligence of the computer.
And mobility?
That's a industrial process that tells us that what's new, progressively, does what's old, because we've lived now, that we're living now, but a story that is a little more complex, that belongs to us a little more and on which it causes us to reflect, to accompany them.
It was 1863 when, from the scale, it wasn't the Italian yet.
Minister Minghetti, provided in entrance exams, establishes that the 27th century of the doctor, is exposed, the payment is public dependencies.
And from 27 of the successive months later, this happened.
And in this moment, even if we don't get into it, we're introducing small ministers, I'm introducing something extraordinary: first, the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce goods that were necessary in their surroundings.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky from the stages, less risky from the sanitation, started somehow far from the land.
And most of all, it has transformed the economic power of the power of production of goods and goods in the power of producing a good, the dense.
But there is a second expectation, which is frigerator, and that it's not only that object that frees us from the urgency to go and sponsor every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to keep in mass media, in structured way, in a healthy way, in the quantity of food, which is the frigerator.
So, there is also the chance, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the emergence of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live towards the end of the November, these are us.
At the time, as we said, computers arrived and the Internet came, and then there's a number that has characterized these years, which is a element that we can define as the qualifier of these years, the speed, the speed of movements, the speed of our movement, and we move fast, and the speed of our thinking, which is not a detail of the idea, but we are very fast.
And until when something happened, typically it's close when you keep the story of understanding the messages from one seventh to another and sharing some date that aren't necessarily 0.900 to900 to 2001, because, above all, I believe, but this is truly an orbitrary belief.
And the American economy started to slow down, the other one went to Torri Gemelli, and so something, in the balance, started to change, these balances that seemed lonely, we were very fragile.
But we move forward until there was something that happened normally, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world and the Western world could never meet, there wasn't only America to slow down, almost closed, there was also the Orient.
Instead, there were Europeans who were to fail, the barrier is already the release of failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, it has changed something, but what has changed, has changed the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
But let's not wait for the biggest economic crisis, which was indeed verified in 2008; it was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis in this dimension, when we can do all?
With many fewer people.
It was obvious that it would be left: we were certain, and we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are credible multinationals in most of them, but above all, they are all the companies that came after 2011, what did they buy soldiers to travel, learn, learn?
The diverse way, the most efficient way.
We tried to look at the health of digital tales, according to five factors, the connectivity, we are ten percentage below the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection between 50 seconds.
Anything, according to human abilities, human resources, abilities to heal, to a distant being, to abilities based on what allows us to develop them, a third factor that we must look at, the use of the Internet.
But a third, a fourth element, is the inclusion of digital factors in productive processes.
So, trade, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
In reality, there is a very profound change that is going round the European countries, and this doesn't want to notice: the use of the Internet, frankly, we're just a few seconds, but, apparently, it's enough to look at the journeys and see that they're growing fast, there are new barriers for our future of countries, and there are the abilities and the digital inclusion in terms.
And in this way we have to be very careful about the characteristics of our country, we have two engines: the first motorcycle.
It's what's done greatly in the '50s and the pictures of the walls.
They're starting to do something extraordinary, "Made in Italy," and they're not part of the biggest multinational companies. Actually, they're likely the most efficient entrepreneurship tool to interpret the speed of change, they're agile, they're speeds, they're pictures, and they're quite united in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to insistently acquire abilities inside this reality, because these reality can become those multinationals that can serve, a lot of market segment, in an extraordinary way, generating resources for all the thesis around you, a cultural artistic heritage.
But can tourists only visit three cities?
Venezuela, RA and then Remember, I believe this is your great achievement that we can recover, to include this patrimony within a knowledge system that allows us to bring it and make it black, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but also to visit all our country.
The reason I spoke about, in a certain sense, is the opposite of the word that unites all this.
Our discomfort is the opposite of the word "share" because I'm not talking about sharing, but in a certain sense the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'm going to talk about inequality, how do I want to start in a new way?
But I believe that most of you have increased, if then, perhaps, some journalists might have added the pre-scientific aggressive way, they have increased exponentially, but, according to you, in the last, perhaps, the answer of many would be.
I've been asking these questions for the last years and with the sole ventscator and video functions, I've prepared with my colleagues a report on inequality, from when they are data, which is to support from 1960 to the highest majority of countries in the world.
[A.DE.]
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the abandonment of inequality in the world citizens, as you can see, there was an increase in inequality, especially in the 1980s, but from the end of the year 1990s, at the end of the 90's, precipited, now we are at the storic mining.
In Italy, due to inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase over the 1980s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republican Republic.
(Laughter) We have a rather decreasing inequality tendency.
How can we read these data?
Behind, a possible letture is to say: we've undertaken an architectural support, because we've continued to talk about years of increase of inequality in how data can't support our feelings.
We talk, the feeling wasn't wrong, but maybe the idea of inequality in which...
(Laughter) We rag.
Maybe we need to reflect on the reasons of inequality, what we intend, about inequality, perhaps the concept of inequality requires some repetition.
We leave time to assess this question and let's move around a century.
And we also moved to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the crisis of 29: Lickens.
The first one says: a speech proposed in front of a public of students, a speech, which was then famous as the title "possibility economical" for our grandchildren.
And in a seventh grade, the company of a worker will be...
And he saw a problem for that, because the question Keynesse was also requested with a huge amount of here in little, in other words, in about 100 years, that even 10, 12 times, in some cases, 15 times, this teacher was developed, but with all this time they wanted to know how to use it well, or not.
Apparently, your second feature didn't become true.
Because we see it all, that we don't all work, it's certainly false, but the first time we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day: we're sure that it's not made anywhere, we'll see those succession in Italy.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
The interesting thing is that these 16% an Italian and a half devoted his work throughout his life to work, two or a four hours a day, that is, the three-hour neighborhood, in Italy, we already installed it.
Naturally, if this happened, there are reasons also for the last year, from 19900; there is another reason, which is also very positive, and other bananas, if you want your windows and if you want a banal, for example, the anger is enormously aligned, because we die a lot after our time quote.
It was dedicated to work and crooked.
And it's the flash of the occupation taste, that is, the number of people who wash.
This is the storic series of the total occupation rate.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic storage series, because it makes you see that...
In the beginning of the century, in the whole monarchical Education, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even more frequently over 70 per centuries, today we are very low, we are around 50 percent.
But a rate of occupation goes down to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that not the people who work, that is, the consumers who don't perceive any income are more than workers.
In front of this?
A storage action: we can also have a relationship.
But then we see if in the country that modernity emblem, in the United States, things have gone the same way, because if this interpretation is true, it should have happened in the United States, in Italy.
And there were conflicts: this is the storic series of time.
I've dedicated it to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only goes to the '30s and then it's established, but there's a third tendency to the argument, while we don't believe it, but it's even more impressive, and the storage number of the management rate, because here we see.
Which may have an increase, what you see underneath is the crisis of 29: we have a general assistance in the USA to the USA, in our case, we have a situation of resolution.
at the occupation rate.
(Laughter) But then, this idea of art is a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why?
Behind, there are more people who consume without producing that the people who produce.
It's not normal that most of the population lives in a sentence that I defined as parassitary dependency, dependence, because depending on Twisia network - this can also be a family member or State - but sympathetic because I consume or the available edit without working.
If you wanted to have an idea of how theater's behavior behaves, when I found these results, we went to the scene and I asked them, "You're going to represent this situation with an image, a situation of pharassitary dependence, and you're going to be a buffag, some say buffaga, or here?"
But the buffag, or the buffag on the hypothms, or on the other great mammals, these murderers also live on the rhythm, on the buffs, we have this film that will interest us for a second.
The animals, these murderers.
As they live, if the hamster capture the ears that he or she may mean that he's playing or that he's harmful of the hell, but I'm not an etologist, I'm doing what's happening in nature, and that everything that hers on the golfly dorsis gives it, that the hamster gives, that they're injection.
And how we can define a situation like this, how we define a society where there is this kind of unconductive consumption, the first one there I said to myself, but this is the signural society, it's a minority of producers, how we define a society where there is a majority of pure consumers, but naturally it's not enough, we must add a qualification.
That it can be defined by signal society, but a mass feminine society.
And here the rapping is clear, it's a relationship of eating and submission: in the signorian society, Greego Dubezson, a great anthropologist, psychologist, the illusion defined a relationship of doppio legs, we can see why, doppy legs, because girls, because simple societies, things are a little more complicated, and signals have become a lot.
The relationship?
The buffaco with the hypothomo is of parasitism, and this is a green advantage, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food located on the therapy.
And also from the view of the producers, we saw again a green friction, a green light, the Epopopopotent is autonomous, it doesn't need buffer, but it's somehow in a report of obligation, like we are, in terms of chlorine that live on our roles, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of chronomy links.
That it's not okay.
It's a situation in which?
And the position of the adventure, in this situation of inequality in access to work, is dramatic: access to work, and very asmetrical in our social system, with the United States in the middle of the middle, there is a new problem of inequality, that is to calculate a coherent coherent of cooking that the vehicle that measures the environment, has a job that has two labs.
They need us to become an Ox country, normally, 7 million jobs.
As we arrived at this, this is the history of the inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured to the efficient decent, you can see a fascinating thing that inequality is the worst for the working positions in more, our families.
(Laughter) But here I concluded that there would be 1,000 or a month, and in addition, we'd have 12,000 euro income approximately for more than a year, and our state would have 15 billion euros to spend, as much as the sanity and the massive school together, more or less in Italy, there is one but.
[A.DE.]
We have the scholarship to write in the first art of the Constitution, which is a democratic republic based on work, we are the only country.
Who has this in the first articulum of Costitution, and we are the Netherlands of the West.
The 7 million possessions for which, and we believe, because, in this way, things seem like a BEFA.
Thank you.
