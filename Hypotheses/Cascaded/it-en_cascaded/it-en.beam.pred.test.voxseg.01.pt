Controlated.
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what these two words have to do apparently so far away: you must know that, until some time, there are my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to fall asleep they chose two words, and me on those two words I have to tell a story.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
But the words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, there was a little girl called Teresa de Calcuta.
And this little girl says, "Daddy, when?
One day I'll wait for a child, what happens?
Not to be afraid.
It's so much that everyone around Mrs. Teresa, but what beautiful word of freedom, instead...
The child thought, "I'm not.
It wasn't interested.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble, but the wish of this young man to try the writes he wrote, the potatoes were too big, and he didn't think about it, salty gradually of the psychoanalyst, and said, "Salva todo, they're an informatical engineer, you think they're so brave in the internet that my first words were just web!
(Laughter) That's how people stayed there, and he was happy because the words used, fluid, in the air.
It was succincting a magic, it was succincting something exceptional, but the most beautiful thing.
That this young man, at that time, was that people didn't laugh more than him, but they'd laugh with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, "This is a bit the problem of having the Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen, in other words, they took out the best of themselves.
And then I worked with people, all the people I met, who became part of my life, took out the best part, who became a volunteer at a house that gave people with disabilities, or actually worked the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can fear a little, or being a parent, but for those who are a genius, generating disability.
Well, that's the biggest one of the pictures, and then the scene changes: a prosthesis makes us command in a very small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only one s√°bado, and makes my wife command.
Take the paper and read trisomy 21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
A: Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) the doctor, and subsequent, sign, perhaps he has not understood, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
It's a feminine, so I, at the point where it's a misery, we don't even know when we managed to do a mask at all, and my wife answers, "Don't worry, I've understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
And the dot has given the head to the dot.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We keep moving much about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, after a few months, she arrived to Anna, it's the present.
It's a marvelous one, it's beautiful, it's also strong.
I believe that mine is a slightly part of it, and you have understood it, and even the most beautiful thing they brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that all the best people, has become the best me, the best of their suffering, and all the people who, in some way, find us.
Now this is not the potential.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but I know, how they're fat, because, if we talk about Down syndrome, we're all hundreds of vinylers, of analysis, we know everything, but very few of these people have had meetings with people, with disabilities, and then, to get back together a little bit ofappiness, so that's the thing.
[A.DE.]
No, why am I showing you this example?
Why you?
Because you, today, to know TED, talk to people, have made a little bit of fat, here's the invitation to make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life, both persons, but also from people around you, a very hard advertisement.
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to make a gradual through, a gradual underwater, here, to wake up the eyes, we have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me many times to lose, and that's why I like a regular polician to leave bricks, long my stories, and also this afternoon, with this sign.
It's the language of signs is the word disability, so I can't just allow you to try track of disability in your life, to enhance them and more importantly.
And remember that the paintings become brave, really thanks to heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like the masoce, that I saw, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple way, it changed my life, and I understood what my mission in the world, but in an internship, it captured me as many as it occurs every day, of how much it's a daily basis thanks to a traffic, and what's what happened to me is a shower thanks to a traffic.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable, just leaving food.
Why food?
And it's much more what we choose from orders to the recording is what we can decide, for ourselves, for our family, every single day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, saying that almost more one word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the life of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
Mr.C.
It's also about consumption, optimizing consumption, and especially the way in which we compose the bact every day, theattoo, so, what do we, effectively, bring it to a tank?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
The scary, so the less noble part, is in average almost 50% of the raw materials, but it's not just about regaining those things of rejects, meaning having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a joint together, let's take an example with my leg, and I can see it as a group of four ingredients, for example, the chicken.
And it's also when we can add the table, for example, a very practical example: we take a glass, but if we put it in the zero, to this zero, to what we have every time we use an electronic electrodom, like this, we must be too thrilled in the dust, because, in fact, if we eat our minds, and also to protect more than a code, which is served, that we can make another example, that we can make another example, that is a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of treated, like this, a bit of treated, or not, because there can be letters, let's stop there, let's stop protecting, letters, let's stop there, let's stop protecting, let us,
In other words, next year, HECPO will also be HECPO, and there are a lot of people talking about food of the future, I can say so much about insects, I believe I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you're agree with me, we're not a consumer home country, but here is a representation that we can, for more self-productive, which is part of the Italian tradition, which is part of the tradition of plant-based waters, maybe it's never eaten lungs.
But as simple as that, they're a very optimistic person and they're made of a hamstery, the damages of prejudice: this in favor, a great development of producers of professionals, are aware that they also ask for leaders, and maybe there are more people in the house, there are more people in the room, there are more people in the room, that led them, but also to take care of the hats, and then we could make a small change, and then make them happen, as possible, maybe, maybe, a small chance, there is a small lesson, once there is a small lesson, once there is a small change, there is a link to the other languages, and there is no other way, there is a link to the other, there, there is a little link to the other,
(Music)
[A.DE.]
A: I've brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six faces, one that comes from one to the "Sai."
The other one.
But he went with ten gangs: if I launch any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing?
Now let's play: you'll launch your side for ten gangs, I'll do it for you.
But come to this game, let's add an equal or largest number of mine.
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
Trying to the fact the ten earth is easier, but you must tell me approximately what is your probability of coming to this game?
I'll explain to you: a possible approach is based on the experience: I can launch data repeatly and capture data of every victory, after 100 lights, I'll realize that I'll get to the initial 75%.
But with the increase of releases, my stock based on the media of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
Later, if you had a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer, your port must deliver 100 million data in a single second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called "Mhodo Monte Carlo" for this capability of the computer to simulate the case, it is a powerful method, we can simulate a bunch of successful interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
About a way of magic, for this, four years ago, I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
(Laughter) Unfortunately, the method of Monte Carlo, that I was so stretched, was disappointed after the first week of PhD.
(Laughter) The environment of work at the University of Uorica and exceptional, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary level of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and humanity, unbearable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
And the dot can be a lonely path: I spend most of my time alone in front of a computer or an art of statistics.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach them: I was so tight, they think they were teaching math and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson.
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending, all that I needed.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't want to answer this question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I opened my degree, I started to live in teaching lessons and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to have a preparation of the solitary: I had to compassionate my students, to take them, and to make them fun, I tried to enjoy every opportunity, I got a diploma, more than twice, at the age of the most advanced countries.
The more workplace was, the more I became efficient, strong, determined, and then it wasn't about work.
Preparating evolution is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art, I really like to correct the benefits.
KA: Let's dare the students, the right mistakes they are, brings a constant learning process.
Then, there's the moment of performance, in the classroom you become a showman, and the opening to each store, the lesson is my protocol.
The gratitude of the students paying for my whole career, and I was talking about them, as much as they were learning about me.
And, during the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's universality warned me the award for eccellence in education, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my doctorate, I had so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way, I was experiencing something that works in large scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
At that point, I went back to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, you remember, why is the reason of all this euphoria, that floor, and the extent of determination?
The place I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that are sparked between more people, instead of evaluating that value.
Is there a concert?
Behind TED, this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence, a passion, a talent, the happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge, and my mind had already moved itself when I wanted to put in motion the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
But, as you've understood, the journey of learning is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
And we've told this captain of my story, precisely because I think what I've learned is shared, but we'll see, but we'll see, but we'll see, but we'll see, for example, find the purpose of motivation through the street that there weren't expectations, for example, to start a path that later it doesn't make sense.
There's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams: there are more richer than the students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
In his face of the time, I cut myself off the voice, there's already silence.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
A young girl in the first row asked me if I could give some attention to the questions of exams, I didn't know him, but I spent the Saturday night listening to the friends of the five-year-old years, I picked up everything they can expect a scholarship, they could have a successful choice.
(Laughter) It's true, we had recently had some time to practice, but there's a lot of material on the Internet, and I had to find it on the rear of the pantalla.
I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
(Laughter) I scratch the washing machine, but we often went to them to ask how to procedure, to each point in practice we created a theory element, which we repeat the stages together.
Anyone makes a very difficult question, but I had spent the dinner of their gender book, I was well prepared, I had it.
I work with them to make them take the breath, it's a saying, I fly, I invite them to the magnifying glass for the exam, a group of students breath, someone asks for example, but most of them only reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
I've got money.
But he teaches him how to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
Alright.
I had no courage, just to tell me.
But I just want to thank you.
Because what you do for us doesn't do it.
S: I stay in the classroom, and I have a huge smile, a bigger heart, and I think maybe...
But that's exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
Well, this is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are connected widely, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside the country.
(Laughter) I'm a mind runs.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
That's it.
Finally, I started November, very much, since 2003, during the release there was a "Selfie," and supported by the animal, Bafco's offspring, and they started to grow up from the bathrooms, we started to gather bass, finishing with research on prostate, in more than 219 million dollar bathrooms, moving, and global campaign, and now become a global movement.
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
What's interesting about change is that, as the law has already said before, that it's normal that you should change your feet, not all should do this, that means that change was a crucial theme, in the morning of my colleagues, they had it in a very clear way: now we all approached the change, the first thing that you have, beyond fear.
And the opportunity seems that here, right now, from diversity, you get away from the opposite, feeling that in this change there are many people: "Papa, but because Alessandro Luigi are two men, I say that the most normal thing, actually, if you don't know how to wear..." And I guarantee you, okay, I've already belonged to them both.
So this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and that's the difficulty a little, but, if you want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders of change, that I've been working for many years in companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
Then, when I drink this pen, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
But the word change accounts this word of change, I get a thinking that brings me - I don't know how many hours - and it begins to put into other words: transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and form an encouragement, hunt.
Kach, which is actually a prison: it's a bit of achievement that, in my opinion, clearly, this prosecutive of all personal personnel, a leader today of willing to be, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change, to the cake is an act, and it is a creative of transformation and change.
Well, what's the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then, the prospective change, the change of prospective, which I'm working on a project, I'm paid on the project, but what transformation I'm wearing, and in this way there's a transformation that will also be transformed into me, it's not what I've thought, but, to take this leap, to do things, to take pictures that move through this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, but I also have the permission to be afraid, but I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model is creative in its own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of works, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
And if this is true, it's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity, what you do with creative thinking, try to work on divergent and convergent thinking, but that's not enough, you have to take a leap and...
Finding a slightly deliberate movement, thus starting to involve that emotional part, that which is the fear of emotions, we have heard of emotional intelligence first, here, in an absence of being able to feel emotions and emotions, those forces, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And what's interesting is that doing this, it's not that you're in differentiation to the conting, and that to say what you see transformations, opportunities, let's say in manage, create the climate, but in reality, I'm not so much for the idea of managing that made these passages, just to satisfy ourselves in a mode of rule, but you enter into a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of both emotions leads you to do this.
What nourishes means that every day you build an environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can convince people to relate to each other, but they can also enable them to unleash, and that's not that simple in the organicative environments, because there's always the alibi of the results that we find in just one way.
On the other hand, dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, then what's interesting, when we get to this situation is exactly how I make myself aware of collecting the creative spirit.
And here, in addition, the impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact then that necessarily reminds you of whether it doesn't seem to be an organization, but also to reinvent the very client's relationship because the prosthesis is completely changed, then to get back to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
We could make a paradigm, change our paradigm, meaning what, so the sense of waiting that we saw earlier in the video, but that clearly feels to be aware of the situation of being conscious, of bringing the creative spirit, but of putting ourselves here today, spinning around Trento, observing people who are here, I can restore my curiosity, and then, in a few words, the courage to use.
We're about to land, to drop your confidence belts.
But how many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time we have the chance to see from the top the most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcasting human being.
The city.
And it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible that millions of people, for thousands of years, near these places to be together, are mass?
They choose to live not all separated, but with what we call cities.
And there will be an important question to your forehead: But it's positive or negative all this, but would it be better to enhance this phenomenon or limit it?
And this is a story that has gone back in time, in fact, this is Manchester, in 1845, was the biggest city and the most populated city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not so much, and in fact, in this city, the longest process of history began, with the most uneaspectful sentence, and the process ...
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They lived in Manchester, they saw tracks, without leaves, and they didn't see what today captivates you when you spend your weekend in New York or in Parigi, imagine, poverty in the end.
Interesting, but not that of today, the true smoke that made carbon particles prevent the view of one with the other.
And of course, both scratches with a book, of all the bad guys in the world, it was the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty, and there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible in which the city was accused.
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
There are also tools to limit this phenomenon, which is clearly the cause of all the problems of the world: Sciences, urbanism that you see here.
Something tremendous, that maybe you've ever heard about, that has bizzy tools, one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a glass at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then the improvement you might not know.
All, but that we can even say and pretend to imagine in a centimeter of the city, what should happen in the future, here a house, here a work, here a theater.
And then, let's imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about cities: a famous movie, a series of movies in the 80s traveled to New York, from Los Angeles, where Manhattan.
The interesting thing about this process, you may remember, is that, like all the processes, maybe even in a slightly lung, from 1845, there was a window of years ago, the sentence came.
And a specific case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growing of the population.
This is the solution, important elements that motivate this ability, which is the city of improving the world, the first, demography, inequality, environmental sustainability, confidence and economical development, the ability to create knowledge to all the great questions that affected to human gender.
Then, here's my idea that the impact in a boat, a seed at home, food, and they gather and eat together in a sink, creativity is the ability to imagine, in cities, that is, the fact that there are not only so many things in a small place, the city definition is no longer.
The vastness, the people, are all encouraged to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the PIB, no, the city of a mechanism, because as a black scat.
A great mechanism that transforms, different interests, many individuals that come from stories.
It's full of regions that have different goals, regions that have in Italy, as big, that the city definition no longer is a static definition: the city saves the world as long as it can generate this type of positive transformation, what?
But perhaps in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Or maybe even natives, maybe you may consider that, right now, we must usechanisms of tools of containment of the human phenomenon, with utopia and courage, and I will give you two examples, and that are not afraid of the human phenomenon, but that are trying to feed this virtuous mechanism.
And this is an image from the top of the city, of the satellite, and some of them were evident, not all of them, but a green group that was unknown in the center of the city, ten minutes per meter, from humans.
That's my idea, and this is also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, turned to the city.
But the idea is to name this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city as the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles of green, like that, and walking, for example.
To see the city maps can be imagined as an element of diversity and strength, believing in the positive things of the systems we live in, not leaving us.
We say nothing.
In traffic reform, the New York Music, before the solution sentence, the cities like the local.
Audience: to refer to the cement.
I don't know if you've all remember these stories.
The second example is instead of a city.
It has a few billion km from here, I have worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and it was some years ago: what could we do with this city in 2030 with all of the adventures, Buenos Aires more than in other countries is the head of all over the nation, the place where everyone finds a chance?
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, has been in some way uncertained.
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation of what was the solite?
The one that...
By comparing the bass with the same ability to believe the improvement of development, and also with courage to the strength of this mental weapon, which are the cities?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies: three strategies.
The development accelerates, and here you see an owner, a an intensity thin, which means a huge population.
It's a huge infrastructure and the creation of spacies, pedestals or glasses, you can see this.
It's density.
Piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a billion inhabitants in the city, replacing some more policies with more dense neighborhoods.
Changing ...
But the population not only of the aggentine but of the whole world and the creative to get together, and then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I suggest that they can increasingly believe in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned, social spaces.
Please!
Diver and pedonals.
It's this tragedy, fight together.
Then they were applied to the development of Buenos Aires, with science?
That cities are the solution to all, then in the world, then ...
It's still once again.
Keep choosing the spot on the spotlight, you will look at thealto, this great invention of humanity, which is the city.
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe?
You are willing to live in what I call, the section of the city.
Thank you all.
(Laughter) The words are important.
They put us in relation: the words of our language are extraordinary, they are on an opportunity that they are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion, are on note.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
[A.DE.]
And the beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about it.
My school in the yanglesis, the provincial and motivated many times dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
And it's starting to become common.
[A.DE.]
But it took a bit longer and I'll start to show you some Latin monks.
In Syria, there are many rats on their insecutions and the world's highest universities, and they show them with a huge gold: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia, in the UK, in Oxford.
In Chicago, the United States has a Latin motto, Canada, Kindland in Australia has a Latin motto, Parigi has a Latin motto, and with Latin mothers, because if there is a monk place in the world, daringly the Harvard University, says you see in your insecurity, because the American marine always says twiny-year-old, if the British marine, if you've sat down, always sat down, always finished, it always finished, it always finished, it has always finished, like NASA, like the otherwise, it hasn't been a writer, like the otherwise, like NASA has always been a writer, like NASA.
(Laughter) And that?
Exclusion: the "atural" of "attivo."
"Yes."
Have you seen that?
And what is the recent marriage, touristic in the city of Rome, has proven and launched the Human municipality, and that?
It doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, Miandyu," "Wow, Mendyu," what is this subscription of ugly blows, there is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each of us, what are the five details?
And one is asked.
Napel?
Because when we look at all the tourist patients in all the cities of the world, there is no one who leaves the point to settle their name, to land them, anywhere.
But it's just a dogma.
"Daddy, dad, you have your penetration."
Let's give you a totally twistical knock.
(Applause) A round of applause from the Benicuto Ministry: See it beautiful, ready.
(Laughter) No, it's not very beautiful to see, Beautiful: we collision Italian people in an insensite way, they don't even like anglophones, the thing.
It's curious, that's it.
G.G.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world, opposed to "Roomyangyu," "Stuitzado d'Org," the most dominant language in the world, according to linguists, in this association.
(Laughter) The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do things: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
But they study it for that.
We're talking.
We're talking about angels, like Thomas Mall.
And he said, "Why?"
Let's see, for example.
G: The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map that sold hamburgers or Otdoxon, came with the pizza.
So, if the whole world eats and says, "Pizza, why are we here in Italy guides?"
(Laughter) That's it.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
So, there's a story to promote, in the weekend of Italian wine, of Colombian wine.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Happy and plantations that sell food and wine.
And they say,
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence: let's drop food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
CR: It's the one who writes the Italian magazines in a way.
The "Luccorri Frendley," more "blem," directly from the passes of the Winter.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
[Inglese] Please stand up and ask you who is giving me.
A disorder.
Don't think about it as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
It's like they are in our job.
And the women we see in our mental birthrates, why do you run?
But let's see, there are no strings: this is the publicity spread via a vecture of us in Spain and in Spain, Spanish, this is a publicity of medals, for France, French, this is the same payment in Italy, in English, there are two, only Italian words: the first one.
What's happening to us if the union perfectly?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go to our radicies, let's call us, theand, this, "I union."
Riuniosi.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalian, isn't it?
But we are segmented.
Here's the curious thing, because, for two reasons, an Italian out of two doesn't like an English word.
I am 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we see it.
And who?
We have to wait for the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled with the sign, who has compiled this model of the formula, to be superior, linguistic competition.
However, every day, for immigration, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are controversial.
We use a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
(Laughter) Not deeply, it's said in the text of the Italian language, she has purely access and subtle.
CR: We said colors, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I heard them say, "The bucket is the "lockering" that we chose for the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
ACP: In the ufficies you can feel, we have to split a set of toothpaste lines united from the outsk versatisfaction.
With business it's united.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the official service, because the unit is always like, straight and newspaper.
(Laughter) The Internet and the e-mail talk not only about it in companies, but also in average, public recording, the government, in English, that won't be more sympathetic, because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea, I was in detail that I had to do something, communicate my partner, I have in mind two processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my office, to put a start on the internet to make military sensibilization on this problem: free, and without spending a price, simply putting us a bit of competence, communication and trade, and a bit of energy.
But what is the appetition?
who invented public records, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian, and the first group at the Cusca Academy, because, as a result, became the protagonist of this idea of sensibilization: we were expecting a speech, but not what happened, in less than a month they filmed, naming Dizzo's name, and in fact, 70,000 people.
They signed stories of Italy, they filmed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who didn't spike that the workshops signed up professional suppliers and called pensioners, signed Italian people in the west saying, "What does our language do?"
Singapore, Jedus Jalemy, from Peduda, South Africa and north Africa.
But from Canada, as a cost, it's one thing with movement: I had spent hours watching these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
And we could make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a doer, we are in the novel of the flash, if we think abundantly, we talk about another etangoscodetically, working in a public recording, support.
The movie, because I studied classic studies, "To work with economists."
(Laughter) Later in fashion, I've received a prize of laughing, it's not for the intrudence of the trend, I don't think there's gone.
(Laughter) An Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Swiss.
(Laughter) And we know what we're wearing AND.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Cchung, go Rome's food."
So I started to let me talk about our language decence, because I'd never like to say you are diagnosed and funnels that split from occasions.
For Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, Paese, Beijardi, Bergata, I'm stubborn to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they reinforce the bottle of Company, but you do it, and so on, strongly because I don't believe those who say "CUL is cool."
But the movie, because I've heard of it, the universities that say displegated, instead, that they visualize.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old, thanks for engines.
That's it.
As I mentioned, an extraordinary ecosystem transversing, because in mass communication, they imprisoned this thing between 0 and the year wide.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the stamp on the dispubblic side, but the gathering with great applause, the section of Italy and the sale.
He spoke about Wired, and Vaniti Faire talked about, he talked about Christian family, he spoke about Turing's Mexico, he spoke about today that the behind him made an event: azensity.
Why?
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in interactions, it also touched me to put myself in the city, and on the beach of the Eastics, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lady.
Well, we need this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
And we have all streams, the Italian.
I remember some of the reasons to do it: how to operate but italian, helps us understand and it's a fact of dismaking, because we can understand a fact of dismaking.
They don't want norms, they don't want to suffer, they want to give good examples, and we need to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Knowing more crazy, we turn each lobby, it's beautiful, also protects the brain, through the more than a language, but throwing theingue, uses one by the way.
(Laughter) In English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten, and so the one who talks about how he manages, spoke better.
And then Leonardo was mentioned, in the first of the talks of this newspaper.
The championships that defined himself "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he'd scratch the volcano, in Italian, always the structure, the way of decency, helps us express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign to express one of our pecuriarities.
Even if our linguistic thesis is strengthened and used to be able to pick up some terms of strange.
So, we need to enhance it inside a couch that is not fulfilling and it's loosed by losing sense of what is necessary to an excess, of terminals, or of evil, why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, in Italian.
With our identities, our radicies, our history, our openness to the world, that passes from our words, thank you.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
And when does a guy look bad?
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
G: But if that person is also something that isn't your mom, or your grandma?
What happens to you, if mom or dad or her parents started to feel bad if a child or a teenager still had the hardest idea of being a young age, like everyone went to school, laughing and dying with friends, but what's behind these photos that you don't see?
First of all, I'd like to give you a step back, to always start again at the beginning: If you ask what has changed, what is it totally different?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother to the center, to my adulthood that I'm currently passing through my teenager who you see without record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called "S health Problem," and when a parent hits, and you're still a child, a teenager, they're your reference points, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harassment, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they change their way back: the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
The difficulty to concentrate is also having to look at domestic facencies, as to do the thesis, or to hang around with hammeries, they're the nicest lines, or to talk to the doctors and to manage therapy.
[A.DE.]
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But in addition to this, we'll have to do with the alternation of being in depressive bags, without anyone preparing to do it, or even wishing or setting up at the suicide attacks.
But in addition to all this, I also had to keep doing the whole life, go to school, study, why I'm here today and adding another character, which is often not able to talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your OK, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you, as a genetically committed and destined to automatically, or if there's no diagnosis to describe the same disorder, but if they do something that doesn't answer the whole eternal world will be completely different.
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a ring to understanding what happens inside you and your love, a ritary to ask and receive access, many times, not to receive a cure, and to you that if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceived around you the difficulty of communicating inside you and family members, stigma, prejudice, sword, can be carried inside you and don't say anything right: there was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice that allowed me to be far away from them, because it made me grow up before the others.
And at the same time there was also a result of help, a result of help that couldn't allow us to go out, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
And when the first grade started to open, in that horn, when, for the first time, light started to filter, remember again the psychologist of the family consultant, who is the first person affected was the family, with whom I had the chance to open myself, and who helped me, obviously, to individuate for the crazy lines that had brought me to the travelers.
And the stories of our children of parents with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
And you know why it happens because of our children's stories we don't talk about, but it's statistically impossible, in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to be one, that there is no other who has experienced the same things we've lived with us.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that natural reactions to what I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics that were born precisely to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path, on my own, and I went to Vancouver in Canada, to meet these children, because their view, the story I've experienced, but also the story of writing, their view, the pain, but also the ability to transform that pain together with a change, that I didn't recognize myself, but that seeing the characteristics of resilience reflects to suffer from a cultural disorder.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017 with other Italian children, Gaia Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association, created by children for other children, all the doctors and scientists who don't have a voice, to give voice to children who don't even have to be cured for their disturb, and they don't even have to be cured for their mental disorder, and for a period of time.
But at the beginning, when I thought about this project, another desire we have is to give up both institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and to find people in civil society who may not have experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in the change, and to take a sharp of the need to the owner of our minds, to their communities' library, and now we managed to reach so many regions, from the seed until the Sarde, we don't stop, we won't make it as bad as it happened.
It's to save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that parents with mental disorder we have, is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that these kids will make their desire happen, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open for us, let's get the light, thank you.
Today I want to talk about a special person: Aaron Sfarz.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and it's easier but it's a list for the technical of projects he collaborated with for about ten decades, and an intellectual until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, it became a small start-up to build something that is connected to something called a network, becomes a millionaire from one day to another, it continues to do what has always done to build an open and collaborative internet, that spends with the Internet and Open Liberari, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, because it would go to Buduto, on archives of digital memory.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years ago, all the tasks of computer education revolved with the capital of March under the arm at 16 years.
And this is what I'm telling you about fright at a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn highly: he told his mother that, at some point, she was staying there, and a Aaron was two and a half years old, hanging on that fridge and showed her the avenue on the fridge she had just attacked with her kids in the socks.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at Aaron's projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information, HIV's Internet preserve memory, at RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, that allows blogs to synchronize, creativity, so they make access to people of content, creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information, that we just need to think of a second at anywhere, we are in schools, libraries, universities.
But power information also talked about Mility, also about Montessori, which means giving access to information to people is to say, making a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education, without this there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
Aaron came to this genius which he is, this came from his cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker, not as a hut, not as a hut.
When you know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reading the world a better place requires access to this information.
So if all institutions are social are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so they are made of words, everything becomes accountable at the moment when we know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this with it: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become a monopolic act, but you become a building act.
[A.DE.]
Circa, in 2011 Aaronne was interested in this thing called Open HACS, a great movement for free access to scientific literature, the world which is absolutely caotic and controversial, contradictory.
Many great editorials have the keys of power making scars what scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
And Aarone is passionate about this, scratch this thing called Open Hux, guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it from another here in Italy: the first steps was power information.
There are dozens of thousands of artists, hundreds of thousands of artists from an academic database, manager, and it was bidden, AFBI was interested in it, not a hacker of this genius probably hadn't been observed.
It means that your opportunity to do that Aaron, an example, want to give you a simple example to show all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules.
Then came the aromine made of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of hundreds of thousands of artists from walked to the academic fish and could do it, but not in that scenario, they were answered at 35 years, two years later her first armon is involved at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the engineering who holds the system, well, these will leave you with all the strength combined with the ingrangements around you, I would like to show you now a minute through the last intervention of arnospharies, a few months before dying.
I think it's a bit like that ... (Video) (English) I'm a very happy person.
But he also sent all the tickets to watch.
I said, "Yes, how can you do it..." "Yes, that's it..." (Laughter) "Yes, that's it, that's it."
And what about it?
It has seen a little in prospective: requisition of Craig and Biten, and Bitcoin, of Bitcoin, and in Bitcoin and Bitcoin.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two edible polarizers of the Internet, it's a mass spionage platform that is used to spy, to check, to oppress, and there's another prospective: the Internet is fantastic, liberated, is extremely complex, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish not comparing my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave, and to make living is not something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell that we live every day, that we are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
[A.DE.]
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become part of it, until the point of not seeing it anymore, the second risky requires attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make it last and give it space.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everyone, then in 1950.
I was eating with some physical colleagues in the area of the lab of Losalamos and improvedly I had a look at theattoo and asked where all of them are.
Then, if life was apparent, it was not overwhelmed, had made a reason, that could be in the smart gallery as an intelligent, incredibly larger than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, compared to us, but the most simple thing is that there is no one outside, that we are alone.
The distance between the tip of my dental hand, here is this: in a sea, in a sea of space, and therefore, surely, in that moment, they were observing, in my quote, that we are, for example, in a center of the universe, which is located in a very big speed, in a speed, in order to understand, that there are many, very big, that there are many, much bigger, there are more than 4,000 kilometres, there are, there are, for example, that there are, there are plans, there are plans, there are plans, there are plans, there are plans, there are plans, letters, let's say that there are plans, letters, let's say that there are plans, letters, let's say that there are plans, letters, letters, letters, let's say, let's say, let's say that there are plans, letters, letters, letters, letters, letters, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say that there are plans,
The dinosaurs appear, and therefore, this gives us an idea that this long history to the path of the life's life revolution on Earth was a long, difficult, accidentated by unbelievable events, so I didn't have to bring, necessarily, to the origin of the most complex organisms, I didn't have to bring to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species, which is, in all of this, in all of this, where we are.
But the whole history of humanity is at the end of an Afghan, we could completely spoil the road with a Lima's field, and this has already happened, because today we know that for decades of thousands of years on our planet have been around us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
If a hard, after all, we think that we could consider that in the universe no one would be a simple battery, the seed could be dominated by microbes, saying something, maybe they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes every day, as I hope you will find out that there is another life in the universe, and it's very likely that it will be a microorganisms of the universe, maybe it would never be considered that we were.
And we were alone in all this space, and I think that even more we have the gift of keeping access until we get this wonderful debt, full of consciousness, sorry, for example, we are a very young species, but we have, at least, the opportunity to help the scientific knowledge and technology to face the problems that we need from a wonderful future, to end up in the debate of the world, thanks.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport, but not from the act of victories, not from the fact that someone has come first, classify them, but sport makes you believe, it gives us the strength to go forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I enjoy running, and here is me, after these 116 Chileans, with all the participants who instead of running, instead of being worried about coming the first or coming the last few, we came together after these 116 Chilean agoners.
The journey is the difficulties, right now, from the first days: we're terrified to WindOC, which is high inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough.
The difficulties we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a night cover, a cover of 15 Chileans, so it's very simple, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
We can do it during our attitudes, but the desert is general, the choir is a bit like the metaphor of life, no, you start doing things.
Later, during life, imprevists happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, if it's time to do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the chance to react, and I had the first difficulty to have after three kilometers.
Good afternoon everyone.
(Laughter) Like my petrest!
It didn't bring it back, (Laughter) and, of course, things that map it, it did.
Okay.
When it's in the desert, it's complex, I couldn't mock, because in this jungle was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to pick up budgets for the pitch against Chileans, which is during the second cover, to the exact level of a meditation we have, but, I didn't know, it's not a tumour, but a colour, but it's a tumour, but it's a tumour, but it's a very often, very fast, to be very calm, to be very calm, because we can move to these children.
And we also feel during all our ideas.
Build, during all our workplaces, inhabitable places, we feel inhabitable, we feel.
All the kids to be happy where there's nothing, and when they run 15 or 20 kilometers around you there's nothing, powerful, but unfortunately, in the desert you realize you're a point, maybe wherever you and I run, with 15, 20 kilometers, where there's nothing, no, at the last night.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at some point in the desert a night we went to eat and stood.
It depends on the pulmine, there was scens.
In this desert, it's going to take a wake from a backpack, it's the door to this warning and it tells us, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this wake."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, teach.
The anamibia desert is the desert that I chose because inside the Namibia desert there is the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when you're here, we've made it of strings or almost, of corsa, you see it here on the tip of the border, which then descend from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because the desert also has medicine, but it's important, sometimes, sometimes, to valuate how much we are fortunate, as we are fortunate.
Being out of the Duna is not easy, I ran little, old walking a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the Duna, I was already in Chile, only five Chileans were left.
(Laughter) We are already in Mexico City, which also shows the dome of a pack of the world here in Namibia, and that's what I did.
(Sigh) Sorry, Margano, Jolithemy, 4 km/h, the owner window.
(Sound of discourse) "I'm happy.
[Inglese] Thanks to all that I've been giving strength, [Inglese] Chiao brings me, brown, come, I've become a chicken!
I found, in the desert, even when this morning I was talking about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people who shared me, other than 26 people, because it was a garage with many contents, 96: they were 96 and 96 people who fled with me in the end, the last internships could make a magic, an incredible magic.
Z: Excuse!
C: No, little.
As you can see, they were all very humble during the sequence, because the horses were a bit rigid.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician seas, you can go back, do the other Chilean, you can go back further, because the project had the option, which is, to get to the inside, in numbers you, always, important and recurrent, the interesting thing that we arrived at the end and the highest functions.
The money drop was over and achieved its goal: on December 20th, 2016 that if you take the figures, they are exactly the numbers that make 116 km, or 116 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sportive, I smoked, here I had other caps, and people had to do it.
I was surely facing 100 meters and already made a big deal, right?
I wasn't alone.
Use them.
Look: "Haha".
But beyond having a wife that is enough, I had two children, a little bigger, Riccardo, who has already ten years, and the other Pietro, who was six, and nothing, Ricking to go to the fourth and Pietro, in first elementary, so big, the situation, but unfortunately life is there.
It's a bit like the race, what I've just mentioned before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to act, unfortunately Pietro has had a celebrating hemorrhage that photography, during birth, and has letting it hard, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
(Laughter)
When it seemed that everything was going well, on February 18th, 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too tight, OK?
(Laughter) The garage is called Ran,16 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
It's certainly not.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
Wow!
And in these moments...
But you don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
Good afternoon.
(Applause) Continuing?
(Applause) Keep on trying to give you the strength to those who are teasing, because remember that problems are always the ones who are left behind.
And give the chance to the other two that arrived: it arrived to Emma, and it's never arrived on the 29th of July to San Pietra.
And eventually Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and I didn't want to drop myself, so I had to do what to manage to create or improve my life, to improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say this visually, but above all, from the physical point of view, to give strength to people.
