Controlated.
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently far away: Be, you must know that until some time my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to sleep, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this evening.
Then, the story begins with the little child: Ricciolin, you're empty.
But intrappolated from a terrible incessive.
But the words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years pass, the child becomes a boy.
But we suffer a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, it's so much that it proves to meet psychologists, psychologists, all brave people, a lot of professionals, but nobody knows how to take this moment.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, there was a little girl called Teresa de Calcuta.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
You'll ask a child, what will happen?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said, "Madre Teresa, but what a beautiful word of freedom?"
Instead...
The child thought, "I'm not.
Interesting.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man to try the battles he had written, the fought comics was too big, and he didn't think: free of the surgeon, took the microphone and said, "Salva todos, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the internet that my first words as I was born were: web, web!
Then it was like this: people would laugh, and he was happy because the words used, fluid, in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
And something was successful, but the most beautiful thing.
It was that this young man, at that time, that people didn't laugh anymore.
They were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my family would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you're TED."
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, "This is a bit the problem of having the Egocentric dad," my mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
And, in other words, they would get the best of themselves.
What is a moment, I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part, and if it also works the opposite.
And then?
Because I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
What was it working?
I worked with people, all the people I met, who became part of my life, have taken out and are truly taking the best part of me.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Behind, believe me, finding a disability, can fear a little.
Then, who is a genius?
Or it is becoming a genius.
It's generating.
Disability.
Well, this is the biggest one of the pairs.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife who is in the fifth, a physician shells us to flood in a very small stone, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single sedentary.
And she makes my wife walk again.
Let's take the paper and read it.
A 21 trisomy.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Boom is angry.
A: Not to be afraid.
But my wife's father's harp.
She says, "Yes, puzzled, dotted, but our son is a mask and a female."
The doctor says: "Hey, man, maybe she didn't understand, trisomy 21 is the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
Then the dotter is always more spathetic, close.
And then I, as a matter of qualma, pork, misery, we don't even know when we managed to make a mask out of nothing, but it's dark.
And the dot has given the head to the dot.
Thank you very much.
Well, we're moving a lot about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult one.
Also our lives, because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyway, after a few months.
It has come.
"Ana."
I'll introduce it to you.
(Applause) A marvelous one, eh?
It's so beautiful!
It's also strong.
I believe mine is a sort of judgment, you understood it.
And yet, the most beautiful thing that brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that we've come to all the best people, has become the best of me, the best of my wife, the best of her family, and all the people who, in some way, find them.
Now this is not the potential.
But we've noticed one thing: all the people we meet are all very informed from the technical point of view of disability, especially from the Down syndrome, we are all full of speeds, analyses, we know everything, but very few, very few of these people have had meetings with people.
Hundayability: and then, to put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone news" and "Second Anna".
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, how one goes to school," where so, without predicting too much seriously, but right now, let's tell the notable noises they bring, but then this part is here.
(Laughter)
Or another one, where it says, "But is it true that you suffer from Down syndrome and don't give birth to blue eyes?"
(Laughter) Bella is said, with ideas syndrome.
Because we believe that words also have their importance.
And also because, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, one X in addition, I don't know, I'll give you an example: have you present TED, you include a small X?
[A.DE.]
No, why am I showing you this example?
Why you?
Why do you, today, for us?
Following TED, talking to people, you've done a bit of fatigue, and here's the invitation is to make a little bit of fatigue, and don't avoid the disabled encounters you've ever had in your life, both persons, but also some people around you, a very hard advertisement.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on or a bathroom.
So, to look at each other, you have to put themselves at the same level, and in this sense, to capture me many times of losing, that's why I like a politician to leave rooms with my stories, and well, I also did this afternoon with this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability, so I can't just allow you to look for paths of disability in your life, to enhance them.
And most importantly.
And remember that the paintings that you watched in the face are truly brave, thanks to your heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a personally, like maoce, who sees, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, my life changed.
And I understood that my mission in the world, in fact, it wasn't even a bunch of bees, nor a romantic disorder, as some speakers gave us before, but in an ortag, it didn't go well, it could go further, while you had an ortags, to realize how it occurs every day, how much it takes a be, thanks to a traffic, and that made me change things.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable.
including food.
Why food?
And food?
It's what we have more freedom to choose, what we can decide for ourselves, for our family, every single day.
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but also an environmental impact that might be the way we dress or how we fly to the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And my word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense.
And it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially what is our movement with food.
To optimize means, for example, the way we use sponsors.
Then, how much we decided to acquire, for example, the thing to buy the right, which, indeed, serves, to find the most likely to push the mirrors, and then, obviously.
Trying to use 100% of the subjects.
It's also about consumers, optimizing consumers, and especially the way in which we create the behavior every day.
So, theattoo, what are we really wearing the table?
Lili scares, I'm part of this project, so, through the encounter with affection.
I propose the end of the file, of the rejects, of what we often use on the streets, where in front of you have a small example of sidewalks in the first towns, we are used to do what I'm doing now, every day at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate them from one place there's the noble part, that we use and there's the scarce.
And the scary, so the less noble part, is in average to at least 50% in winter, reaches up to 70 feet, because a lot of vegetables have more protected areas.
So what optimizing in the kitchen means to simply recover those things from rejects, means changing food, that means using 100% of the raw materials, but that's not mean having a different approach.
Let's see all these parts as a joke together, let's take an example with the window.
Mela can see her as, okay, a candle, but I can also see her as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup.
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us behave.
And the busk?
Magarius I'm eating it like this with me, or maybe it's convenient, and I'm doing a fantastic Tisana that you buy in Boristeria, it probably gives me more time, the tube, the tube, the focus and gives it to every ingredient moment, another example, one of the ants that can make us want to breastfeed.
I love 100%, for example, juice me a lot because the bus is the veracity, the one where the fiber is concentrated.
It's less than the dust, which perhaps if you don't like the dust too much, you can focus on the bus, and it's also the part that has more fibers, so a benefit certainly for health, but not only, with all internal features, I can make them manage one thing, I think it's a practical example.
It's a very easy technique, but it allows us to transform and value something that we all have at home, and that we usually don't stop a gaze and that we travel, so, to optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that.
particularly the ants, but all the food.
To sprease less and appreciate the maximum: optimizing means optimizing the consumption of energy heater, for example, every time I cure too much or toothpaste or vegetables, in contemporary, water had other things.
It's also used to cure it, and it's not just a provocation, I'm sure that some of you are shooting the gear, but it's a very high-scale swimming technique, the bass temperature, so it doesn't happen that you buy with the water, and you listen well, and it relies in the middle of the dark pieces, so when we're in war, OK.
There was a lot of food.
And we had few proteins, they would eat a lot of potatoes, of pollen.
And really, when they could put the table, for example, the males, the protective jokes, it was a party, and it worked like this: now, the problem is opposite, we have so much discomfort, and we have a little tendency to put everyone in contact with the doppy of proteins that serves us, because it's a problem.
It doesn't do us, so the classic portion of the recording, but also that we make ourselves in our hands, that can be from our legs to our fish, in fact it's too frightening, and eating so many vegetables, in fact, we take a large part of our we need daily proteins.
(Laughter) To change more than what is used is a spreco of resources, it's certainly something we could improve, if, moreover, these proteins are animal proteins that have certainly an environmental impact.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put a few less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have an important health of certainly environmental benefit.
It's about our health, but also of the kings of all of our country, even more if we did it at the world level.
Also in terms of public sphere, public policy for health, and also a benefit of well-being of the singer and obviously for society, I believe it's more efficient to try to eat them as quality, and the most likely to privilege the animals with a low environmental impact, which you'll be asking yourselves.
Well, in other words, in the next year, Apple will also be, and there are a lot of people that talk about food of the future, like the future, I mean many insects, personally I believe I'm not doing as part of our culture, we're not just a home consumer of insetti, and I think we'll hardly become it, but there's also a protein food that is extremely important to impose zero.
What can we do to make ourselves more self-productive at home?
Because any of us can self-produce them are a generous production that is part of the nutritional waste of vegetables, maybe not the ones that will carry on a store, but the things that we are not able to use of what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the ospits, and that, even more, we can in Italian.
And here in the room, who among you has never eaten the lights?
Okay, who would never eat them?
[A.DE.]
You see, probably ten years ago this number would be inferior, we had more covers of bright lights, around 35 years ago, a law that prevented us from collecting them, not only because of the use of food, but also because they are used for money and for other users, but it's a food that also requires chefs.
It's really so much to dare, extremely versatile, a extremely delicate taste, it's enough to know how to do it: to save your lungs at home, it's just a little packaging, a gold, a little bit of land, a queue, to not make them scape.
For the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room that eat them and not that they will never eat them, certainly they require a small change of mentality and especially of a prejudice, so a sustainable revolution, I'm convinced that it can be at the door of any of you.
And that really riches a small change, of course a change of mentality and the surplus of prejudices, are aware that to ask yourselves to carry the glass, to eat all the bottles, start to compensate the lights that isn't such a simple thing, but they're really many, so united to me and the benefits are really many, they are for our planet and our planet.
Thank you.
QD: I brought two data with me.
A: One.
A piece of data with six faces, take part from one to the other.
The other one.
But he went to ten gangs.
If I launch it, any value from one to ten has the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play.
And you launched the side of ten gangs.
And I can do it.
Let's start this game, put an equal or largest number of mine.
six to five.
Happings have come to the play.
Trying with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
Well, a possible approach is based on experience.
[A.DE.]
But I can completely release data and take the data of every victory.
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventy seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you'll see that the probability of victory approaches 75%.
But with the remote increase, my stomach based on the media of the succession.
It gets more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
Later, if you got a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
Your portal must deliver to release in about 100 million data in just one second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the mathematical problem is called Monte Carlo methodo for this ability in the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can simulate a data release, but also...
The behavior of a fluid, or the evolution of a colony of a epidemic colony.
Or even the abandonment of financial systems.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To me, it's just a way of magic, and that's why ...
Four years ago I began my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
And unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which I was so much streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
The environment of work is at exceptional level.
I have my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the end of the day, and the two professors that follow me are intelligence, competition and humanity, unstoppable.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
And the dot can be a lonely path.
I spend most of my time sitting on a computer or on a statistical article.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
That's it.
I was in movement, it seems to be a topic that was used for a mathematician that studied West, but I can guarantee you that at that time my mind was more than breeding, parallel.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
(Laughter) And so tight, think, teach math and English.
For the first 40 minutes, I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson.
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending.
Everything that I lacked before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
But I didn't want to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I introduced myself to gaufight.
I started to live in lessons and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't enough to be prepared alone. I wanted to compassionate my students, get involved, surprise them, and make them happy.
But I tried to take advantage of every opportunity, I got a diploma in didacts with university students: I began to teach two hours to student from the first year to more than twenty years to births of more advanced things.
But the majority of the workplace, the more I became efficient, strong, and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
I had realised in every aspect of learning.
Or preparing the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
But I really like to collect my compounds.
KA: Let's dare the students, the right mistakes they are, brings a constant learning process.
Then there's the moment of performance, in the classroom becomes a show.
And in each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
The gratitude of the students paying for my whole career, and I was talking about them, as much as they were learning about me.
Throughout the third year, there was also a specific recognition: Warrick's University gave me the award for the influence in the pregnancy, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my PhD, I got so many insatisfactions, but this was never in a different way.
(Laughter) It was all that natural, beautiful, brilliant.
But in my small child I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
What's the point?
I have to face everything that had happened in such a short time.
When you got to that question, the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
Why is the reason for all this euphoria, that fuel, that dissemination?
The place I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing themselves to such a value situation.
Is there a concert?
Good afternoon.
Stad, at this event.
Or a stone, a book, a trip?
Or an experience, an operation, a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
And my mind?
And it will be in the movement, at the moment I had tried to put the lies of my students.
In Aghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm going to finish in the next few months, and that's when I decided to take my next step.
As you have understood, the passion of embarrassment is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find themselves to give life to this magic of sharing knowledge.
But let's see, I told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
A method to explore this part, for example, the possibility of intraprending a path that doesn't come back to what we thought, or find finality in motivation through the street that there were no expectations, as catalizing our talents and the culture of sharing.
There's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
Have you ever seen herself?
I switch my voice, it's already silent.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
But a young girl, in the front row, asked me if I could dare some instructions about the women's questions.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to witnessed the friends of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a model, they could have just been elected, another one, a few of them, and I asked myself where to find other exercises to prepare.
It's true, we've had very little time for this practice, but there's a lot of material online, and there's a place to show it on the rear of the schermoke.
I'm satisfied, OK, the show starts.
I scratch to the food, but many times I used to ask how to procedure, every point of practicing we rich a element of theory that we repeat the stages together.
Anyone was a very difficult question, but I had spent the afternoon on their testo book, they were well prepared, I had it.
I start with them to make them take the breath: it's a saying, fly, I bring them up to the glass for the exam.
A group of students breath.
But someone asks for evidence, but most of them only reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
I've got money.
But he teaches him how to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
Alright.
Take the courage, just to tell me.
But I just want to thank you.
Why what do you do for us?
But don't do it.
S: I stay in the classroom, and I have a huge smile, a bigger heart, and I think maybe...
This is exactly what belongs to my place in this world.
This is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are connected widely, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside the country.
(Laughter) I'm a mind runs.
G.G.
On November 2th, I was growing up, and I supported by the cracks of Bafon, where MOVE, Dario à Mosca, Trento, Tedarch Cherrento, we put Bach, and they start growing bathrooms, let's take us for December Provember, for November Proprince, very profile, much more than 9 million dollari, from Movender, from Mender, from Mender, Mender, and Mender, the world's campaign, and the world's campaign has become completely different.
Good afternoon everyone.
And today I want to tell you how a voter has changed my vision about leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
And that's how a bit of freshness came into a bar, I wrote a book.
What's interesting about change is that, as the law has already said before, we all face the change, as if it were the most normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but actually, when everyone approaches change, the first thing you have, is beyond fear.
Your diversity, your diversity, your diversity, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what am I doing?"
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know how to pull, right?
And the opportunity appears here, right now, from diversity, in other words, as integrating.
Then everything that has brought a different look, remember one day my daughter.
Alright.
It's a mom home, we had a family of friends, girls, and at some point the girl says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Look, we are really three men, and he says, "No, they are both, you are with mom!"
And I guarantee you: OK, I was already up to the question, because then you don't know what to answer a child, especially if you're small, I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
Then, this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and that's the difficulty a little, but, if you want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders of change, that I've been working for many years in companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
But it's not the immediate thing.
Well, the most brilliant leader does this thing, so always drinking this cake, at some point it started to write, I'm always in the United States writing in a paper.
But the word change accounts this word of change, I get a thinking that brings me - I don't know how many hours - and it begins to put into other words, transformation, creativity, until when, in play, I start putting inside these words and form an encouragement, hunt.
Knowing that in reality is a prison, it's a little affection that, in my opinion, clearly, this is a prosecutive of personal whole.
And a leader, today, must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: hunting is an act of change, the creative knowledge of transformation and change.
Which is the new setting here, for me, at least, the new income is exactly in the dimension of not only change: we are often called to manage change, meaning in Germany.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
Then the prosthesis is the change of prospective change that I thought, but, that of taking this leap, of doing things, to fulfill the good things.
To make projects, bring people from one side to another, and all of this is done thanks to what, to the development of creative thinking, which is a bit of leading them to change this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, I'm allowed to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've imagined it, then, through five pillars, a little the ability to dream, that is that everyone is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of works, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
What if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can integrate your simple creativity. San morning we have started with a tunnel, with brainstorming, and this is one of you that allows you to fulfill your creativity.
What does with creative thinking about working on divergent and convergent thinking, but this is not enough, you have to take a leap and...
To make a slightly deliberate movement, so to start involving that emotional part, that which is the emotional frame of emotions, the frame of emotions, we have heard of emotional intelligence first, here, to reach the absence of sex to emotions and emotions, those that make you feel a hero, but also those that make you feel...
Here's the fear, that when you feel that it's not courageous and to take the leap, and you don't do it, it's also those, when you know about your emotions, you can let yourself support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that doing this ...
(Laughter) It's not that you become indifferent to the conting, in other words, it's not that you do a modification of fear, no, but you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of both emotions leads you to do this.
I want to share with you several examples of leader who have made these tests, just to suffer in Italian fields, certainly deserve.
On the other day, it was awarded as the world's biggest company, precisely for innovation and is increased by 67%, that is to say what?
Transformations.
They see how to say inside, but not so much for the idea of managing, but also for nourishing, and thus the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way, because the only difficulty today is in supporting leaders to identify that with their behaviors can generate.
But something that has a concrete impact inside organic interactions, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can relate to each other, but they can also allow them to unleash, and that's not that simple in the organic processes, because there's always the alibi of the results that we find only in a single way.
But on the other hand, dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, it also offers the opportunity to do that, to explore new ways.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and, in the end, if you ask an adult, "How do I do it?"
Do I get involved in collecting creative spirit?
It's here.
Well, this is precisely the impact you have when you do this, when you get involved in dreaming, it has an impact that necessarily happens if you don't act as an organization, but also to reinvent the customer's relationship because the prosective is completely changed.
Then, to return to that original beer.
Well, the idea is precisely.
We can change our paradigm, change our paradigm, in other words, what to happen in the situation of being conscious, of reaching the creative effect, but of putting ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not so wrong.
(Laughter) So the sense of attention we saw in the video.
It's like saying: guide is the volcano for the development of creative thinking.
But this feels clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, that of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen first inside of you.
And then out, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
We are about to land.
Let's light the belt of security.
But how many times will you be captained?
Is it the only time?
But there is a chance in it.
Then, let's see from above.
The most amazing thing.
The most powerful, the most diffused invention of man.
The city.
And it's also the only time you have probably thought: how is it possible that millions of people, for thousands of years?
Check it out!
But these places to be together, get together.
They can live not all separated, but together.
But in that one...
We call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: But it's positive or negative all this, but would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city.
It's more populous from the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money, and in fact, in this city started.
What I call the longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
(Laughter) And the process?
It's obviously the growing process.
And these two kids started, and they became quite famous.
Kar Marx is his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
(Laughter) They didn't see what today captivates you when you do your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
F.B: They were coming.
Strad dead, without daughters.
In conclusion, poverty.
The question, but not that of today, the true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
Because it was called condemn.
One of the operating classes in cities.
When the city of all the bad guys in the world were the city to be a cause.
Inquination, insicurity, poverty.
And there was no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible.
It was like saying?
It's a malicate reach.
But there's something necessary, sometimes, but it can contain.
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
But I was also born with tools to limit this phenomenon called Chiara.
Probably, because of all the problems of the world, there were science, urban art, which you can see here behind.
Something tremendous, that maybe you've ever heard about, that has bizzy tools: one is called quite a service, which is the rock where, when you have to change a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then the improvement.
The piano, in other words, the idea that there is someone from the event that has to dream.
GV: The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or is it still for the reason why, fortunately, you have never met?
Anyone, but what can you even say?
It's about imagining a centimeter of the city.
What had to happen in the future, here a house.
It has a feffice, a theater.
And then, let's imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot about the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles, where Manhattan.
It became an incontrollable isolation system, a city full of violence and land, so much to drop it, and maybe for those who watched the movie, becomes a jail where all the world's catals are launched by the upset and scanned forever.
The interesting thing about this process is that, like all the processes, this was also for example a little lung from 1845.
There's a 'anni' window.
The sentence comes.
"Yeah!"
The unique case in science, this sentence, is a total solution sentence.
But not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
Then you find out that the city is not the cause of everyone, then in the world.
Under the growth of the population.
S: Try.
It's the solution to all the big questions related to human beings.
And demography?
Inquination, environmental sustainability, safety, economic development, work creation.
But it's the ability to create knowledge.
In fact, this feeling also fits three.
The elementary elements that motivate this ability, which is the city to improve the world: the first is the density, you see what my picture is made from the highest of my city.
Therefore, the density, in other words, how many more people, how many more activities, how many more imaginations they can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are few richer people from all over the world, people call other places that, like me, also ignore the name of the most famous calling, and the entertainment is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Here's my idea.
That the city, in the end, is scared, and in some way addressed as a solution?
Well, it's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The vastness, the people, are all encouraged to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the product PIB, no, the city, a mechanism.
The city works and solves the greatest question of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A huge mechanism that transforms, different interests.
How many individuals from stories?
Instead, the city managed to thrive magically, based on regions with different objectives, regions, also in Italy, even bigger, that if we decided to go on a trip together with a self-light system all day, instead, the city definition is no longer a static definition, what?
Maybe in this moment, after thousands of years of history, they have temporary suspected this ability.
Others, perhaps neglers, may you consider that, right now, in some moments, or in some periods, they may be.
This virtuous mechanism, and then we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to move from mechanisms of the human phenomenon to mechanisms and tools that develop development and give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the last years and that they are not afraid of the human phenomenon, but what?
But try to feed this mechanism.
Sparating the grass, with utopia and courage, the first example is Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From these satellites, and some of them were evident, not all of them, but a group of green, unknown in the center of the city, ten minutes per meter, from the man.
That was my idea together.
And that's also the trip I've been doing for years with this map, going back to the city.
The idea is...
And to name this group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
This is how the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbital stage that each day can walk, as it does.
Being an example?
To see the city maps?
And can you imagine?
as an element of diversity and strength, believing in the positive things of the systems in which I say.
Don't let us go.
Sure, we say...
To fight.
C: It has to touch INPS.
Affic, Gettorica, still novoking.
But first of the lack of solution, cities like nurses.
What pelled, the cement?
But I don't know if you all have these spots in mind.
The second example is now that.
It's thousands of kilometers like this.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina it's the capital.
And it was put in a quesit for a few years.
What can we do with this city in 2030 with all of them happy?
Buenos Aires, more than in other years.
The country is the magnet.
But from all over the nation, the place where ...
Everyone sees a chance.
Mamm.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed you.
Who has somehow obsessed?
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
Limitate development, and it's now courageous.
Sparing the bass, with the same ability.
Incredible!
Well, in the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do development accelerate and see comics?
The play of intensity, that is, a huge population.
Anger in breeding.
It's the creation of...
If you pedonal or glasses, do you see?
This one.
It's adolescence.
Piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in much more life.
To build.
Stituting third parties with more densite rooms.
Changing ...
But the population not only of Argentina, but from all over the world is creative to get together.
Then we build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
Slowing.
That allows us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
One of the social spaces.
I'm peaceful!
Diver and pedonals.
It's this tragedy, fight together.
They were about the development of Buenos Aires, about science?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Ciao!
And by choosing the location on the end, you will see it from thealto, this great invention of humanity.
Why is the city?
You have a different feeling in your heart and you know how to answer that question that you were asked.
BB: Tant times.
And maybe?
Happy birthday.
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
[A.DE.]
The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
They give way to our thinking: the words of our language are extraordinary, they are heard that they are full of stories of vibrations, of emotion, are waves.
They are evocating, they sound with our history.
And the beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you.
And I'll talk to you about art.
A mother to Montcante.
It's the English year, the school...
Provincial, motivated, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But it took a bit longer and I'll start to show you some Latin monks.
They have many Latins on their insign and the world's greatest universities, and they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia, in the UK, in Oxford.
G: In Chicago, in the United States.
(Laughter)
It says "goods" in their insign, not just universities, but also proudly.
They will say, in Latin, "Only rounds have a Latin motto."
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
The 15th, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not just: well!
The American Marina says, "Semper to finish, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even an announcement hasn't been dumb to be overwhelming, like NASA reminds a Latin motto to polish emissions, why am I doing it so late with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
What about this?
Exclusion: cooling.
The active.
"Yes."
Have you seen that?
And what is the recent marriage?
A physicist in the city of Rome has proven and launched by man.
from the human city.
And that's it.
They don't even understand what we should say: [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [Inglese] [
Wow, Mendyu!
But what is this foundation of bass reading?
But what is this contamination, this quote between two crazy lines that gives sense to each of us what are with the five ladies?
And one is asked.
Nice to meet you?
Because in the moment I take care of all the tourist attacks of all the cities in the world, there is no one who holds the essential thing.
Then I'll give you her name.
Let's move.
(Laughter) There is no part of it.
I'm a dogma.
(Laughter) "But then, did you have your feet?"
Let's give you a totally twistical knock.
(Laughter) We started the country.
[Inglese] The Ministry of Benicuto: beautiful, ready.
(Laughter) Not really beautiful to see, Beautiful.
But let's use English Italians in a way for the whole of us.
Well, I don't like us, I don't even like nonsense, which is the thing.
It's curious, that's it.
S: That's great.
Spica.
(Laughter) In Italian, we're talking even Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world, opposed to "Roomyangyu," Stud Zato d'Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to ten linguists.
(Laughter) The fourth most studied language in the world, neither studies have the Italian to do things: studio or because they love it, for the kitchen, for fashion, for the operation.
For art, for history, for Dante.
They don't study it for that.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, become male.
And he said, "Why?"
S: Yes.
[A.DE.]
G: The pizza.
He achieved the world continuing to call us pizza.
Here you can see the map of the maps.
And if it comes to the United States, facing the negotiation map that sell to bug or Otdoxon, it's coming from the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Why, here, in Italy, do we drink guai?
Great!
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
Then, how do you make history?
You can move the week of the Italian wine of Colombian.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Happy and plantations that sell food and wine.
I say to myself.
That's it.
Wow!
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
This is the one who writes the Italian magician in a way.
The "Luccorri Frendley," more "blem," directly from the passes of the Winter.
And of course, we understood that the stages are no more than once.
And he said, "Mommy, explain and ask you who told me."
A disorder.
Give it occult.
"I think as if it were a ...
It is a mountain study in "Goen Keny."
And no folks.
It's like they are in our job.
And the women we see in our mental births.
Why "corri"?
But you see, there are no colors.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
(Laughter) This is a publicity campaign in British Medes, in France, French, this is the same payment in Italy and English talks.
(Laughter) There are only two Italian words: the first one.
What's happening to us if the union perfectly?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call us, theinians, this: UNYOS.
Riuniance.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalian, isn't it?
We are not safe.
Well, the curious thing, why?
Oh, Fedou is palletic!
(Laughter) Italian in two: I don't like an English word.
60% of 2012 we say that this is not 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we can see it.
And who?
We have to wait for the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled with the sign, who has compiled this model of the formula, to be superior, linguistic competition.
"Your left!"
Every day, for drugs, for distraction, for conformism, because it seems model to us, because we are ortovinent.
We use a quantity of English words.
It's not necessary.
(Laughter) Not deeply, you enter the thesis of the Italian language, she has purely access and subtle.
CR: We said colors, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I heard them say, "The bucket is the "lockering" that we chose for the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
AC: In the ufficies, you can feel, we have to schedule a set of toothpaste lines unit from the face against insatisfaction.
With business it's united.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the customer service, because the unite business is always a guy, blank and journalist.
CR: In English, the e-mail, they speak it not only in companies, but also in media, public administration.
The government, we have a law from the State called Jobsect, and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't solve it more sympathetic.
(Laughter) And I forced the newspapers in Giobatt, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
And in English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
And a couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman Sea.
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To activate sensitivity into this problem: free!
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and waste, and a little bit of energy.
What about this pet?
who invented public records, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian, and the first group at the Cusca Academy, because, as a result, became the protagonist of this idea of sensibilization: we were expecting a disabled, but not what happened, in less than a month, they filmed, performing their name, with Dizzo's men, and in the same way, 70,000 people.
They have signed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spike that none of the workshops have signed up professional suppliers and have called pensioners, have signed.
Italian people in the west to say, "What's wrong with our language and they signed storing in Italy, they filmed from all over the world?"
C: From Singapore, from Jedusalem, from Pedudal, South Africa and north Africa.
In Canada, as a cost, it's something with movement: I had host.
To look at these signs that grew up, we could read the motivations.
And we could make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a dober, we are in the soap opera, if we think abundantly, we'll talk about another etangoscodetically, working in a public recording, support.
"Film, because I've studied classic studies, "Goda the work with economists."
Later in fashion, I've received a prize of answer, it's not for the unexpected and the trend, I don't think it's going to happen.
(Laughter) A good Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Sisher.
(Laughter) And we know what we're wearing AND.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Tchung, go Rome's food."
So it starts to let me talk about our language decence.
(Laughter) Why can't you ever say, "Hey, it's funny that splend this?"
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, Beijardi, Bernata, I'm surprised to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bubbles, but they reinforce Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We hear because I don't believe that those who say "cool" is "cool".
But the movie, because I've heard of it, the universities that say displegated, instead, that they visualize.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old, thanks for engines.
That's it.
CR: As I said, an extraordinary ecosystem transversing, because in mass communication, they imprisoned this thing from zero cost, connected.
And does not amplify it?
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the stamp on the dispubblic side, but the gathering with great applause, also in Italy and welcome area.
He talked to me Wired and talked about Vaniti Feer, and he talked about Christian family.
He spoke to me about the Mexico of Turing, he has spoken today that behind him made a publishment: azensity.
Why?
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with awareness and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in interactions, it also touched me to put myself in the city, and I was interested in an Australian radio, a lion.
That's it.
We need that.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate then the Italian helped us understand and it's a fact of democracy, because it makes us understand a fact of democracy.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the institutions to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, it's a factor of more emotional, we need to sell the spiral, bring it to the world, because it represents us.
And you know more crazy, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful: he also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
(Laughter) In English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten, and so the one who talks about how he manages, spoke better.
And then, this duty is lit.
FDB: On the first of the talks of these days?
The messages that defined this sign.
S: Homo Sanzalitter.
Because he scratches in volcano, in Italian.
(Laughter) Since always, structure, the way of decency, the Italian language, helps us express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
We resign one of those pecurialities.
One of its successes.
(Laughter)
That's our potential.
Specifically, Italian creativity, which is the ten in your mother language.
What's more, if our linguistic status is strong and used to it, we can attach some term strange, why personality?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
In a sense measurement, we must have an excess, a finalist, or a misuse.
But why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, in Italian.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
And our opening towards the world that goes through our words, in reality.
It's to be a young Karghiver.
And when does a guy look bad?
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
But if that person, even with something that doesn't happen, is your mom, obey.
What happens?
What happens to you if mom to mom or her parents?
And I started to see if still a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the hardest idea of being a youngster, like everyone went to school, I ran and got married with my friends.
But what's behind these photos that you can't see?
I'd like to tell you about the naked part of the iceberg.
I'd like to take a step further and re-encounce...
And always at the beginning: if I asked you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother to the center, to my adulthood that I'm currently passing through my teenager who you see without record?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called the health problem, and when one in two parents hits, and you still have a child, a teenager, they are your reference points.
It was really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
Fairy for a child can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harm, fear, fear, rage, sadness, love, hate that they alternate, vortically, the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
It's the difficulty to focus.
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the bizzious behaviors that your surroundings may have.
But, along with this, I could really manage your emergencies for which no one has prepared you, how to manage the situation while your father or your mother saw many things that are not psychologists.
Or to have to do with alternating in a gold and depressive way, without anybody who has prepared to do it, or even wishing, setting up, the treatments of suicide.
But in addition to all this, we also had to keep going all the time, going to school, studying, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another character, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your good mother, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you, as a genetically committed and destined to automatically, or if there's no diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mommy, man, something that doesn't go, the answer of the eternal world will be completely different."
Today, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect.
Nowadays, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a rite to understanding what happens inside you with your own affection, a rite to ask and receive opportunities that are often not being able to receive a cure.
And for you, if your children, the load becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the neglect, can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside fear, rage, and pain, and to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time, there was also a result of help, a result of help that couldn't allow us to go out, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
And when the first grade started an extremely beautiful at that time, when, for the first time, the light began to filter, remember again when the psychologist of the family council, who was the first person to trust family.
The one I've been able to open and that helped me, on the piano, is to see people sitting around me the strength that they could be supported.
But the truth and the right "good water" was for me?
Later on the Internet on forms, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to love for the crazy things that had brought me to the trips.
But the stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
And you know why it happens, because of our children's stories there is no one who has lived the same things we've lived on us, but it's statistically impossible, in the world we're millions of people, and yet we've tried to see it, that there's no other who've lived the same things we've lived on us.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada.
Not only could I give a name to the emotions I had experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I had experienced, but I could also see the positive characteristics that were born to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path by myself, and I went to see in Canada, for the first conference I changed, I saw those positive characteristics, to talk to them, but also to write, their view, the pain, but also the ability to transform that pain together for someone who didn't recognize me.
The encountered me was an owner, an huge owner.
That still brings me energy, and it's an owner that I strongly visited in Italy and in Europe to help other empty features, other children forgotten to be able to take off their couches.
The wish is that no child, adolescent and young adult, should no longer feel just when one in the business starts to suffer from a psychic disorder.
It's an immune desire that needs access to everyone, because other measures, as I can't even feel before caricating the weight of the world all on my shoulders.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2010 that they don't have a voice, to start the first Italian association, created by children for other children, to give voice to children guided to all consultors and sedentary centers of Italy, because no child left alone, and also their mental disorder, and even these kids must think, I was one of them for a period.
And initially, when I thought about this project, I was detailed: I will never make it realised, how will it do?
But on the piano, I asked to help people around me, also to the scursionists' guides, proposing to tell them during a trip in ten minutes the story, and to find these people in the civil society who may not have experienced this experience, who wanted to become our positions in the change, and bring a family of the need in our own owner, to the community library.
And now we are able to reach so many regions, from the open beach, until the Sicily, at the Sardegna, we don't stop it, we want to reach them all.
Another wish we have is that, I mean, to give up the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
And the other huge desire we're realizing is that of meeting schools, talking to the students, not only the schools, but all of them, to be part of the actors to face those that are positive and negative emotions, the faces of life, leaving markets, even if it's too bad.
To save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
Let's learn that positive, that parents' children with mental disorder we have, is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that these young people will make their desire happen, even thanks to you, and it's the will to change light, thank you.
And today I want to talk to you about a specific person: Aaron Sfarz.
When they dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014 the year of the Internet-boy wastested, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, it's easier but to make a list of projects he collaborated with, ten and decades.
Four years ago, they were in a group that wrote down, maybe you don't say much, but it was ugly in the fridge until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today, Creative Commons are around a part of contents, they are free licenses, they make the most accessible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something called a reddit, becomes a millionaire from one day to another; they proved, honestly, they didn't take so much money, famine, they continued to do what's always done to build an open and collaborative Internet, and become one of the protagonists, even in Wikipedia, to be a monopoly.
To go to play-out because it limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years ago, all the tasks of computer education revolved with the capital of March under the arm at 16 years.
And this is what I tell you about her fridge, in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn how highly: he tells his mother that, at some point, she was staying there, and aaron was two and a half years old, he was sitting in that fridge and the vision on the fridge, that she had just attacked with the calams.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at Aaron's projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies for access to information: the HIV internet preserve memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, which allows blogs to synchronize and creativity, so they make access to people of content, creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental element for banality, which means that power information, access to information is born from an extremely simple point in universality.
Power information comes from Mility, as well as Montessori, which means giving access to information from people mean...
It is to make a democratic act, our democracia democracy is based on giving access to education, without this, there is no dismissment.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
Aaron came to this genius which he is, this came from his cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker, not as a hut, not as a hut.
When you know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
Everything becomes accountable at the moment we know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this with it: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become a monopolic act, but you become a building act.
[A.DE.]
Circa, in 2011, Aaron is interested in this thing called Open HACS, a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many great editorials have the keys of power making scars what scares isn't, that is, the scientific information.
And I said, "There were...
It's interested in this subject, scratch this thing called Open Hux, Guerrilla or Penacks manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy; the first ones were power information.
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
And it's supported.
And AFBAI had taken care of it, not an act of this genius, it's probably not going to look at it.
It means that your opportunity to make Aaron an example, you want to give a small example to show all hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a set of rules.
That's how the aromine is made of a veracity and its technical persecution, to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats, and it could do it, but not in this scenario, and they've been answered informal Pyramatic atts, up to 35 years.
It depends on millions of dollar in this legal cause.
And he is equipped, neither more, he saw a terrorist.
QD: Two years later, her first subscription, an airlands at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently.
FdB: With Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure styles, people who wanted to give access to information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last week of aron-sfarts, a few months before dying.
S: I think it's a problem for everyone.
I needed to do a store.
[A.DE.]
Tantenio!
But he also sent all the tickets to watch.
Without all this, how it's designed, then we have to do this.
(Laughter)
Tantenio!
And what about it?
You have seen a bit of prosecutive: E39 is Streetland of Streetland, Spotlight, E39 is Spotlight, E39 is a more important thing.
Let's do it!
And INESDAN is a nice financial side of mine, it's still a merit, and there's no buster, in boys, learning, in Zaptares, and in Brig.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
But there are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
The mass spioning platform is used for...
To spy, to check, to express, but there is also another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, liberal, a full space, freedom of expression; in fact, these things are equal, they are too complex, to be just one thing.
And aron says something important: Zappy tales depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I don't have them, but with words of someone brave, and to make experiences, it's not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here.
The hell we live every day, which we form is together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
The first achieved many achievements is to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore, the second risky requires attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and making it last and putting them inallel.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Then in 1950.
It was a while eating with some physical bonds in the back of the lab of Losalamo.
But in I was closed, improvingly, I solved the eyes of theattoo and it dominated.
Are all here?
And he didn't talk about the other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
He wasn't mindful, no, he had made a reason.
Behind, in our gallery there are hundreds of thousands: most of them are closer to our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years, our Sun, the Earth has 4 billion and a half.
Then, if life appeared on another planet, around one of these very ancient stars, so very first.
This is what we can see on Earth, in the galaxy, as intelligent species, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, compared to us, we've never been told in any of these intelligible civilities.
And here's the question to close, I want to say, "Where are all how many?"
It's one thing, in other words, that can create some curiosity, it can disrupt, and, effectively, over the years, it has become many more simple, it's that there's no one out there, that we are alone.
So, this is possible, I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, before or after, in life, I least do it as always, when I was a child, I kept a stunned sky, and I asked myself if, around those bright bright bright parts, could be living beings, which, perhaps, in that moment, were keeping in my direction, outside the Earth, would be an epocentric change for our species.
It's also for the understanding of the place we take in the universe.
Four centuries ago, the Copernican Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, a seventh and half ago, Charles Darwin, has explained that our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, actually we come, and we all split from a paragonable unit, perhaps even better than the other two.
To bring.
Well, in the last years we have certainly made many steps forward in the vocation of a possible answer: we still don't have an answer, but we are the first human beings.
This is one of the biggest characteristics of astrophysics in the last 20 years, 20 years we would have been able to suspect it, that there were other planets, potentially, to understand many things, to understand, for example, about a change of gender, because they're incredibly far away, and they're separated from us.
From an ocean of green space, the universe is truly very big, and then I'll give you an example, a particular example: this probe, my shoulders and you, generally, is the space framework built by the human that has become farther away from the Earth.
It's on a quarantine of years' trip, and it came to the closest conclusion of the Solar System, and it entered the space in testing, and it's aleating from the Sun to a peaceful speed: 60,000 km later, 17 kilometers to the second, so a huge speed, but given, how much this would fit.
And the fact that we have now is time, so we're also talking about time, but also the light that travels to the speed is used in nature, in a sea in a sea in a sea in a vast space, more than four years to make a response to the interrogative of wounds that later the interrogative in reality that we all have, where all of us are, and so it's very complicated, maybe we're not alone in the universe.
And I use an example of the writer John McFi: the distance between the tip of my hand's pairing and the tip of my hand, which is the transcender time between the formation of our planet, the Earth and today, four billion in the middle of years.
Very good.
And then these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, they replicate, differentiate, thanks to natural selection, evolution and only here.
But at the dust of the hand to the side there is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complied to a life of billions of cells, the animals, the tools.
The dinosaurs appear here.
At the end of the palm of the left hand, and at the beginning of the last speech, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely to the impact of a great asteroid, to space them from the land together with three quarters of living species at the moment of the planet.
And the combinations of these peoples, big ones, have been many times throughout this long history.
In life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet have been stressed.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history of the life revolution on Earth was a long, difficult, accidentated path, governed by unbelievable events, and that so I didn't have to bring the origin of the most complex organisms to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens species, which is, in all this, where we are.
It's the whole history of humanity.
It's at the end of an ugly: we could hide the road completely with a Lima's harp.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
If one day, as I wish, we found out that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms, the first extraterrestrial ones that could be a simple battery, the pregnancy could be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be rare, and even their existence could be significant, incurable, compared to the times of the universe; maybe they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes they added a certain level of technological progress, to self-alimentate, or simply, they imploy with the audience, they spark, without leaving any stage.
Life had to overcome a large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us, in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, to our species.
Behind, from far away, let's imagine ourselves coming from another planet.
Well, if we think about them, probably in the universe, no one would ever realize that we were.
We are a very young species to confront and to overcome the problems that we will find in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we will continue to discover wonderful things in the universe, maybe one day, life.
On some other planet and maybe in a far away future, even if we can reach other stars, then, if outside there are super galactic intelligences, as you can see in fantastic films, then the only hope to be part of it.
The problem of the claim, of these galaxic intelligences, is to survive as long as possible, we feel hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
And then I believe that even more we have the obligation to keep access until we get to this.
I think it's wonderful, filly of consciousness, sorry for example, in a small planet that's lost in the spring of the cosmos.
KP: The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport made of Vitoria.
Not from the sport that has come before classifies, but from the done sport and generates positivity and positive things for others.
A sport that may be -
And then, when you believe you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
CR: I'm here, in this photo, I'm running, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia, during the first cover of a lungh trip, a trip made of 104 kilometers that later became a hundred, adding two, because Centro Quattro was another coconut.
It's a number that will come back much longer.
This is a long story.
What about us?
I'm the end of those 116 Chileans with all of us.
The runners, instead of running, are instead of being worried about the world.
To get the first or to come to the last ones?
But we were all together, after these 1006 Chilean agonies.
And the journey is the first difficulty.
But right now, during the first days, we were terrified to Windoc.
It's up there, inside the map, and after six hours of traveling, it's enough.
And the difficulties we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance.
And the petitoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number I still know: this Saturday I know is an important number, it's an important number.
For me.
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a night cover, a cover of 15 Chileans, so it's very simple, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
But we do them during our attitudes.
But the desert is in general, the race is a bit like the metaphor of life, you begin to do things.
Later, the unexpected things happen in life, and even in the dark, the unexpected things happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, or if it's time, or if it's time.
To do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the chance.
AD: You react.
And I had the first difficulty to have him after three Chileans.
Thank you very much.
S: Yes.
Actually, I couldn't bother.
I couldn't bother because at this station was associated with an important initiative of Foundisinga, an important initiative to pick up basic income for the fight against the important Foundisinga's important initiative, at Roblastoma is a tumour.
It's a childhood tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, me before that experience.
And when it's in the desert, it's complex to run in the desert, because there are many many many, that are still in this moment bad, and so my goal was to do these 116 Chileans regulating sources to give hope to these children.
Very calm, in Namib's desert, in December, high internship, it runs at 61 grades, during the marathon of 42 kilometers, which is lasted as long as it takes 7 pm.
I've had various problems, brains, matches, scriptions came in this way, why should we move forward?
When it's correct, or nearly, this was at the beginning of the second cover, that slightly lighter, becomes a km, so nothing dramatic, but it was a beautiful cover, a cover that started.
To make me think, a magnifying glass that started to appear even the seventh of the ground, the heat, right?
What's in a desert?
And the desert started and taught me so much, he taught me that we often are to be.
And we also feel during every note.
Build, during all our workplaces, inhabitable places, we feel inhabitable, we feel.
A lot.
But unfortunately, in the desert you find out that you're a punch, it's a cast, maybe where you arrive around you and I run around 15, 20 km where there's nothing.
And when you run 15, 20 km where it's arrived, there's nothing.
You realize how small we are and also teaches you that things of a beautiful life.
But they are not just cellulare, or the final dress, absolutely many youths to be happy must have a cellulare, no, at the same time.
And there I learned many things: from a man who was guiding a bus on a lemon, and at some point in the desert a night we went to eat and stood.
It depends on the pulmine, there was scens.
In this desert, it's going to take a sheet of paper, which means the door to this warning, and it tells us, "Yes, you've used it, don't use this wake."
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, teach.
And I don't know if you know that with salary I also do medicine, he was happy for the abuse: now we don't have to be happy, probably only for the abuse, it's fair to be happy.
So many other things, but it's also important sometimes to valuate how fortunate we are.
The anamibian desert is the desert I chose because inside the Nanamibi desert, there is the highest doll in the world, more than 300 meters long, and when you're here, we've made it all over the mountain, which then split from the other side, is as if it touches the sky, because the desert does not exist, it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist.
So, when you know it at the top, it's an amazing thing.
Sharing on Duna is not easy, I ran little, I walked a lot, and when I arrived at the end of the owner, I was already in Chile, there were only six Chileans.
And we're already in Chile, and which also corresponds to a girl.
It's a pack of the world here in Namibia, and I've done it now.
[A.DE.]
Sorry, Marancan.
(Video) Louis Demis, 4 km/h of 3D factor.
C: For me there, daddy.
"Why am I walking full, I'm happy?"
Audience: Yes.
So, thank you all that you're wearing strength, you see, you're wearing hands.
(Video) Ricardo Chiaretti: Vado, go, I love you, I don't get it.
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when the city, in this morning, talked about the small principle of my well-being, and I found a lot of people who shared with me, other than 26 people, because it was a motorbike garage.
With many contents: 96, we were in 96 people who had lunch with me, in the end, the last 2 km could also not do them, why?
The challenge was 104.
A long time ago, and at the beginning, a magic came true.
Then you can see them were all very humiliated during the score, because the horses...
CR: It was a bit difficult.
So this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed that stern.
To give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician seas, you can go backwards, do the other Chilean, you can go back toward.
To get to 1006.
Why the project?
He had the goal, I mean, to reach these childs' bells, to have the inside, the number is, always, important and recurrent, the interesting thing that we got to the end.
And the funded recipe?
The melted data has completed its goal.
On December 20th, 2016, if you take the figures, it's exactly the figures that make 116 km, or 16 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
But I wasn't very sports.
I have to move forward.
MM: When did I have another captain?
But do people rifle?
And surely, it took 100 meters.
And I'm already doing it.
"Ah! I don't know
I wasn't alone.
Look.
(Laughter)
Besides having a wife that is enough, I had two children, a little older, Riccardo, who is already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
(Laughter) And Pietro, Riccardo here, during the school day, so three years difference, this is the first day of school, and nothing, Riccardo where to go to the fourth and Pietro, in the first elementary, so big, I don't know why Riccardo did Police in his bread, I don't have life.
[A.DE.]
It's a bit like the race, what I've just mentioned before, in the end, the fat, sometimes you should know how to react, and that's what happened, this is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage, the photograph of a celebrating epidemic, unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage during November, during the first days of school, and this celebrating hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malform that we didn't know during birth.
And it has lasted hardly, and this is the last time I see it smiling.
(Laughter)
But when did it look?
When it seemed like everything was right, February 18th.
But in 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too crazy, okay.
So ...
The garage is called Ranna 1006 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
And then ...
Surely not me.
I: No, no.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
Wow!
And in these moments?
But you don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
Antonia.
(Applause) Continuing?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Continuing to dare not to give the strength to those who are upset.
Because remember that the problems are always the ones who stay.
And in Riccardo, keep moving forward in life and give the chance to the other two that arrived: Emma, has never arrived on January 29th in San Pietra.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and anchus couldn't drop me, so absolutely, what did I have to do?
Keep going to create or improve my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say this visually, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people strength, right?
And to be me, stronger, and so I started running the first image I saw on record.
I ended up arriving in the desert of Namibia, where, since these 16 Chileans brought me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you can see the label, those symbols I have already done it with adds, and it will continue to not run by itself.
Let's see, let's wait until the end, but the desert is different, but the goal is always the medal, that is to get the money to help children and help them do better, and the message so that today is an important message.
Anyone is.
The difficulties we can have, big or pictures that are, there is always a hope for everyone, to do a lot of things.
And to move forward.
Because life is a bit like we have a bottle, right?
And today we are here.
And today it's 17/6 of 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it.
