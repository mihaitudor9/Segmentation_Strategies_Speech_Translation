(Applause) Are you there?
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words that are apparently so far away: Be, you must know that, until some time, my two largest children, Mars and French, in order to sleep, they chose two words.
And I had to tell a story about those two words.
Now these things don't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon, but intrappolated from a terrible incarct.
The words were fatal to get out, they were just blocked in their pockets.
Anyway the years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the balls, he is so much that proves to meet psychologists, logopists, all his brave professionals, but no one gets there.
To take this incase.
One day, I traveled to Rome, and just for pure fortune.
There was a little town called Teresa.
I said goodbye. I said goodbye.
And this little girl says, "Daddy."
When?
One day.
I will reply to a child.
Anything happens?
Not to be afraid.
Everyone around me said "Madre Teresa," but what a beautiful word of freedom?
Instead...
The young man thought...
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
Anyone!
They were still in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
So he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the wish of this young man to try the potatoes he wrote, the potatoes were too big, and he didn't think about it: graders of the psychocenic, he picked up the microphone and said, "Salva todos, they're a computer engineer, they think they're so brave in the internet that my first words as I was born are web, web, and there was this way people would laugh."
And he was happy because the words used fluid in the air.
It was succincting a magic.
It was successing an extraordinary thing, but the most beautiful thing.
That young man ...
Realize at that moment that people ...
They didn't laugh anymore.
To him.
But they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
(Laughter)
And then, you've forgotten, you've talked about the fragility, but you've forgotten to say the strength, "This is a little the problem of having the eccentric dad," my mom would say, but the strength makes us, but first, I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, my debilities.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen.
In other words, they took the best of themselves.
What is a moment, I talk about my disabilities and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
It's then!
that I am a volunteer at a house that gives people with disabilities.
But how did it work?
I worked with people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've been pulling out and they're truly taking out the best part of the half.
And this thing is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Why?
Believe me: finding a disability, you can fear a little.
But for those who are a genius?
Or is it becoming a genius?
Give it.
Disability.
Well, that's it.
It's the biggest one of the paintings.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me and my wife, who is in the fifth, a physician she gives us a look at a small storm, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was a single seed, and makes my wife walk.
Take the paper and read.
It's Down syndrome.
None.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one here is that I have in my ears.
They are the words of the little boy of Calcuta.
I was failed.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, that's an obsession, but our son is a female..." (Laughter) the dotted - and that's an applause, maybe he didn't understand - trisomy 21 - it's the Down syndrome.
My wife answered, "I understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The dotter is always more spontaneous, close.
It's a feminine.
(Laughter) Then I say to myself, "Oh, but there's a misery, we don't even know what we've got to do with NELA mask, but it's dark, and the doctor we've given the doctor's thesis, because, thank you.
(Applause) We keep moving much about this, but I assure you it was obviously a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, after a few months.
(Applause) And even the most beautiful thing that have brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that it has resulted all the best people, it has become the best of them, the best of their suffering, and all the people who, somehow, find.
Now this is not the potential.
But we have noticed one thing: all the people we meet are all very informed from the technological point of view of disability, especially from the Down syndrome, we are all covered by villionists, analyses, we know everything, but very few, very few of these people have had encounters with people.
And then, let's put together some of these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook campaign called "Bone notices" and "Sound Anna", where so, without asking us too much about seriously, but not for anything, old say.
(Laughter) Or another, where she says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, as it's a hence at school," and then we set up this card where Anna says, "But it's true that you cause fear of Down syndrome, and you don't have eyes on roof, because we believe that the words also have their importance, and also because we talk about Down syndrome.
You built a small X.
(Applause) No, because I'll give you this example, because here today, to meet TED, talk to people, you've done a bit of fat, so the invitation is to make a little bit of fatal and don't prevent the encounters of disability that will be in your life, both persons, but also some people around you, a very small advertisement.
In this path, we can lose.
Because hope for us is always the ones to get us: a grader on the Internet.
A blow clock under: Here, to wake up the eyes you have to put yourself at the same level, and in this sense it captivates me a lot of times of losing, that's why I like a politician to leave briefs behind my stories.
Well, I also did this sera with this sign.
That in sign language is the word disability.
So I don't need to enhance you to try to trace disability.
In your life.
To clarify it.
And most importantly.
Remember?
The pause.
What can you look at the face?
They become brave, really thanks to the heart.
I thought that to make the revolution occurred to be a particular person, like maoce, who sees or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple and simple way, changed my life.
And I understood that my mission in the world was actually not born for a bunch of bees, nor for a romantic disorder, as they told us about some speakers before, but for an orchestra, it went well, it could go further, because it was my mission in the world, it would be no longer dare to find out.
And try to make the world a little more sustainable, just leaving food.
And why food?
food?
And not only that, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food choices of each day are usually part of our daily environmental impact, if we want to translate it with an index we could talk, for us, for our family, every single day.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if we don't have the perfectly aware of the choices we make every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
My word of ordinary is one, and it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, I say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
It's also about consumers, optimizing consumers, and especially the way in which we create the behavior every day.
So, theattoo, what are we really wearing the table?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
The scary, so the less noble part, is, in average, 50% of the raw materials, so what it means is to optimize in the kitchen is to change food, that is to use 100% of the raw materials, but it is not to have a different approach, to see all these parts as a whole.
Let's take an example with the window: "I see the mouse as ..."
Okay, a candle, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, poup?
Perhaps I've made some chips, but I could also like that naturally, make us a cut, a cake.
And it's also the part that contains more fiber, so a benefit certainly for health: this is just an example with a product that should be familiar with, but it's the thing that, in my opinion, we should apply to which each single ingredient, another practical example of a very easy technology, but that allows us to transform and value also for the treasures.
Something we all have at home is that we usually don't stop looking at and traveling, so we optimize in the kitchen for me, especially that, changing our mentality a little and seeing with a different eyes.
In particular, ants, but all the food to mirror them less and appreciate them to the maximum: optimizing also means optimizing energy heats, for example, every time I use an electronic electrodom like the vast temperature, so it doesn't occur to you just using the vast coast, and every time you've been cleaned, like it is.
A very practical example: allowing a glass like this one, you must be hermetic, let's add a new one, covered with traditional technology, another application of optimizing this time to the inact, inside your fold will be to the Gok, Sodo, according to the coal that you prefer, you choose at the base of the Gatti's mirror and not vice versa.
And really, when they could put the table, for example, the males, the protective jokes, it was a party, and it worked like this: now, the problem is opposite, we have so much discomfort, and we have a little tendency to put everyone in contact with the doppy of proteins that serves us, because it's a problem.
To change more than what is used is a waste of resources, it is certainly something that we could improve, if more proteins are animal proteins that have certainly an environmental impact.
I also have to say that riding, we can decrease our environmental impact, so I think it would be important that we all put a few less proteins in theattoo, it would be sufficient a small effort from all of you to have an important health of certainly environmental benefit.
Perhaps this thing I want you to get ready, you don't need to worry about eating enough, but not eating too much. This is the problem that, even moreover, if we do it at the global level, even in public sponsors for society, I think it's more effective to try to convince you, and more likely, taking advantage of the animals with a low environmental impact.
Those of you may be wondering, well, in the next year, Apple will also be Apple, and there are me on stage today, like in the future - I sense both the insects - I personally believe that I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you're agree with me, we're not a consumer of insects, but that, even more, we can nourish with plant scars, maybe not the ones I like the auto-productive.
I'm a Gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who among you has never eaten lumps?
Okay, who would never eat them?
See?
Probably, ten years ago, this number would be inferior, we had more foodmals than 35 years ago, a law that prevented us from collecting them, and we were also a chef, enough to know how to do, to celebrate your lungs at home, just a small packaging or a gold, a little bit of land, a retina, because they were used later for the cost and for the other to use.
As simple as that, I'm a very optimistic and stupid person, the French seats, or richer a stranger, less protein in the act, change the way to see all the ingredients and become revolutionary, and twice in the year you've had your roots in a primary, like an ortagger, they need a time of covering around an hour, and then you can do what you want.
And most importantly for our happiness and our planet.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Laughter) I brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six gangs, you fell from one to the other: the other has gone with ten gangs, if I give it any value from one to ten to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you launch the data of ten gangs.
I don't know: you came to this game, put up with the same or largest number of mine.
(Audience) Yes!
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
To win with the fact of ten gangs is easier.
(Laughter) But you may say, approximately, what is your probability of coming to this game?
I'll explain to you: I can read data repeatly and capture data from every victory, a possible approach based on the experience.
After 100 lights, I will realize that coming to the seventy seventh or twelve times every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, you can see that the probability of victory approaches to 75%.
(Laughter) With the increase of releases, my stomach based on the media of the succession becomes more precise: this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of the big numbers.
(Laughter) And if you had a powerful power to release data a thousand times, we can do a computer.
But your portable will be able to release 100 million data in a single second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the mathematical problems, is called Monte Carlo for this capability of the computer to simulate the case.
It's a powerful method, we can stimulate a data release, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the development of a colony of batteries of an epidemic, or even the support of financial interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematician: a pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo in an elegant way as we would be abused of the brutal force of computing.
(Laughter) To me, it's quite a way of magic.
For this reason, four years ago I started my PhD in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
(Music) Now let's put the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which I was so streamed, was disappointed after the first week of being dotted.
(Laughter) The environment of work at Uorica and exceptional, my performance, a supercomputer, semester and conferences are at the ordinary level of the day, and the two professors that follow me are of intelligence, competence and humanity, unbearable.
(Laughter) But the doctor does not belong to everyone.
The dot is extremely difficult, technological, often frustrating, and then based on innovative research, behind every winning idea, there are ten or 100 failed attempts.
But the dot can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time alone on my computer or on a statistical background.
[A.DE.]
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate, I started to teach.
That's how you think you can teach Maths and English, for the first 40 minutes I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
(Laughter) If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I had left before.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't want to answer this question, I felt strict, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I accepted my degree, I got a degree in education with university, and I ended up teaching my students how to compete with my students, how to compassionate my students, more than twenty years, trying to enjoy every opportunity.
And then, for me, it wasn't about work.
Preparing with the process is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I love it, perfectly, brave enough to compare... (Laughter) reading the students, rightly mistaken that they are, provides a continuous learning, and then there's the moment of the performance in class, it becomes a showman.
(Laughter) What about the wow?
Every time you grow, the lesson is my spettacol.
(Laughter) The gratitude of the students repeated to my full history, and I'm talking about them as much they were learning about me.
But, during the third year, there was also a specific recognition: the University of Warrick gave me the award for the emergence in education, as a young researcher.
In the cost of my doctorate, I got so many satisfaction, but this answered inside me in a different way, it was all so natural, beautiful, brilliant.
Well, in my little boy I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
That's how I talked to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, do you remember?
(Laughter) The answer I gave myself was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
This is the culture of sharing.
There are objects or benches without astrology that are sparked between more people, instead of valuing them to acquire value.
There's a concert.
Behind TED, at this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, also a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
(Laughter) What about these goods?
There is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in sharing knowledge.
My mind had started moving at the moment in which I had tried to put the lies of my students in motion.
(Laughter) In Inghilterra was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my doctoral thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the coming months, and then I decided to take my next step, as you've understood the passion of learning is great, but the university is not the only place where math and communication find to give life to the sharing of knowledge.
But we will be going to see.
We've shared this captain of my story, precisely because I think that what I've learned is shared a method to put it aside, and also passion as catalizer of our talents, and the culture of sharing.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a preparation for the graduation exam, there are more than 100 students in the classroom, and I was with the microphone, cut my three color penales, in its heart of the ear, I cut my voice down, there's already silent, I explain that the exercise is cooperated, it will allow us to pass through all the key points in the class, in a scholarship, you'll have to end the instructions.
Another man, a few seconds ago, I ask myself where he can find other exercises to prepare: it's true, we've had a little time in practice, but there's a lot of subject in the Internet, and wherever he has been written on the rear of the diagram.
But I'm satisfied, OK, I begin the show.
(Laughter) I scratch to the washing machine, but many times I encourage them to ask how to procedure, to every point in practice we put a theory element, which we repeat the stages together, someone asks a very difficult question, but I had the dinner of their testo book, they were well prepared, I had the cavity.
(Laughter) I work with them to make them take the breath.
It's a saying, come on, I invite you to get to the magnifying glass for the exam, a group of students get close, someone asks for evidence, but most of them are reassuring.
Behind, my last student approaches me.
I'm solved.
He learns to speak, it seems harmful, maybe he's looking for the words the same.
And finally ...
It was too courageous, just to tell me.
Stop.
But I just want to tell you, thank you.
(Laughter) Why what do you do for us?
I don't do it.
That maybe I'm only in the classroom, it's a huge smile and a bigger heart, and I think, it's exactly what's in my place to this world.
So, this is what I want to say to you: mind and heart are worthy, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside your belly, your mind is core in movement, thank you.
So Dario to Mosca, in Trento, we held the research, we put baskets, and supplied by the action of Bafco's support, the vents of public public publications for massive health programs, and they start to grow baskets, finishing with already giving the song to the prostate, in more than 21 countries.
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
CR: In the United States, I was doing some Master's campaigns, and so a little Jesco saw in a bar, I wrote a book.
It's like often a captain, while I read and while doing something, started to make me some of the others, started to listen to different conversations, there was in front of me a sympathy that was talking about change.
It's a central topic: Samatina my colleagues invited him in a very clear way.
What is interesting about the change is that, as the law has already said before.
We all face the change as if it were the normal thing, they tell you that you should change, that it's normal, that you should do something, but in reality, when everyone approacts the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
And I felt your diversity.
If you feel diverse, you feel far from the objective.
I know that in this change there are many people involved, there are so many people with different intelligences, each of them has more intelligences, and you're there to measure and say, "Well, now what do I do?
(Laughter) It seems that from this aspect of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, it doesn't know itself to practice, and the opportunity appears right now, instead of diversity, which is how to integrate?
All that has brought a different look, remember one day my daughter: Carola.
It's a mom, we had a family of older friends, so at some point the machine says, "Dad, but because Alessandro Luigi is two men, I say, "Of course, we are really three men" and says, "No, they both love each other."
And then this diversity, in fact, is exactly the right thing.
To do something different.
(Laughter) I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response.
This is the difficulty, but, if on one hand you want to create a culture of change, on the other, you need to create change leaders, that I've worked for many years in companies, today I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
Then, when I'm driving this idea, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States, writing on a paper, the word change, using this word change, I start to think that I'm wearing, I don't know how many ears and start putting inside other words and forming a hatred confinement.
[A.DE.]
Great!
that in reality is a prison, it's a bit of achievement that, for me, of course, is a prosthesis of personal entirety.
A leader today must have, that means you must know how to stay, you must know how to drive, but to be present and lead the change: the hunger is an act, it's to know you're creative of transformation and change.
But what is the new setting here, at least for me, the new income?
It's exactly in the dimension of not only change: we're often called to manage change, in management.
In fact, what happens to us is, instead of doing something else.
And then, the prosecutive is the change of prospective that ...
And in this being there is a transformation that has also transformed you, who has also inspired me, it's not that I'm a project, I'm paid on the project, but what transformations are carried out, and all of that I do, thanks to what to do things, to fulfill good things, I'm a bit of leading them to change this transformation.
(Laughter) Because doing this, if it's true that I work on me, on the other hand, but I have the permission to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we've already imagined it through five.
Filater fundamentals: the first one would know about transforming, transforming means...
Nobody is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of the workshops, rather than communication, but creativity is something that affects everyone, from the environment in which you are in.
(Laughter) And if that is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can integrate your creativity, simple, stormine, we have started with a tunnel, brainstorming, and this is one of the tips that allows you to fulfill your creativity, what you do with the divergent and convergent thinking, but this is not enough.
Doing a slightly deliberate movement, right?
So, starting to involve what motivates the part, the emotional frame, the frame of emotions, we heard of emotional intelligence first, here are those, when you know about your emotions, you can allow you to support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And the interesting thing is that to do this.
It's not that you remain indifferent to the conting, which means that you don't make a change of leader who've done these tests, just to suffer in a camp, certainly deserve marriage with Rome, but at the same time, even those like the world's universal high-sension magician, for innovation and is growing up to 67 feet, that means what?
FdB: Transformation winds.
They keep thinking, like saying, inside, but they have an impact on the environment in which you operate, and so the third point is precisely to work to create in a responsible way.
Opportunity, we say in management, create the climate, but I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader.
To identify that with their behaviors they can create.
Something that has a concrete impact inside organic contexts, what does this mean?
To nourish is to say that every day you build the environment where people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spiral, they can interact with each other.
But they can also allow us to make mistakes, and that's not always the case with organizations, because there's always the balance of the results, as if the results were all gathered in one way: on the other, but, dare!
Is it an opportunity to build a climate with its own actions?
I also had the opportunity to do that, to exploit new ways.
And to do this, it's not so mediated, so I don't know why we grow with an imaginary spirit, I ask a child to imagine something and then do it, if you ask an adult.
Well, there's a simple competition here, but they say it or don't say it, the drawing I've done may not be the most beautiful, better than I say it, better than I'm in silence, and this dialogue begins, and what's interesting when we get to this situation is: "How am I doing?"
It allows me to collect creative spirit.
It's here.
The impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact, that necessarily ...
It doesn't happen if it doesn't make an organization, even if it's about reinventing a very customer relationship, because the prosecutive is completely changed, then, to return to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
To make a paradigm, change our paradigms, or what?
To be aware of the situation.
To argue the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a deliberate way to say in which way today I can be curious, in which way today, spinning for Trento, looking at the people who are here, I can cultivate my curiosity, my imagination, in which way, by looking at people, I can find something that is not that strangered.
So the sense of attention we have seen in the video is like saying: love is the way to develop creative thinking, but this assumes clearly.
The courage, on the one hand, is to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but especially that of creating a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give permission.
To make things happen, first inside of you.
And then out, in a few words, the courage to use, thank you.
But we're landing.
Let's turn off the belts of security.
How many times will you be captained?
And it's the only time I have the chance.
To see from above.
The most incredible, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
of the man.
The city.
And it's also the only time that you surely have thought: how is it possible?
What million people?
For thousands of years?
Imagine these places to be together, as far as possible.
They can live not all separated, but together.
In what we call cities.
And are you ready for the forehead?
An important question: Is it positive or negative all of this?
But would it be better to enhance this phenomenon?
Or limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, actually this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest city and most populous city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe there's no money in this city.
That's it.
What we do.
The longest process of history.
With the most experienced sentence.
And the process?
Clearly, the process of the city.
And these two kids started, and then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were treated by Manchester.
They didn't see what now captain you when you did your weekend to New York or Parigi.
Imagine.
They were stripped, without daughters.
Besides, it's a bucket.
Following, but not today's true smoke that was indeed.
that carbon parks also prevented one with the other.
And of course, both write with the book.
It was called "the conviction."
The classroom operated in the city.
In which the cities of all the bad guys in the world were the city to be due to inequality, insecurity, poverty, all the bad guys in the world.
And there was no other way.
limiting this phenomenon possible was how to say.
S: A bad suffering.
One thing I would need sometimes, but to contain, and from that?
Throughout the years, we are from 1850, at the beginning of Novecent.
There were also tools to limit this phenomenon, which was likely the cause of all the problems of the world.
Sciences are born.
Arbanics.
What do you see here behind?
One thing ...
The tremendousness that, maybe, some of you have heard about, which has bizzy tools: one called quite a service, which is the rock for which, when you changed it at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then ...
The planning, the piano, is the idea that there is someone from the past who can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only him is on his forehead, or even in the end, the Zonization that fortunately you haven't met all, but who has even managed to say?
And to imagine in a centimeter of the city, what should happen in the future, here a house.
It's a feffice.
It's a theater.
And then!
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that resonates a lot against the city.
A famous film, a series of films in the 80s went from New York, from Los Angeles.
Do you know Manhattan?
It became an incontrollable slide.
A city full of violence?
And of being thrown, so much to drop it.
Maybe because you've seen the movie, do you remember?
It has a prison where all the world's challenges are launched by the upset and can be scanned for you.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all the processes, this leads to adventure a little lungar from 1845, there's a window of years ago.
The sentence comes.
"Yes."
If I'm a scientist in science, this sentence, it's a total solution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this feeling.
It is known that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
"Yeah!"
It's the solution.
All the big questions related to the human being.
The demography -
Inquination, environmental sustainability.
The security is the economic development, the work creation.
The ability?
to create.
Congratulations.
And in fact, this feeling also matches three.
Importing?
The mentors that motivate this ability, the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, you can see myallel, my photo made from the upset of my city.
The density, in other words, how many more activities, how many more imaginations can be in the same method, the more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
That is the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that such things are diverse.
That there are countries, people from all over the world, people call me the sidewalks, and also ignore the name of the most famous people.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white nightmare, where billions of people, for one night, have a carpet, a seed home, food, and gather and eat together in a sink.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Alloga!
Here's my idea: the city, in the end, suffers, and somehow addressed as a solution.
It's really a mechanism.
The city definition isn't anymore.
The vastness, the people, are all used to confront this other city for the residents, for the vastness, for the GDP, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solve.
The greatest questions of humanity.
Why is it a black scat?
A great mechanism that transforms.
I have different interests.
There are many individuals that come from stories.
from regions that have different objectives.
What if you decide to do a trip together in a car will be lit up all day long?
Instead, the city has to thrive magically, depending on individual interests, in supporting, and therefore, the city definition is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as soon as they succeed in generating a positive transformation mechanism, and so it is a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities, in Italy, as well as big.
Why?
Maybe right now?
After thousands of years of history, these abilities are temporary suspected.
Wow, maybe!
Please, may you ever consider that in this moment or in some periods?
Remember how to be.
This virtual mechanism.
And then we shouldn't be afraid of the city.
We need to pass on ...
These measures and tools of containment of the human phenomenon.
These mechanisms and tools that develop development and I'll give you two examples.
of the work I've been doing in the past few years.
And that they are not afraid.
And it's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Third!
You can feed this mechanism.
Sparating the vast!
With utopia and courage.
The first example?
It's from Mility.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From that satellite.
They are evident from some groups, not all of us.
A group of green, unknown, in the center and the city, ten minutes per meter.
What do I do?
What about us?
And that's my idea.
And that's also the journey I made.
For years, with this map, moving towards the city.
FdB: Liber, Eddy.
Don't worry.
This group of green, with courage, because it's believed in the city.
Like the urban stage, the largest in the world, 72 miles green, an orbitical stage that every day can walk, as I did.
And what?
Being an example?
To see the city maps, you can imagine as an element of diversity and strength.
Great!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Let's not leave us, let's say.
Distrugging.
In traffic reform, the ranking still occurs.
The first sentence of solution, cities like nurses.
It comes to the cement.
I don't know if you all have this in mind.
The second example is now that.
in a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital and some years ago it was made of cheese.
What can we do from this city in 2030 with all of the adventures: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
From the whole nation, the place where everyone takes a chance.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed, was in some way untouched.
Violence, poverty also derived from a higher national crisis.
And what was the temptation?
How about the sunny?
The one that...
It limits development.
And it's actually courageous.
Sparing the big, with the same.
The ability to believe in the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the case of Buenos Aires, I've proposed three strategies.
Three strategy?
What do development accelerate?
And what do you see as an asset?
A shelter of intensity, that is, a huge population.
An enormous infrastructure magician:
The creation of pedonal spaces or glasses, you can see this friendship.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030 we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million people in the city, build.
Situiting.
Later on, we would have more densic rooms.
Changing ...
The population not only of the agency, but from all over the world is creative to get together.
And then build a system of infrastructure.
Anche!
I mean, that allow us to...
I believe that even more in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned.
the spaces of sociality.
Are you spacious?
Diver and pedonals.
And these tragedies together.
They were communicating the development of Buenos Aires.
Do you know?
What about the city?
I'm the solution to all and to the world.
When?
Ancorates a time.
Third.
And Maccaki.
Sitting the place on the spotlight, robbing from the top.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You've had a different feeling in your heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked so many times.
And maybe?
Are you very proud?
to live in what I call, the section of cities.
The words are important.
They put us in ideation.
It has never been our thoughts.
The loss of our language.
They're extraordinary.
They are the voices that are filled with stories of vibrations, of emotion, of notebooks.
They are evocating, they laugh with our history.
And you see beauty of our language?
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you.
I'll talk about it in a mountain way.
The English idea: provincial and emotional mixing, often dark.
I spoke Italian words that a few years ago.
They started to become common.
But the penetration was a bit like the larvae.
And I'll start to show you.
Some negative twists.
There are many Latins on their insecutions and social media from the world and show them with great arguments: here we are in Australia, here we are a congh, and there is a Latin motto in Ghana, in Codia, Eduzia.
In Sweden, in the leg united to the Kins College of Ronda, and in the unite Oxford leg.
In Chicago, in the United States.
Harvard says "pooritas" in your insurance.
Not just universities.
Happyly.
Dichiarian, if it's in Latin, eh?
Londra has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: Canada has a Latin motto.
Kinsland, in Australia, has a Latin motto, but not only: the American Marina says, "Semper finelli, if you've always heard it in a thousand movies, the British marine speaks in Latin, and even an education there's no point to be seen as NASA."
Take a Latin motto to the missionists in chicken.
But why am I not doing that late with Latin?
And with Latin words, because if there's a big place in the world, where a Latin motto could stay.
That's it.
Follow.
Great!
From Latin.
Well!
Have you seen that?
Instead.
What is the recent marriage of the Rome city, has proven and launched the Human municipalities?
That's it.
(Laughter) What is this addiction of algae, this contamination, this quote between two crazy lights, which gives sense to each one, what are the five pallets at the top?
(Applause) And you ask yourself.
But because, when we are all the tourist patients from all over the cities of the world, there is no one who does what is required to settle their name.
I was promising.
It's no part of it.
Only to Sundays.
"But then did you have your pen?"
Let's look at the total turning point (Applause)
(Applause) A round of applause from the Ministry of Benicuto: "You're beautiful."
(Laughter) I don't even like the aglophons, the curious thing is this: "Well, we are Italian in the way completely insensitated."
From Italian speakers, we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about Italian, the most romantic language in the opposite of Rolling World.
Stoized in Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic ancestors, I know.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante.
That's why they study it.
We're talking.
We are talking about the language of angels.
Second, don't do anything.
Excuse me.
For example.
The pizza.
He achieved the world, continuing to call us.
Pizza.
(Laughter) Here you see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map that sell to bug or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
Well, if the whole world is missing.
And he says: pizza.
Because we, here, in Italy, are "wine"?
Keep here.
We change food, and we drink wai in Lucca, there's nobbit, Catania, Milan.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If there's a story to promote in the week of Italian wine, they'd say, (Laughter) why the Brazilian Resistant of New York?
Bellians and officers who sell food and wine.
Do you say that?
That's it.
Wow!
But let's talk about another Italian eccellence.
Let's use food and listen to fashion.
This is what works at the Italian River's office.
The cold color eyes, more glin, directly from the passes of the "winter."
(Laughter) Okay, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones once.
"Mommy, explain and ask you to ask me.
An act.
Hunger rings, as if it were a mountain road in Gran Canyon and it was not angry.
How much are they at our Devener?
And the women we see in ours?
They're laughing at a scene.
Try it.
But you see, there are no colors.
Let's talk about publicity, old, adertising, anywhere, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a not in Spain and in Spain.
This is a publicity payment of the medesima opening in France and reading it.
It's French.
This is the same payment in Italy, and it speaks English.
(Laughter) There are only two Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening to us if we perfect the union?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call the command, this, "I'm on the Onse."
Riuniance.
Radiots that seem catitalian, right?
We're segmented, here's the curious thing, because more than two Italians on two don't spy a word of insult.
60% of 2012 we say that it's 58 so we don't know English, we don't know it as a country, and we can see it.
(Laughter) And here we have to wait that the medical abilities of the sign that has compiled from the sign that has compiled this model of the formula are much better than linguistic competitions, and yet every day, for drugs and prediction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are self-development.
Let's use a quantity of English words that don't need.
Not deeply insert in the thesis of the Italian language, purely, accessory and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The clockery is the "lockering" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
But let's say, "free with compilation," we say "fasting" from "whiches."
In the offices, you can feel, we must create a shower of lines joining in the caste's cassette to satisfy (Laughter) with business and unit.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the clicket service, because the unit is always like that, flat and genital.
The journalism and the e-mail talk not only about it in companies, but also in media: government public recording.
(Laughter) We have a law from the State called Jobsect and I guarantee you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't make it much better.
And I've forced the newspapers in Giobatt, a rock that doesn't exist in nature, a house a little bit.
In English that we won't be more sympathetic because it has an English name.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the coming of the Roman wedding?
I find in detail that I had to do something: communicate my partner, I have in mind two, three, processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my oficina, I put them in a parade in foot, inoldete: "Ped".
To make mining sensibility about this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a single one, simply putting us a bit of competition, communication, and trade.
It's a bit of energy, this appetition?
It invites me.
Public public records, the government, the companies, the media, say it in Italian.
And the ratio, at first times, the Cusca Academy, because it was a protagonist of this idea of sensibilization, we were expecting it.
A speech of disappearance, but not what happened.
In less than a month they filmed, putting names, cognice, dizing, and there are 70,000 people.
They have been filming young people, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spray that the workshops signed up professional suppliers and called pensioners, they signed Italian people in the west to say, "What does our language do and signed from all over the world?"
Singapore, the Jalemy Aggetto, Peduda, South Africa and the year of Africa.
In Canada, in Australia, it's one thing with movement: I have spent hours.
To look at these signs that grew up and read the motivations.
And we could make you see someone: the Italian is a right, but also a doer, we are in the novel of the flash, if we think abundantly, we talk about other tangoscodetically, working in a public recording, support.
We worked because I studied Aliceo Classic, but I work with economists, (Laughter) a great Italian and an English decent, "It's going to be better than an English speaker, Sisher" and we know what we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
Storepitesa: I have a strange name, but Italian Parlian, says, "Tchunk, there's the food of man."
The first one, for those of you, began to talk about our language decence, because I would never like to say: "Steen years is funny that occasions are spilled."
(Applause) I'm for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjares, for Qata, I'm stupid to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they ripped Company's mouth, but you do, and that's what happens.
We sign because I don't believe those who say "cool" or "cool".
(Laughter) In fact, because I've met teachers and universities that say displeased, but rather visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
(Laughter) First of all, I want to understand what politicians say that ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old.
Thanks to the whole motorcycle.
That's it.
I mentioned them: an extraordinary ecoordination transversing, because in mass communication, they imprisoned this thing from zero cost, on the Internet.
The year amplified.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: they spoke together grammares and serves on the storm of the Republica, but it was taken with great applause, also, in Italy and Turkey security.
He spoke to me Wired.
And Vanity Ferd talked about this.
He hasn't spoken about Christian family, he has spoken today that behind a drag, a transversality.
What's it?
And it's stated all the social resources, a little bit of coffee and a little here.
And that you live in the depths of more than nicks and put them to the most populated ones.
And Einstein is a great wish of entertainment with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in intergional people, and it has also touched me to put me in the city, and on the Wo Andapla and Tigi, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lady.
Well, we need it.
That's it.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our speaking and our writing every day.
So the application is ...
We have all streams, the Italian.
And do you remember that?
Ultimately, some reason to do this: how to operate but the Indiana helps us understand and it's a fact of democracia, because it makes us understand a fact of democracia.
They don't want to norms, they don't want to suffer; they want to give good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language, if everything, is valuable, it's a factor of more emotional, we need to sell the spiral, bring it to the world, because it represents us, and know more lingue, we turn each lobbing.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, the most of a language, but switching the crazy one around them.
In English, above all, we saw it and easy to straighten, and so those who speak like mega, talk better.
And then, fruit tolerated you.
In the first of the interventions of this journal.
The readers themselves "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he was scratching in flat, in Italian.
There's always the structure, the form of decence.
Her Italian language.
It helps us and express our creativity, if we resign to express our language.
(Laughter) We say, we express one of the basic fears.
It's just like that.
What about her?
Wonderful!
Potentiality.
Our specifically Italian creativity.
It's the 10 in your language kills.
What's more, if our linguistic thesis is "forte," usually, can we pick up some strange words for personality?
But we need to clarify it inside a thesis that is not fully and logical.
From a silver medal to an excess.
Finally, they are not bad at it.
Why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history.
Our opening towards the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
When a face starts to look bad, attention is to the person about their needs, but if it's the person, even to something that doesn't go, it's your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you, if mom or dad or her parents started to feel bad if she was a kid or a teenager, when I was a teenager, I had the worst idea of being a young woman, like everyone went to school, I laughed and laughed with friends, but what's behind these photos?
That you can't see.
I'd like to tell you about the dead part of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back and reclaim...
Always from the beginning.
If I ask you what has changed, what is it similar?
I'll probably tell you that I still love channels, and I've changed hair, but what is the invisible in those pictures, what has led me from my mother, who you see at the center, to my adulthood, who is now passing through my teenager who saw bicycles?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bringing it together, and when one in two parents and everyone else is a kid, a teenager, they are your reference points, it becomes really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harp, of burden that warn us vorthy: fear, anger, anger, sadness, the constant feeling of walking on the waves.
The difficulty to concentrate.
And also the need to be in charge of doing domestications, of doing the thesis, of kicking fans, are the nicest lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or, being a victim of bullism, maybe because of the acoustic behaviors that your parents could have, but in addition to this, they could manage vices and their emergencies, where no one has prepared to do it, but in addition to this, they could have to manage brings, their own emergencies, for suicide.
But how do we add all this?
So I had to continue, to make my life always, go to school, study, the reason why I'm here today is that you add another goal, which is often you can't talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or Tovaban, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you as a genetically committed and destined to be automated to ereditate the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your mother have a shepherd disorder, a disorder bipolish a schizophrenia, or if there isn't even a diagnosis to describe their behavior and say, "Mummy, mum, something that doesn't answer the whole world will be completely different."
Nowadays, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity, and, even today, it's not perceived by a common good that belongs to all of us, and for you that if children, the doctor, they become even more heavy.
[A.DE.]
The weather that we perceive around you the difficulty of communicating inside the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the neglect, can lead you to having everything inside and not just say anything: how did I face the situation?
What's behind those photos that aren't visible behind that smile?
There was a crown that came to form automatically, behind which I was born a heart of ice cream that allowed me to tend inside, fear, rage, and pain, to prevent me from being the people around me, that allowed me to keep doing things from all my guetans.
At the same time.
There was also a result of help, a bunch of help that couldn't allow us to throw away, that nobody, neither in school, imagined.
When the first grade started to watch the first person out of the family, the human being of our parents with mental disorder is all different, all united, but there's one thing that has taught me that we have in common, and that we are often convinced that we are the only ones.
But it's statistically impossible, in the world we are millions of people, and yet we invite us to be one, that there is no other who has lived the same things we've experienced, and you know why it happens that our children's stories don't talk about.
But through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that they were natural reactions to what I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path by myself, and I went to an enormous owner, the desire is that no kid, adolescent and young adult, had to feel just when one in the business starts suffering from a psychological disturb because their view, the story I've seen, but also the story of writing, and it was a choir, but also the ability to transform that chart in Italy, in Europe, on the other hand, in the other conference, for the other conference that I've seen, and there was a different person who had lived.
As not to risk again to caricature the world's weight on my homes, and that's how we live today, in 2017 with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we were born the first Italian association created by children for other children, and it's called PCome, Pacco, and Novemental, the Parence, Filian.
And it's a project that has come out of low, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people close to me, some of you are here in this room now, who have grown up in this same desire, gave us the challenge to start, for parents' children, with a mental disorder.
Initially, when I thought about this project, another desire we have is the idea of another desire we have, and the idea of another desire we have, and to tell, during a trip, in ten minutes, the story, and now we are able to get to so many regions, from the back to Sicily and the Sardegna, we don't stop, we want to reach them, and find people from the civil society who, perhaps, haven't experienced this experience that has become our own positions in the change.
You can have a marriage of atoms to face those that are positive and negative emotions, the face of your life, leaving markets, before you are too bad, to save them quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
It was one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that our parents with mental disorder have is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that this young girl will make her dream come true, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open for us, and we can enter the light, thank you.
And today I want to talk to you about a special person.
Aaron Sfarz, when they dedicated a documentary last year, last year in 2014 the year encouraged by the Internet on-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher; I'll surely play a hacker in a sense of sound and an intellectual.
But it's easier to make a list for the technical projects he has collaborated for about ten decades.
Five years ago, they were in a group that read RSSSSS, maybe you don't know much about it, but it was Ubic in the framework until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today the Creative Commons are around a part of content, they are free licenses, they believe the most flexible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, I became a small start-up to build something that co-founds something called a network, it becomes millionary from one day to another; but, honestly, they didn't get so much money and fame, it continues to do what they've always done to build a open and collaborative internet library with digital memories.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the struggle against Soppa, a high school law that a few years ago has even access to Wikipedia to do monopoly, to go to play-out, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
AC: What in ARON is absolutely overwhelming is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronna tells it himself in his blog and was able to read until 150 years old, all the tasks of economy, political theory, the history of education, computer science.
He was walking with the capital of March under the age of 16.
[A.DE.]
Later, and I tell you this on the fridge at a very exciting moment of the documentary that you had absolutely seen, and had learned how to learn how to get better.
CR: She told her mother that, at some point, she was carrying out, and a Aaron was two and a half years old, she was sent in the segelone and looked at her in the fridge that she had just attacked with me.
The calamite.
But here you have an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, with its partner, and knowledge, comes to share knowledge, because knowledge has to be shared.
If we look at the projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information.
In the archive internet presents the memory, the RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS demanded that blogs to synchronize each other, the creative Commons are a copyright, so they make them accessible to the people of the content, the creative content.
(Applause)
The access of information is born from an extremely simple but fundamental point for banality, which means that power information, that we just need to think of a second, we're in schools, libraries, universities, information is literally based on giving access to information to people, that is to compare a democratic level.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
And the fact that Aron came to this ...
From the genius which it is, it comes from its cultural background, which is that of Aker, Aker, as a hut, not as a hut.
You know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
(Applause)
Reending the world a better place in the world.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made by people, so fundamentally they are culture, so fundamentally they are made of words.
This becomes accountable at the moment in which...
I got the code and knew how it was modified.
But you don't do this by yourself.
If we start the world thinks, with open access, we can all add and make the world a little better, it doesn't become an erotic act, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
[A.DE.]
That's it.
Children: In 2011, Aaron interests this thing called Open Huxas.
Great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature shows, maybe there are some universities in the room, it's an absolutely chaotic and controversial world, in many large editors.
They make the keys of power, making scarce what is scary.
That is the scientific information.
I said, "There were ...
It's compassionate to this subject, scratch what's called Open Hux, guerrilla, Open Hzens manifesto, and scratches it between the other here in Italy.
The first steps were power information.
[A.DE.]
There are hundreds of thousands of materials, hundreds of thousands of materials from an academic database, managers.
It has been scholarshipd.
And ASBAI had taken care of it.
Not a hacker of this genius, it's probably not been observed: it understands that your opportunity to do with Aaron, an account.
An example.
There are some examples that can be shown to all hackers out that the world doesn't change with a set of rules of code.
[A.DE.]
Yeah!
It comes with aromine facts of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of thousands of artists from academic floats and could do it, but not in this scenario, and of them answered at 35 years, it spends millions of hearts in this legal cause.
And it comes equipped with more nim than seeing a terrorist.
Two years later, her first treasure.
They arrived at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the alien that fits the system, well, these will display you with all the strength combined by the disadvantages around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cessimanning, Giulia Nassange, all the almost different, pure similarities, people wanted to access information, regardless of the side.
I'd like to show you now a minute for the last interview of Arno Sfarze, a few months before dying.
CB: Justo Falla, Ricky.
Giving is one of the most important things to do.
OK ... (Laughter) Thanks.
Now, all the tables will get out.
Also, as you can do, (English) I'm a very happy person.
(Laughter) Great!
"Yeah, no!
You know that the sports system is a sports system, which is a sports system, which is a sporting canyon for Craking Chong or Say.
And then, what can we do?
The line is a bottle, a little bit replaced by Messen, and it was the mercetta.
So, how do you do it?
Look: these masses are a monk of a damaged winter.
You're Bostu!
And so, after the last years, this is the first time I love football, it's not a scansion.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
There are two Internet prospectives: the Internet is accessible.
Mass spionerform is used to spy, to control, for or first, there's another prospective: the Internet, fantastic, free, a full space, freedom of expression; actually, these things are...
These are two big winds, things that coexist in the same way, the Internet is too complex.
To be just one thing.
What can we do?
Another one says something important: zapp-teas depend on us what will come, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I didn't share my friends because I didn't have them, but with words of someone brave.
Living from the living is not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live in every day, which we form are together.
Two things are there to not suffer.
And the first achievement is easy to many: to accept hell and become a part, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risky demands attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing how to recognize who is, in the middle of hell, is not hell, and make it last and give it space.
Good afternoon everyone, so in 1950 while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the reading lab of Losalamo and improvedly with the eyes of theattoo.
It's duty.
There were all how many, and he didn't talk about other commensals, he was thinking about the extraterrestrians.
It was overwhelmed, no, it had made a argument: in our gallery there are hundreds of thousands of estrellas, most of them are the oldest in our Sun, the oldest ones have 13 billion years old, our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half.
That on Earth, we could appear in an intelligent species wing, incredibly older than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages than we are, perhaps, will be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been spotted in none of these intelligible civilities, and here's the question of helling, since, there are all how many, it's something that can generate some curiosity to disrupt and, effectively, during the years, a lot of approaches were tried to answer this question.
So, this is possible: I think this is a question that we've asked all of us, how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it as always, when I was a child, kept a hooded sky.
I asked myself if, around those bright bright lights, could be planets, planets of living beings, that perhaps in that moment were waiting for my vocation, they are asking the same question, we are alone in the universe.
That our species has been learned with all the other species of the planet, and we actually come here, we all scatter from a paragonable unit, maybe even better, to the other two.
This is one of the biggest characteristics of astrophysics in the last 20 years, 20 years, 20 years ago, we could address this light of tracks of unspeakable evidence, that one of these planets is made of this atmosphere, and so we could see if, in fact, there are planets around other stars.
Thus, I hope that all of us can be testimonies at the beginning of our lives of the moment of gender, because, I'm sorry, I think it's a real change for all of us, one of the questions that we can do that, often, is done, we will find these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare religions, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us, from an ocean of fold space, the universe really is really very big, and now I'll give you an example, a particular example of the human being that has increased even more.
The Earth has been traveling for a quarantine of years, and it has reached the stars of the Solar System, it has entered the space in testing, and it's aleating from the Sun to a massive speed, 60,000 kilometers from now, says to six Chileans in the second, so a huge speed, but, well, we'd put 74,000 years away.
It's a longer time than any citizen civil society has existed on our planet.
We could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels at maximum speed consent in nature.
What prevents us in a sea of space, and then, for me, here's one of the things to be present when we try to give more than four years to do this path and the other stelle is incredibly farther than that, but we're probably feeling isolated to the interrogative of fires that later the interrogative in reality that we all have, which is where many of us are.
One example of the writer John McFi, the distance between the tip of my hand was recording and the tip of my left hand, and the time transcending between the formation of our planet and today, four billion and a half years; well, the first forms of life, unicellulares, antennas, and, in all the forms of life, may end on our planet, and the Earth, and today, 4 billion a half years.
The dust of the hand to the side is the explosion of the forms of multicellular organisms, the most complex made of a life of billions of cells, the animals, the activities, the dinosaurs appear here at the end of the palm of the left hand.
(Laughter)
In the beginning of the last speech, a natural catastrophic event, very likely, during this long history of life on Earth, it even shows that 99% of species have experienced this planet are bound, stressed.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long history, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long difficult path, and it was governed by unbelievable events, and that so I didn't have to bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, it wasn't necessarily supposed to bring to the origin of intelligence and not that could lead to the comparison of our Homo Sapiens.
In all this, where are we?
Very well.
Better the history of humanity.
It's at the end of an unghie.
We could completely break the road with a Lima's background.
And this has already happened because today we know that for tens of thousands of years on our planet have been invited to us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
And then, maybe there's a bit the key of everything.
One day, as I wish, we discovered that there's another life in the universe, it's very probable that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrials could be simple batteries, the fat can be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rare, and even their existence can be very significant, incurable, compared to the times of life, in the times of the universe.
Mags are the same intelligent species, but sometimes it has added a certain level of technological progress, to feed themselves, or simply get involved with harassment, they spark, without leaving any trace in the universe.
The great cosmic silence that disrupts us and hurts us, maybe a little bit of advertisement, maybe we are saying something: life had to overcome it?
A large number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could find it in front of us in the future, after all, we think about ourselves, our species from far away, imagine us coming from another planet, if we spark ourselves.
Domani.
Probably, in the universe no one would ever realize that we were.
Let's think of a very young species: just a few years ago we started to fly, to communicate on radio, on a fifty-year-old, we sent sounds in the space, we arrived at the residents of the solar system, but we really ended up putting the footprint in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounds us?
And I think that waking up here really would be a bit like a hood, and we, as diferencia of the dinosaurs, we have at least part the chance of...
To change, to influence our destiny, we have surely the capacity to feed ourselves, but we also have as I believe, and I hope to help scientific knowledge and technology to confront the problems we need in front of us, to guarantee a long future, to reach other struggles.
If it's out there are super galactic intelligences, as you see in the fantasy films.
Then, the only expectation to be part of the key of these galaxic intelligences is to survive as long as possible, we stay hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I think that even more we have.
The need to keep access to the end of achieving this wonderful chain of consciousness, for example, in a small planet lost in the window of the world, thanks to it.
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not of the sport made of vittories.
But not from the sport of those who arrived before classifies, but from the done sport and that generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that is likely...
Then, just believe it, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia during the first cover of a huge trip.
A journey made of 144 kilometers, which later became 100, I joined two, because Centro Quattro is ours, few, no, I don't even include two of them, because you know a number that will come back in a long time, this story.
And here is me at the end of these 116 Chileans with all of them.
All of us?
The journey is the difficulties already started in the first days: we were terrified to WindOC, which is high, inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough difficult, we arrived in my desert, the oldest desert in the world for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first cover, the first cover in the war, the first cover is a nocturnal cover, a cover of 15 Chileans all of us, we do them during our apartments, whether it's time to do something beautiful, and also in the corner the imprevists happen, but if you want to bring a challenge, a woman, you should still move forward and know how to react.
There's always the chance to react, and I, the first difficulty I have been to after three Chileans.
Calm down the sun!
(Sound of soccer) You want to do it for this ghost.
(Laughter) And, in fact, you put me ... surprise... (Laughter) I don't like it anyway!
For example, I couldn't really get involved because in this jungle was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to raise funds from the lower to the Roblastoma, a infant tumour that unfortunately unites so many children, and I, before this experience, I didn't know very well the existence, because there are so many many many many many many many many, which are still in this moment bad.
I do calculus.
The desert, or nearly, this was the beginning of the second cover, the right level of unitivity we have, but there are always 60 graders, during the marathon of 42 kilometers long, which is lasted as it's about 7 hours of rope, I've had various problems, in bracity, and scoring sent it like that, because we had to move forward, and it's true that it's also to relax the field security and the chest, we feel invincible.
And this sheet was a warning warning, he was happy, because with the warning I don't know if you know it, and I don't know if you know that with salary, I can make food, and when it comes to 15, 20 km where there's nothing, and I don't know if you know it, but with the sail, I also do medicine.
The anamibia desert is the desert that I chose because inside the desert of Namibia, there is the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters high, and when you're at high, it's an incredible thing: sometimes we feel good, how fortunate we are, and so, when you're at high, it's an incredible thing.
(Laughing) Now we're already in Chile, the City Congrocent which also corresponds to the dome part of the world here in Namibia and the real sky.
Fourth Chileans when I do more than two: (Sigh) They live the last... They've been working well, and they're happy, scused, thanks to all of you who've been giving you strength.
(Video) Ricardo: Look, there's no more.
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when stammatine also talked about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people who shared with me, other than 26 people, because it was a garage with many contents: 1996, it was 96 and 96 people who had traveled with me, in the end, the last nucleers could build magic, magic, an incredible magic.
As you can see the earth, all very humiliated during the sequence, because the leaves were a bit rigid.
And so, this is us because the organization that had made a Chilean from the back had placed the sideline to give me the chance to come, to finish the uffician cabin, you can go back, do the other Chilean to go back, to reach 1006.
Why did the project have the goal of getting to these?
In a Chilean is really in the inside, in an important and recurrent number, the interesting thing is that we arrived at the end and the money drop, on December 20th, 2016, there are exactly the numbers that make 16 kilometers, or even 16 to 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't very sports, I smoke.
We were, sometimes capita, to think about it, and I was surely 100 meters away.
I wasn't just ... scused.
Looking at having a wife that's enough, I had two children, a bit bigger, Riccardo, who's already ten years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old, and Pietro, of course, had already understood this, is the situation, but, unfortunately, life, sometimes, was observing hard things, I've never understood.
It's a bit like...
Like the corsa.
What I mentioned before, in the end, fatigue, sometimes you should know how to act: unfortunately Pietro had a celebrating hemorrhage, this is a celebrating hemorrhage hemorrhole, was caused by an arterovenous malformation that we didn't know during birth, and it loved hardly, and this is the last time they saw him smiling.
[The public sends a bathroom]
And...
So, when?
But when did it look?
When it seemed like everything went well.
Hmm, February 18.
In 2010 unfortunately, they called us and had a heart attack because it was too crazy, OK?
(Laughter) The garage is called Ran 1006 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
BB: And then ...
And of course it isn't.
I don't have it.
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
You don't have to let go.
And it needs me.
(Applause) Continuing to continue to dare not to convince the strongest strength, because you remember that the problems are always the ones who stayed, and Riccardo continues to move forward in life and give the chance to the other two who arrived: he arrived at Emma, and has never arrived on the 29th July in San Pietro.
Eventually, Michele arrived, 18 months later, so there were them, we had to be positive, and I didn't want to drop myself, so absolutely I had to do what to manage to create or improve my life, improving my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but especially from me.
From the physical point of view, to be able to give strength to people, and to be me stronger, and so I started running the first image you see on the record is my first marathon mix, the queen of seeing will be very beautiful.
I ended up arriving in the anamibia desert, where these 116 km have led me to win this medallion, but to help many children, they also needed, and you can see there the little house, which I wanted to take 21200 euros.
It's 2002 for two, because I haven't run only inside the desert and I'll continue to run by myself.
And this year in November went to the desert of Omanna and Chileans will be 165 so I got only water, we came here, we waited to get to the end, but the desert is diverse, but the opposite is always the medesimate, which is to get the money to help children and help them do better, the message so they can do it today is an important message.
It's all the difficulties we can have.
Grandes or pictures that are always hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward, because life is a bit like a rocker.
(Applause) And today we're here.
And today is 176.
From 2017.
Three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to everyone.
