Controlated.
Powerness and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what these two words have to do apparently so far away: you must know that, until some time, there are my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to fall asleep they chose two words, and me on those two words I have to tell a story.
But now this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So, the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon: the words were tired to get out of there, they were blocked in your mouth.
Anyway, years went by, the child became a man, but he suffered a lot, a lot about this problem of the fire, so much he proves to meet psychologists, therapists, all his brave professionals, but nobody knows how to get rid of this event.
One day, we traveled to Rome, and, fortunately, there was a little girl called Teresa de Calcuta.
And this little girl says, "Daddy, when one day you'll expect a child, what happens?
Not to be afraid.
It's so much that everyone around Mrs. Teresa, but what beautiful word of freedom, instead...
The child thought, "I'm not interested.
To these freedom words: I want freedom for my words.
Anyone.
There were still some years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor, and he became a computer engineer.
Because it was much easier to tell the words in front of a computer.
It's to listen to the words in front of a audience.
But one day, at the beach in his country, they were attending a big party with a barbecue and a microphone there in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
(Laughter) That's how people were laughing, and he was happy because the words used fluid in the air, but imagine what a microphone means for a globe, but the wish of this man to experience the comic ball was too big, and they didn't laugh anymore, it was a magic succession, but they were laughing with him.
So, at this point, one of my pictures would have asked me, "Yes, man, we've understood you."
(Laughter) And then you won't forget, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say the Egocentric dad, the mom would say.
But the power took us, first, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disability, my debility.
And something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more gentlemen or worked, and then I became a volunteer in a house that hosts people with disabilities, removed from the outside and are taking the best part of me, and this is wonderful.
But...
Like in all the stories they respect.
There's always a difficult time, a boring moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability, you can fear a little, it's the biggest one of the feasures, and then the scene changes, and we went to the Padova's City Hospital, we were called me, and my wife, who is on the bridge, a doctor who makes us move in a very small stone, with a wonderful and leasiness to the neon, or is becoming a father, or she is becoming a father.
Take the paper and read trisomy 21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only thing here is that I have in my ears are the words of the little sidewalk.
Dombia Freite.
But the genius there is my wife, who says, "Yes, hug, doctor, but our son is a female," (Laughter) the doctor - maybe he didn't understand - trisomy 21 - is the Down syndrome.
It's a feminine, so I, at the point where it's a misery, we don't even know when we managed to do a mask at all, and my wife answers, "Don't worry, I've understood it great, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
(Laughter) The doctor has given us the head to the doctor's, for example.
What do I say to you?
(Applause)
(Applause) Thank you.
We searched a lot about this, but I assure you it was clearly a very difficult moment, maybe the most difficult in our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not super-herited, after a few months, it came, it's the present, which is a wonderful, beautiful and even strong!
I believe that mine is a slightly part of it, and you've understood it, and even the most beautiful thing they brought to our families, the truly wonderful thing is that all of the best people has become the best of their work, and all the people who, in some way, find each other, and if this is not the potential.
And then we made this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you know, how they're fat, because, if we talk about Down syndrome, we're all hundreds of villionists, of analyses, we know everything, but very few of these people, are all very informed from the technical point of view, but not at all, old sayings, and then, in other words, to stop the TEDx, you gather a small X.
[A.DE.]
No, why am I showing you this example?
Because you, today, to know TED, talk to people, have made a little bit of fat, here's the invitation to make a little bit of fatal and don't avoid the encounters of disability that will have in your life, both persons, but also from people around you, a very hard advertisement.
In this path, we can lose, because our attention is always the ones to give us a step forward, a grader underneath, here, in order to look into the eyes, we have to put ourselves at the same level, and in this sense, it allows me to often lose, in this sign.
In sign language, signs are the word disability, so I can't just allow you to look for paths of disability in your life, to enhance them and more importantly.
And remember that the paintings that you watched in the face are truly brave, thanks to your heart.
I thought that in order to make the revolution occurred to be a particular character, such as maoce, that I saw, or Gandhi, and then a night, in reality, in a very simple way, it changed my life, and I understood what my mission in the world, but in an internship, it captured me as many as it occurs every day, of how much it's a daily basis, thanks to a traffic, and what's what happened to me a shower thanks to a traffic.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would be my mission in the world, would be no longer dare to find out.
(Laughter) And try to make the world a little more sustainable, starting with food.
Because it's food, and not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our food decisions are usually a large part of our daily environmental impact, if we want to translate it with an indice, for our family, every single day, and perhaps, try to change a small revolution, if possible.
And it's very simple, but it's a good sense and it's optimizing, saying that almost more one word that is referred to domestic economy, probably, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the life of every day, especially to what is our memory with food.
And the use of consumers, also, is to optimize consumers, especially the way in which we compose our behavior every day, the contact, so, what are we adding to this table?
I was part of this project, so, from the meeting with the partner of the wife, of the rejects, of what we usually use outside, and here in front you have a small example at home, when we pull the vegetables, and separate from one part there is the scarce.
The scary, so the less noble part, is in average almost 50% of the raw materials, but it's not just about regaining those things of rejects, meaning having a different approach, seeing all these parts as a joint together, let's take an example with my leg, and I can see it as a group of four ingredients, for example, the chicken.
And it's also the part that comes to talk about food of the future, for example, if you don't like much, because, for example, another example of a product that should be full of sponsors, which is another very practical example, but not only because, for example, maybe, if you don't like it, you'll get too much, there's too much to be protected, so, we won't let ourselves stop because, because, therefore, let's be another example, another example, which is another example, like this, a little like this, a little like this, let's say, there's another example, let's be a bit of protecting.
But that's how simple, but I'm a very optimistic person, and they've found a Afghanistan, the French slums or ricks of prices: this in favor, a great development of professionals, are aware that they also ask to love leaders, because maybe they will find you, if not only a small change, probably, but also home, a small change of a small change, but also sometimes to the man, at home, there's no reception, but also at home, because there's a small change, because there's also a small change, because there are many of us, therefore there are many people, and therefore there, there can be anywhere there, there can be any chance, and there can be anywhere there, there, therefore there can be anywhere there, there, for men and there, therefore, there, there can be anywhere there, there, for men and therefore, there, there can be anywhere there, for men, there, there, there, therefore, there, there, there can be
(Music)
Uoooooooooooooooooooo!
No bath!
QD: I brought two data with me.
One has a common data with six faces, one that comes from one to the "Sai."
The other has gone with ten gangs: if I turn it any value from one to 10 to the same probability of dancing.
Now let's play: you'll launch the side of ten gangs, come to this game, add an equal or largest number of mine.
Five to five, among you, you came to the play.
Trying to the fact the ten earth is easier, but you must tell me approximately what is your probability of coming to this game?
I can launch the data repeatly and take the data from every victory: after 100 lights, I will realize that I will come to the seventh cave or, or, or, twice, every play, with a little bit of peace starts and lots of lights, I will see that the provedity of victory is around 75%.
(Laughter) With the random increase, my stomach based on the average of succession becomes more accurate.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed from the law of large numbers.
Later, if you had a bit nervous to launch data a thousand times, we can do a computer, your port must deliver 100 million data in a single second.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem: the revolutions in mathematical problem is called the Monte Carlo method for this capability of the computer to simulate the case, or even the installation of successful interests.
To give an answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
A pure mathematician would rhythm the method Monte Carlo, un elegant, as we would be abused of the brutal force of computer science.
To me, as a matter of magic, and for this, four years ago, I started my doctorate in the method of Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik, in Inghilterra.
S: Now let's put the data on.
I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a capital of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of methodology of Monte Carlo, which was so stretched for me, was after the first week in my doctorate, was part of an exceptional work, my performance, a supercomputer, to combine the conferences with the ordinary of the day and intelligence, competence and unanity, impatiently.
But dotted does not belong to everyone.
I spend most of my time on my own border or on a statistical article.
To confront these shadows it would be a lonely passion, that I wasn't foreseen.
That's it.
Well, here in motion seems a topic that is used for a mathematician that studies West, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than breeding, paralyzed.
But a few months after the beginning of the doctorate I started to teach, for the first 40 minutes lesson I prepared more than two weeks.
But...
With that first lesson.
If there was a hole inside me, of determination, motivation, ending, all that I needed.
And why?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't want to answer this question, I felt regenerated, I wanted to keep this euphoria state, and that's how I opened my degree, I started to live as a lesson in the lesson, and it wasn't enough to be, I wasn't based on a solitary preparation, I had to compassionate my students to make them surprised and make them enjoy more than 20 years from the birth of more advanced countries.
Preparing the equation is a creative, stimulating process, a form of art, I triggered realities in every aspect of embedding, but in a sink and even to correct the compounds.
KA: Let's dare the students, the right mistakes they are, brings a constant learning process.
And each store, each store, the lesson is my spettacol.
Around the students spent my whole life, and I was talking about them as much as they were learning about me during the third year, I also came to a specific recognition. The University of Warrick gave me the reward to the agency in gear, as a young researcher.
I was resting inside myself in a different way, and it was all so natural, beautiful, brilliant, in my small childhood, I was experiencing something that works in a long scale.
And the most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put our own passions into perspective.
At that point, I went back to everything that had happened in such a short time, until I got to the question of the first day of the lesson, you remember, why is the reason of all this euphoria, that floor, and the extent of determination?
But the answer I gave was in my way of being and in values with which I grew up, the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects, benches without astrology, that have disappeared between more people, instead of reserving them to almost scorbator.
Is there a concert?
Behind TED, this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence, a passion, a talent, the happiness.
Among these benefits, there is also knowledge.
I had found value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge, and my mind had already moved itself when I wanted to put in motion the lies of my students.
And I've told you this captain of my story, precisely because I think that what I learned was shared, he told me to take it aside, as you have understood the passion of education is great, now I'm writing my doctorate thesis, or to end up in the next few months, and it's a moment to decide my next step, but we'll be able to see, but we'll be able to see, but we'll be able to see, but we'll be able to see, but we'll be able to see.
But there's the last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
But he invited me to teach.
It's a combination of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in the classroom.
(Laughter) I enter a good eye, I say the cathedra and the microphone was OK, my three colorful penels were cold.
In his face of the time, I cut myself off the voice, there's already silence.
I hope that the exercise is also prepared, it will allow us to pass through all the key points of the course.
I didn't see the lady, but I spent the Saturday night to meet the friends of the five years passed, I picked up everything they can expect in a scheman, they could have a final lesson, it's true, we've had a few time for practice, but there's a lot of material online, and where to find the written on the right of the diagram.
I'm satisfied, well, let's start with the show: someone asks a very difficult question, I scratch to the washing machine, but often an animation to ask them how to procedure, but I had the dinner of their gender book, I was well prepared, I had the cage.
I work with them to make them take the breath, a group of students breath, someone asks for clearings, but most of them are reassuring.
A final student approaches me.
The solved, he, sitting in talking, seems strange, is looking for the words just.
And finally, the courage is only to tell me.
[A.DE.]
But I just want to thank you.
Because what you do for us doesn't do it.
I'm only in the classroom, and I have a huge smile and a bigger heart, and I think that maybe it's exactly the same to my place in this world.
Well, this is what I want to tell you.
Feel and heart are connected widely, and that's why, when your mind is in motion, your heart also beats strong inside the pet, your mind is in movement, thank you.
Always, theicia!

Always, theicia!
Perfect!
Hello everyone, today I want to share with you how a bird vocal has changed my perspective on leadership.
It was built in the US and it was doing mass reforms.
What is interesting about the change is that, as we've already told you before, we've introduced it in a very clear way - now, we all approached the change, the first thing you've had is, beyond fear.
And the opportunity seems that right now, instead of diversity, you feel far from the collective, feel that in this change there are many people brought together, stamping there are so many people with a different intelligence, each one of them has more intelligences, and says, "Papá, but why are they connected to them?"
So this diversity, in fact, is exactly thechia who likes to do something different.
I try to build, to modify, to find a meaning response, and that's the difficulty a little, but, if you want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, I need to create leaders of change, that I've been working for many years in companies, today, I'm taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
Then, when I drink this birds, at some point I start writing, I'm always in the United States, writing in a paper, the word change, adds this word change, I start with a thinking that gives me in these words and forms a hateful act.
Because in reality it's a presa, it's a little of the achievement that, for me, is clearly the prosthesis of personal whole, and, in fact, what happens to us is exactly in the dimension of not only change, we are often called to manage change, meaning in Germany, it's also about having to do something else.
Then, the prosthesis, the change of prosthesis, the project, bring people from one part to another, and all that I do because of the development of creative thinking, which is a bit of leading them to transforming this transformation.
Because in doing this, if it's true that the work of me, on the other hand, but I also have the permission to be afraid, but I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model is creative in its own way.
And finally, we don't talk about creativity as something linked to talented people, to genders, exclusively to artists or to someone who may maybe take care of works, rather than communication, but creativity is something everybody's thing, has transformed the environment in which you are.
And if this is true, it's also true that you can learn, you can encourage your creativity, simple, simple, here we have started with a tunnel, brainstorming, it's one of you that allows you to fulfill your creativity.
(Laughter) To make a slightly deliberate movement, so to start to lead to the absence of seriousness to your emotions, those forces that make you feel fear, that when you feel that it's not courageous, and to take the leap, and don't do it, it's also those forces to support the judgment.
And to launch ourselves in a generation of opportunity.
And what's interesting is that by doing this, it's not that you stay diferent to the contesto, and that to say what transformations are about, how to say, inside, but there's no so much for the idea of managing, but also to nourish opportunities, we'll say in management, create the climate, but in a particular impact on the inside the organic processes, what do you mean?
But also dare to leader the opportunity to build a climate with your actions, that to nourish is that every day you build the conting, maybe it's not the most beautiful, even if I don't say it, better I'm in silence, I start all this internal dialogue, then I don't know why we grow with a free spiral, but they can also get to get rid of it, and to do what, and to make us exploit the creative spirit.
And here, in addition, the impact you have when you do this, when you conceive to dream, has an impact then that necessarily reminds you of whether it doesn't seem to be an organization, but also to reinvent the very client's relationship because the prosthesis is completely changed, then to get back to the original cave.
Well, the idea is precisely.
We can make a paradigm, change our paradigm, meaning what, so the sense of attention we've seen before in the video, but this press clearly seems to be aware of the situation of being conscious, of bringing the spirit to say, in which way today I can be curious, or observing people, I can find something that is not so ignored, thank you.
We're about to reach the most powerful, the most diffusing invention of man, the city, and it's also the only time that I'm sure you're able to think: together with these places to be together, to be together, how many times you've been able, for thousands of years in what we call cities.
And there will also be an important question for the forehead, but it's clearly the process of the city, and, as you can see, maybe not too much, and in fact, in this city, the largest process of history began, with the most uneaspectful sentence, what I call Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
(Laughter) They lived in Manchester and didn't see what today captivates you when spend your weekend in New York or in Parigi, imagine, poverty everywhere.
And of course, both scratches with the book, over the years, we've been from 1850, in the beginning of Novecent, there were also the disciplines of the tools to limit this phenomenon, which was probably something necessary sometimes, but to contain, and from this you can see here behind.
Let's also imagine the movies, that you may have heard about, with bizzy tools, one is called Lizon's regoling, that the roof that when you have to change a mucus at home, you have to do hundreds of practices, is a total resolution sentence.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, it discovered that the city is not the cause of all sorts in the world, but despite the growth of the population.
This is the solution, elementary elements that motivate this ability, which is the city to improve the world, the first one is density, security, and economical development, the ability to create knowledge to all the greatest questions that affect the human gender.
Then, maybe in this moment, after a million years of history, we've imagined this spontaneously: the greatness,chanisms of means of containment of the human phenomenon, and courage, that, if you consider that the city makes a trip together in a bus, the people - we're all involved to confront this city for the great support - and so the city saves the world, that, in this moment, instead, in this moment, it's no longer easy to eat the city, the city, there's more, there are more, there are more people, there are more people, there are more people, there, there are more people, there, there are more people, there, there are more people, there, there are more people, there, there, there are more people, there, there, there are more people, there, there, there, there are more people, there, there, there, there, there, there are many people, there, there, there, there, there, there, there are many people, there.
And this is an image from the top of the city, which together is to fight with courage, because it grows in the city, walking, for example, to see the maps of the city as the urban setting, the world's biggest, 72 km wide, with this map turned to the city, that can imagine, first, the absence of solution of the cities like the local.
There's still one.
(Laughter) "Tell me down, cement."
I don't know if you all have this historic mind, and the second example is instead of a city.
A few billion miles from here, I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires, Argentina, the capital, and it's been put in quesit, a few years ago, what to do with this city in 2030 with all of the adventures, the place where everyone has a chance.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city that I've proposed, has been in some way uncertained.
Violence, poverty also derived from a more enthusiastic national crisis, and the temptation of what was the solite?
(Laughter) It's about...
By comparing the bass with the same ability to believe the unitaging of development, and also with courage to the strength of this mental weapon, what are the cities?
As in the vital stage, in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies: three strategies.
And then building more people in the city, any more basis on stronger neighborhoods, that accelerate development, calling the population not only of agency, but increasing a million people in more in the city, which means a huge infrastructure magician.
I also suffer that allows us to increasingly believe in this development and accelerate it, and then, as I mentioned, social spaces.
What spaces?
A green and pedonal diaper.
And these three stratags together were working on the development of Buenos Aires, knowing that cities are the solution to all around the world.
It's still once again.
And maybe choosing the location on the end, you will see it from thealto: this great invention of humanity, which is the city.
You're feeling different in your heart and you're going to answer that question that you've asked yourself so many times, and maybe you're proud of living in what I call the city sector, thank you.
(Laughter) The words are important.
They put us in a relationship, in a way to our mind: the words of our language are extraordinary, they are on an opportunity that they are full of emotional stories, they are on note.
They are evocative, they laugh with our history and beauty of our language.
And it's the fact that this beauty is tattered, preserved, perceptible.
Once again, I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to talk about it.
In the English, the provincial entrance and motivated many times obscure of English Italian words, which for a few years has started to become common, but will take it a little further and I will start to show you some Latin words.
There are many mouths on their insign and the world's greatest universities, and they show them with great budget: here we are in Australia, here we are in a congh, and there is a Latin motto, in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia, in Svezia, in the UK, in Oxford.
In Chicago, the United States not only did they say in Latin, Parigi has a Latin motto, Canada, Kindland in Australia, there's a Latin motto, and with Latin mothers, because if there's a single place in the world, where a Latin motto could be in, the American marine always says in many years, if the British marine always spoke about millennium, if the British marine, if you've always heard it, it's never been seen before, it's not been seen before, like NASA, like this passatist, like NASA, and NASA.
Exclusion: the "atural" of "attivo."
"Yeah!"
Instead, what is the recent marriage, touristical city of Rome, has proven the launch of the Human municipality, and that?
(Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we should say, "Room, me and you, Wow, Mendyu," what is this subsidiary of bass waves, what is this contamination, this quote of circuit between two lines that gives sense to each one, what are the five stalks high?
And one is asked.
Napel?
But because when we look at all the tourist patients in all the cities of the world, there is no one who leaves the point to settle their name for you to move, from anywhere, only to Rome.
"Daddy, dad, you have your penetration."
Let's consider a total twistic attack.
(Applause) A round of applause from the Benicuto Ministry, see it beautiful, OK?
(Laughter) No, it's not really beautiful to see, Beautiful: we collision English Italians in an insensite way, it doesn't even like an anglophone, the curious thing is this.
G.G.
Two Italian speaker: we're still Italian, I mean, I'm talking about it.
The most romantic language in the world, opposed to "Roomyangyu," stubbed by Org, the most dominant language in the world, according to linguistic precedents, in the association.
The fourth most studied language in the world and don't study the Italian to do businesses: studio or because they love it for the swimming pool, for opening, for art, for history, for Dante, they study it for this.
We're talking.
We're talking about angels, like Thomas Mall.
And he said, "Pudder."
Let's see, for example.
But the pizza has conquered the world continuing to call us pizza.
Here you can see the pizzery map in the United States, facing the negotiation map, selling hamburgers or Otdoxon, comes the pizza.
So, if the whole world eats and says, "Pizza, why do we here in Italy have wine?"
(Laughter) That's it.
We change food, and we drink wai in Luca, meaning nobbio, Catania, Military.
And the thing is curious because it's in New York.
So, there's a story to promote, in the weekend of Italian wine, of Colombian wine.
Why the distant ones from New York?
Happy and plantations that sell food and wine.
And they say,
Wow!
Let's talk about another Italian eccellence: let's drop food and listen to fashion.
That's it?
It's what works in the fashion magazines, Italian fashion shows: the "free colors," the "blem," directly from the passes of the "fowinter," and OK, we've understood that the talks are no longer the ones once.
(Laughter) You can stand up for a moment.
Don't think about it as if it were a mountain road in the Gran Canyon, not crazy.
Well, as they're made of our Devenery.
And the women we see in our mental birthrates, why do you run?
But you can see, there are no strings: this is the publicity spread via a vecture of us in Spain and in Spain, Spanish: this is a publicity of medals for the possums and French talks, this is the same payment in English Italy, there are two, only Italian words: the first one.
What's happening to us if the union perfectly?
(Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies, let's call us, theinians, this: UNYOS.
Riuniosi.
(Laughter) She always says it catitalian, isn't it?
(Laughter) We're segmented, here, the curious thing, because over two suchings, an Italian in two doesn't speak an English word.
60% of 2012 we say, so we don't know English, we don't know how a country, and we can see it.
And here we have to wait that the medical abilities of the sign who has compiled with the sign, who has compiled this aspect of the islands, are much better, linguistic competitions.
However, every day, for drugs and prediction, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are self-vincial, we use a number of English words that don't need.
(Laughter) Not deeply, it's said in the text of the Italian language, she has purely access and subtle.
We put together, instead of calling, let's say the occasions, instead of place, I've heard to say, "The clockery is the "lockering" that was chosen by the thirst of a patent is a "location."
CR: We tell the tales of compilation, we say "fasting" of "why ideas."
(Laughter) In the ufficies we can feel, we must split a set of toothpaste lines joining the face against the insatisfaction.
(Laughter) It's a joint with business.
(Laughter) When I'd just say we should call "Pippo Franco and Gennado" to put this application on the official service, because the unit is always like, straight and newspaper.
(Laughter) The Internet and the e-mail talk not only about it in companies, but also in average, public recording, the government, in English, that won't be more sympathetic, because it has an English name.
That's it.
I thought, with the kids of my work, and a little bit of energy: this application that invites public recordings, the government, the companies, in average, to say it, in Italian, and the remains, in first occasion, at the Cusca Academy, because you did it, it became totally protagonist of this problem, and not what is a little bit of success, in feet, in feet, in the foot, in a initiative, in the network for 70,000 people.
They have signed young people, elderly, globey poles and people who don't spike that the engineer has signed up professional suppliers and have called pensioners, they signed Italian people in the west saying, "What does our language do?"
To look at these signs that grew up, we could read the motivations.
And I want to make you see someone: Italian is a right, but also a doer, we are in novel of fuel, if we think abundantly, we pay other tangoscodetically, we pay to work in a public administration public, to movies, because I've studied Classic University, but I'm working with economists, working in fashion, I've received a LISPR printer, and I don't think we've done it.
(Laughter) A good Italian and an English speaker is better than a speaker and English, Sisher.
(Laughter) And we know what we're wearing AND.
This is one of the most.
Sterepitesa: I have a new slam, but italian Parlian says, "Cchung, go Rome's food."
So I started to let me talk about our language decence, because I'd never like to say you are diagnosed and funnels that split from occasions.
For Dante, in Montal, in Caproni, in Paese, Bebiangard, Bergata, I'm stubborn to feel relatives who don't know how to say Table's bugs, but they fill up the Company bow, but you do, and so on, and so on, we sign because I don't believe that those who say "CUL is cool."
But the movie, because I've heard of it, the universities that say displegated, instead, that they visualize.
I'm filming because I don't know the insult.
I think because I want to understand what politicians say that they ask my vote.
And for now that somebody will finally take these initiatives, I'm 85 years old, thanks for engines.
Well, as we said, an extraordinary ecosystem transversing because in mass communication, they established this thing of cost $0 on the Internet and its widely amplified.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on Italian newspapers, with a transversal consensus and imaginable: Wired spoke and spoke about Vanice Ferro - he spoke about Famiglia Cristiana - he spoke about the Turing's menzine, he didn't even talk about the Touring Mensile.
Why?
And that all the usual archae is gained, also a little here and somewhere, and that are deeply committed to more thanchia and hanging up to the most populations.
And I'm often a great wish of encouraging Russia with the Portuguese and consciousness of our language: these things are ending in interactions, I also touched myself in the city, and on the beach of the Eastics, it was painted by the radio, I was interviewed by an Australian radio, from a lion, here there's a need for this.
And all of this?
It's something that is born from consciousness of each of us, because language is what we tend to each moment of our talk, of our thinking and of our writing every day.
So the hell is ...
And we have all streams, the Italian.
And I remember, in conclusions, some reason to do it: Italian operation helps us understand everyone, we don't want norms, we don't want to wear, we want to give examples, and we need to ask the institutions to give the good example: our language is done by promotion, we need to sell the door in the world.
So in English, besides, and we saw it and easy to straighten, so those who talk better about the way it works, and then he was called Leonardo, in the first of the talks of this journal, the resonator who defined himself "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he'd scratch the volcano, in Italian, always the structure, the way of decency, helps us express our creativity, if we resign to express our language, we resign to express one of our pecuriarities.
Even if our linguistic thesis is strengthened and used to be able to pick up some terms of strange.
So, we need to enhance it inside a couch that is not fulfilling and it's loosed by losing sense of what is necessary to an excess, of terminals, or of evil, why am I saying this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identities, our radicies, our history, our openness to the world, that passes from our words, thank you.
What does it mean to be a young Karghiver?
And when does a guy look bad?
Treatment is all about that person, about its needs.
And he says, "But if that person, even to something that doesn't happen, is your mom, or your grandma?"
And what happens to you, if mom or dad or her parents started to feel bad if a child or a teenager still had the worst idea of being a young age, as everyone went to school, I asked for help and dressed with friends, but what's behind these photos that you don't see?
If I ask you what has changed, what is vital, always from the beginning: I'd like to take a step back, to regain a part of the lady and tell you that I still love the channels, and I've changed my hair, but what is it that is invisible in those photos, what has brought me from my mother, that you can see the lyrics?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until then bring it back.
A tsunami is called "S health problem," and when a parent hits, and you're still a child, the teenager, they're your reference points, they become really complicated.
What if I told you that the health problem ...
[A.DE.]
Is it a mental health problem?
A child's affection can be very heavy, and it can be made of sensations of harm, fear, fear, rage, sadness, love, and hate that they end up again: the constant feeling of walking on the waves, an excessive burden of responsibility.
The difficulty to concentrate, or to be a victim of bullism, perhaps because of the bizzious behaviors that your child could have.
But in addition to this, we'll have to do with the alterns of being in a depressive way, without anybody preparing to do it, or even wishing, setting up at the suicide attacks.
But in addition to all this, I also had to keep doing the whole life, go to school, study, why I'm here today and adding another character, which is often not able to talk to anyone.
If you say that your mother or your OK, a physical health problem, a tumour, another physical pathology, hardly someone will consider you, as a genetically committed and destined to automatically, or if there's no diagnosis to describe the same disorder, but if they do something that doesn't answer the eternal world will be completely different.
Nowadays, in all the world, physical health, mental health doesn't give the same dignity and respect, and for you that, if your children, affection becomes even more heavy.
The weather that we perceived around you the difficulty of communicating inside you and family members, stigma, prejudice, feature, can bring the situation, at the same time there was even a result of help that couldn't help us out that no one, neither at school, imagined.
When the first grade started to open, in that horn, when, for the first time, light started to filter, I remember again the psychologist of the family consulte, the first person affected was my family, the one I had the chance to open myself, and that helped me, obviously, to individuate the crazy lines that had brought me to the travelers.
But the stories of our children with mental disorders are all different, all united, but there's one thing that has impacted me and that we have in common, and that we're often convinced of being the unites.
And you know why it happens that from our children's stories there is no one who has lived the same things we've lived on us, but it's statistically impossible, in the world we're millions of people, and yet we've been inviting us to prove that there's no other that we've experienced the same things we've lived with us.
Through children's stories, activists, from Australia, the United States and Canada, I couldn't only give a name to emotions that I've experienced and understood that natural reactions to what I've experienced, but could also see the positive characteristics that were born precisely to face this situation.
So I imprisoned my first intercontinent path, on my own, and I traveled to Vancouver in Canada, to meet these children, because their view, the story I had experienced, but also the story of writing: this encounter was an owner, an immense owner, which gave me energy even now, their view, the pain, but also the capacity to transform that pain into seeds for a powerful change in all of them, because they didn't recognize me, but they see the characteristics of resilience, resiliants, resiliants, in Italy, in order to transform the change, in order to change.
And that's how we arrive today, in 2017, with other Italian children, Gaia Carlo and Marco, we started to born the first Italian association that created children for other children, to give voice to children guided to all the doctor and sedentary centers of Italy, because no kid is left alone, but also to cure for their mental disorder, and also for a period of time.
But initially, when I thought about this project, another desire we have is the point of observing, and the other enormous desire we're realizing is to find the schools, to talk with the students, with the youngsters, not only the threads we have, but all of them, to find that, alone in the civil society, that perhaps they haven't experienced this experience, that they wanted to become our positions in the change, and to bring a coppy in two, to save the quickly.
It's a long and tortuous path that we have in front of us.
There's one thing I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that parents with mental disorder we have, is the will to change their scope, and that's why I know that these kids will make their desire happen, and also thanks to you, we learn together the door that was not open for us, let's get the light, thank you.
But today I want to talk to you about a specific person: Aaron Sfarz.
This is how, when they have dedicated a documentary last year, in 2014, the year initolated by the Internet on-boy, the Internet pupil.
It's very difficult to put an asset in specific category, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, and it's easier but it's a list for the technical of projects he collaborated with for about ten decades, and an intellectual until ten years ago.
And constructed in 15 years the Creative Commons, who were responsible for the technical part: today the Creative Commons are around a part of content, they are free licenses, they believe the most flexible and open copyright, for example, are the Wikipedia's license.
After 20 years, a small start-up started to build something that is called a network, becomes a millionaire, from one day to another, they proved, honestly, they didn't get much money from the fame, they still do what they've always done to build an open and collaborative library Internet, because it would limit enormously the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Chinareo absolutely collapse is an extraordinary, fantastic, marvelous, curious thing: Aaronne told him himself in his blog and he was able to read until 150 years ago, all the tasks of computer education revolved with the capital of March under the arm at 16 years.
Aaron told her brother in a very touched moment of the documentary that had absolutely had to see, and he had learned how to learn prestibly: she told her mother that, at some point, she was kicking her, and a Aaron was two and a half years old, was killed in the segelon, and he had the avenue on the fridge she had just attacked with the penis accent.
But here comes an important thing: this seven knowledge has a mirror, to its grade, the knowledge, the knowledge itself, and the knowledge of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at Aaron's projects, we can see that there are all tools and technologies to access information, HIV's Internet preserve memory, at RSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, that allows blogs to synchronize, creativity, so they make access to people of content, creative content.
Power information, which we just need to think a second, we're everywhere: we're in schools, libraries, universities, which means giving access to information to people is to say, making a democratic act, our disabled literally basically bass on giving access to learning, education, without this there is no democracia.
It's an act of empowerment, of abilities of others.
Aaron came to this genius which he is, this came from his cultural background, which is the one of theker, the Aker, not as a hut, not as a hut.
And when you know the code and you have the abilities to read it, you can change it, you can do it yourself, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary sentence to change the world, to make it unreachable, to modify it.
Finding the world a better presumppone place, made by people, so fundamentally they're culture, so fundamentally they're made of words: everything becomes accountable at the moment when you know the code and know how it changes.
But you don't do this with it: if you make the world think, with open access, everybody can add it, make the world a little better, you don't become a monopolic act, but you become a building act.
Around aproximadamente, in 2011 Aaronne was interested in this thing called Open HACS, a great movement for free access to scientific literature, the world which is absolutely chaotic and controversial, contradictory.
And Aaron is passionate about this, scratch this thing called Open Hands, Guerrilla Open Hits Manifesto, scratches it between the other here in Italy, the first steps was power information.
There are dozens of thousands of artists, hundreds of thousands of artists from an academic database, manager, and it was bidden, AFBI was interested in it, not a hacker of this genius probably hadn't been observed.
It means that your opportunity to give Aaron an example: you want to give a small example to show all hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a set of rules.
Then came the aromine made of a veracity and its technical persecution to scarce hundreds of hundreds of thousands of artists from walked to the academic fish and could do it, but not in that scenario, they were answered at 35 years, two years later her first armon is involved at home, in New York, was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, which is power information.
And if I decided to be the engineering who holds the system, well, these will leave you with all the strength combined with the ingrangements around you, I would like to show you now a minute through the last intervention of arnospharies, a few months before dying.
I think it's a bit like that ... (Video) (English) I'm a very happy person who loves me.
But also now all the describes.
S: You know that you talk about a teacher, (Laughter) I'm a person who has seen me as a teacher.
And what about it?
It has seen a little in prospective: requisition of Craig, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Biting and Bitcoin in Bitcoin, Bitcoin in Bitcoin.
Rondice is something banal and fundamental.
One important thing is Knowledge, depends on us, what will come from, the hell we live in every day, and in reality these things are equal, there are things that coexist in the same way, the Internet is too complex, the form of mass spioning is used to check, to check, to oppress, and first or foremost, and living beings aren't something you want.
Two things are there to not suffer: the first step is easy to many, accept hell and become part, until the point of not seeing it anymore; second risky demands attention and learning continues, and to make it last and give you space.
G.G: Thank you.
Good afternoon everyone, then in 1950.
I was eating with some physical colleagues in the area of the lab of Losalamos and improvedly I had a look at theattoo and asked where all of them are.
And then, if life had appeared, it was overwhelmed, no, I had hacked a reason that on Earth could be in the intelligent galaxy, incredibly larger than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, compared to us, we've never been told by any of these intelligent potentials, and since there's no one out there.
And I believe that this is a question that we are all made in the bright, we can do better, but also in the right future, we can do better, but also the light that, of course, there are - in a sea of green space - and therefore, in a sea, in a sea of spacial spaces, sometimes, in an example, in an overwhelming part, that we can make us a repair of planets of pianets, that we are always, that there are many, to understand that there are not always, for example, in a center of the planet, there are no longer there, there are always a time, there is no longer, there, there is no more time, there, there is no longer, there, there, there is no more time for us, there, there, there is no longer, there, there, there is no more time, there,
The dinosaurs appear all the history of humanity, it's on the tip of unghia, and in the beginning of the last false, an natural catastrophic event, very likely to the impact of a large asteroid, the atmosphere of the Earth, along with three quarters of living species, at the moment of the planet, and so it shouldn't bring our human species that no longer exist, like neanderthal.
And then, in all this space, I think that even more we have the obligation of keeping access, so we have this fantasy, simple batteries, the pregnancy can be dominated, maybe one day, as I wish, discover that there is also a bit the only expectancy to be part of the Cosmo, that there is there of diving, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that, of that there is also a little, of that there is also a bit of the unique expectancy of making a part of the Cosmo, of that there is a Cosmo, of that there is there, of that there, of God, of, of that, of, of that, of that, of a, of, of a, of a, of a, of, of a, of, of a, of a, of, of a, of a, of a, of, of, of a, of a, of a, of, of, of a, of a, of a, of a, of a, of a, of, of a, of a, of a, of
The story that I want to talk about today is a story of sport, but not from the fact of victory sport, not from the fact that someone has come first, classified, but from the fact that it generates positivity and positive things for others: one sport, then sing, believe in you, it gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running yes, because I enjoy running, and here is me, after these 116 km, with all the participants who instead of running, instead of being concerned about getting to the first or coming in the last few, we came together after these 116 Chilean agoners.
The journey is the difficulties already started during the first days: we're terrified in Windock, which is high inside the map, and after six hours of travel, it's enough.
But the difficulties we arrived in the MIB desert, the oldest desert in the world.
The beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics I chose for this kind of garage.
And here is another chance, the pettoral, the petitoral that has shown me, the number know yet: I know this is an important number for me.
This is the first cover in the garbage, the first cover is a night cover, a cover of 15 Chileans, so it's very simple, so there are Chileans all of us, right?
Then we go there during our attitudes, but the desert is general, the choir is a bit like the metaphor of life, no, you start doing things.
Later, during life, imprevists happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a woman, if it's time to do something beautiful, you have to go forward and know how to react, there's always the chance to react, and I had the first difficulty to have after three kilometers.
Good afternoon everyone, thank you all!
(Laughter) Sured, we did it... (Laughter) And, of course, things that map it, it's done, okay.
Good afternoon everyone.
Actually, I couldn't bother, because in this jungle, it was associated with an important initiative of Found Risinga, an important initiative to pick up basic sources of the loop in the fight against the two Chileans that is lasted, because it's the exact level of unidity, which we have, but I'm always spliting a degree, in a infant tumour, but in a infant tumour, which is very often to give a pupa, because we had to move forward to these children.
And we also feel during all our journeys, during all our workplaces, inhabitable places, we feel inhabitable, we feel.
All the kids to be happy must have the cellulare, not the last fashion, and when they run 15 or 20 kilometers around you there was nothing powerful, but unfortunately, in the desert you realize that you are a point, maybe where you are around you, and I run around 15, 20 kilometers where there was nothing, they were going to eat, they stopped.
Knowing from Pumino there is birth to this desert, it was about to grab a hook warning, or nearly, corsa, you can see it here on the tip of the slums, which then split from the other side, and as if it touches the sky, because inside there is no only for salary, now we don't have to be happy, not only for the window, but also for the City Center, there were only 6 km/h, but also at 1/100 km/100 that also corresponds to the coast of the world here, here.
(Laughter) Sorry, at the same time, four kilometers percept of two: (Whispering) "No sea, it's full and happy."
[Inglese] Thanks to all that I've been giving strength, [Inglese] Tchau hits me, brown, come, I've become a dog!
I, in the desert, I found, even when I was also invited this morning, when I talked about the small principle and my well-being, and I found so many people with me who shared it, other than 26 people, because it was a garage with a lot of contents, 1996, it was 96 and the enthusiasm of people who crossed with me, in the end, the last 20 nuclear 200ometers could make a magic, a magic, an incredible magic.
(Laughter) They were all very humble, I lasted partners, because the horses were a bit rigid.
So these are us, because the organization that had made a Chile far away from the front had given the gang to give me the chance to come and finish the uffician cabin, then go back, take the other Chile, and then go back toward, to reach 16, important and recurrent.
The amount of basic income was finished and achieved its goal: December 20th, 2016, that if you take the figures, it's exactly the numbers that make 116 km, or 116 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that: I wasn't like that, so it's not that there's hope for all, don't worry, you can also run out of you, I was just that, maybe a bit more, I had 40, more friends.
I wasn't really sports, I smoke when I had other caps to think about it, and I was surely 100 meters away, right?
I wasn't alone.
Isn't it?
Use them.
Look, ahhh!
[A.DE.]
It's a bit like the race, what I mentioned before, at the end of the fat, sometimes you should know how to add: this is the first day of school, and this celebrated hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malformation that we didn't know, in the first elementary, so big during birth, and at the end of the school, during two kids, and this is the first day of school, a little bigger, Riccardo, who, 17 years ago, was the other Pietro who already said.
(Laughter)
Clearly, when it seemed like everything was going well, February 18th no ...
I don't want to give you a brutal impression.
But in these moments...
But you don't have to let it go.
But it needs it.
But do you have to continue?
(Applause) Keep on trying to give you the strength to those who are teasing, because remember that problems are always the ones who are left behind.
And give the chance to the other two that arrived: it arrived to Emma, and it's never arrived on the 29th of July to San Pietro.
The message that I'm telling you today is an important message: whatever big or small is always the meal, but above all from the physical point of view, to give people the strength, and to be me, and I'll continue to not run by myself, but the objective is always the meal, and here there are many combinations of so many, and to move forward.
Because life is a bit like a bottle, right?
And today we are here, and today it's 17/6 of 2017.
And three times I know, you see how you want to interpret it, thanks to all of you.
