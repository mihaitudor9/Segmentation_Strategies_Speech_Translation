(Applause)
Have you ever thought about how people's residence is?
If there's any difference?
My role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, people with and without disability, today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to play clothes?
Does someone's help or be here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about this.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took it to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made the fall of the piece lose.
And, outside, they lost a lot of time and lost money, and many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this job, the conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I did it, a pants with high-pitched coast, made a super discreet zip to be able to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of this piece.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no retreat to not form expensive, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button, to facilitate the time to go through our heads.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegic, ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person and for paraplegics, who give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with and without disability.
And for courtyard, I made a rehearsal.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, under the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that would use in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
And for women, journalism or low status, the ideal is to think about adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal role, children's names.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and that means.
More than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels, ready and stamped.
more likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world, which is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
And I took the second place.
What about me?
Silvana ...
The "drika."
And many other people ...
Several other stylists ...
Small brands are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who were already launching inclusive collections, due to the size of the success that was the first, and the target was also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
For all of us to think about this, we must have empathy.
Look at others.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
[A.DE.]
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause) My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
I was designing people as a four-year-old child, until adolescence, and I was going through an adult.
Putting your teeth, knowing how to separate the other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and I won parents' awareness.
The parents were delivering me to the children.
People recognize me in the community?
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate.
But today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community ... (Laughter)
We have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
I'm going to work with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
There, I met a plant called her name of Engar, it's a luminous plant.
And we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers fast and soil.
And all the quantum plants.
And in our community, below it, we have a good result.
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met ...
That all plants ...
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth, right?
So, you have to imitate the forest, because there in the arm.
I had a lot of prag that was giving more plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
That's it.
So I tried to plant them, various, there I have the "CUpo," "Graviola," "Andyroba," "Copaiba," with Maru, Guaraná.
And everything doesn't give up, (Laughter) "Light, eat?"
There, everything is natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxin.
A blanket.
And besides, without comparison to ours, in our communities, we work there, everything with organism.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxon in our communities, you know?
"Me?"
To compare the human being as an animal.
The child compared it and said, "You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children."
The Pope Gai came to this tension, then he talks to the animal quote, so I compare the child like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection, the greatest care for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything into the eye, "My father says this, the first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us."
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person who observed my house.
I was observing my house and ... (Laughter)
I saw that my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad." (Laughter)
So, I saw that all of this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's OK.
And today, we have ...
A work inside costs the gift of the human being.
"The skyloning of the other hand?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand children, for those who don't know what's far from the human being, it's the Amazon tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river that, before, had a dam.
In front of us, it's like this a little bit of our community.
And ...
This hooligan cried and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're getting there.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
I went through this person.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
We breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ... (Laughter)
Is it always talking to people educating children?
And ...
I'm going through other people, and I have the message to leave a very small phrase that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come to us and come to us.
Are we talking and competing people?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Hi, guys, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) Thank you very much (Applause) Thank you very much.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the largest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most siblings you're here, as we feel, as a fear of losing your child.
(Laughter) And we caught two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find it.
They did all a very big movement, divulging the press, social networks, everywhere, taking people from the blood, medulating, very incredible, it was a very nice movement for him to make a transplant of metro, what he needs to be cured.
It brought us a very important message for all of us, first for us, and then for the rest of the world.
It was that when a child has leukemia and tries of life, all the rest of the problems of fears, of concerns don't matter.
Moreover, there's no relevance, it really matters, and we learned to be established, and it spreads for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
What matters more or more important to life, to fight for life, and for love, the second message he spent with this public and all that movement of finding a donor?
It was that people saw us as a family, homosexual, parental man.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or an important father of a mother to have a family, or a father of a mother, this is the union, this is what gives life, this is what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that transcribe happened to us with this disease, to the world: "What?"
My blood, my medulated anxiety, we were able to manufacture them: our manufacture.
The blood is born pain, it's a human being to donate blood for those who need it, so it's also upset, it raised this consciousness, we have this ability to donate blood.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating "medula ossea" is challenging as a "medula ossia module, the chances of compatibility.
So if you, between a donor and a patient, I, when I get married, "Oh, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in my life, you can be the most beautiful one, and the message that can save in life without me, but strength, without encouraging, I'm giving a part of me.
Or supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that awareness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you (Applause) (Cheers)
(Music) (Music)
She slept in Alaikon.
Basically, that's it.
(End of video) The base is like you.
This is deafness.
Two slams.
My name is Talola del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I studied in Damasco's university, today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a bit...
(Laughter) That's why, in French, Portuguese.
I'm sorry, without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brochancetto," who exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that don't have anything to do as Slam.
A war chest.
The beer was beautiful, cheap, and easy to live, the population was 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child.
Two apartments, and I loved to know the world, a sculptor of engineering, I went to countries like the United States, Spain, France.
Until one day the war started, on March 15th, 2011, and then all the other cities of the country arrived.
My mask city was the saferest in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
After five years of war, the country is destroyed.
People, who know me, were forced to carry, or each of their children.
My last years found their vacuum wives and mutilated by a bomb, family members, and they didn't come back in the series, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have been killed or have been refugee in other countries.
In my family, we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because our relatives and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to go back to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
It's about that Brazil had opened the doors for Syrian, so I went to Barbai Ruti, after ten months, to protect my family, and wish São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why did they have more opportunities?
And you saw Pinas, or a week, to knock back.
Forty years of my life.
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, from the community that my wife did, talked very well, and everyone talked very well, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and I was a party to celebrate the university of my children.
(Laughter)
And making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook Bachina on Facebook, "Hey, Syria, that's why now everything has a channel and paper, (Applause) I'm in the food of Syria.
I do food and deliver to Tibor WhatsApp (Laughter) (Laughter)
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
I think the slam likes blood, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says to me, "I, after it happened in France, with a human person, now, and I don't want to talk or talk.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the so-called "Today men," or Alkuron, not only sacred book, which kills a person, without it being allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly the opposite state.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunitar, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there is no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like the differences of religion culture.
When you use your wine, a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covers the hair, like my wife, and my wife ask questions like, "Why do you use excellence?"
In Jabi's land, there are other rules.
Men and women can't touch me, embrace, embrace me, except the voice of wedding, some people tell me, but I've already seen the humans who do all this.
They see only those rules, but each person wants to buy, or not, they also blame some things, the same way they have grown up, that they don't obey everything, they don't move well, they haven't allowed to eat dead channels in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Or it was sex as more than a single man.
This never happened to me, (Laughter) Why do these things come out of the slam?
Our religion is very important for us.
But the teacher Mohamadez Profete, who should respect all religions, that all people have the same value.
That we have to have truth with everyone.
It doesn't matter if we take two, five percent of all our money to the poorest people, it doesn't matter if poor are human, crossed today, and I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows the best Islam to end with or whiskers, my children.
And your children?
Boubuder grows together based on the cell phone.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, my rhythms come to recite in the Sun in Santos, I'm prepared to take a bathroom, always ready to not give up the love of those who always wait for cancer.
Those who always believe in it, don't believe me, soon because of hope, but in the daily lap, I know who suffers, the label makes food, my salary ends, just like this race, studies the girl, what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I had a lot, a cook ...
"Fashineira, why not hire me in the mall?" I don't understand if it was for the option of all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity and the mouth told me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn the left, enter that little corner that the vastor is overwhelming, be welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, the page I created in Facebook, like the newspaper, I still didn't have anything programmed, so I took a few memories from when I was a maid and saw everything I achieved in my life, so that, in this case, other people were already going to talk about the Facebook's success, and I decided to compat the rest and I kept following that everyone was always talking about it in the past.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use the glass in her house and not the bathroom, and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I did.
In her house?
There was the bathroom for domestics, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the website because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last stories and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I gave interviews to various media, both international media, national media, London, TV show and Germany.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces, that from the employment announces that I titled "When I started talking about the most valued domestic situations, they earn for hours," so totally different from our country, for example, an announcement I read.
It was for workers, to go to work for the second, to the sixth.
For day, a week, much less, a month, eight in the morning, at 18 hours, earning 380 Brazilian reais, 300 and 80 Brazilian reals, this one, which is our condition here in Brazil, there are domestic ones who are being prevented from feeding themselves.
And then, I was very excited to live so many books, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, it's very expensive, and my mother, domestic, my father, I didn't have the conditions to buy the books I always wanted, and for my surprise, the Regina enters in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several tests in studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a story teacher, since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand, and said, "What am I doing?"
Conciliating the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and many class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," I wasn't the first one to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman, like me, and the person says, "Wow, it's very he's very heavy, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, right?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother was a domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I was also ready.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, then they called me at least one interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, that, and so on, "Are you really?"
Yes, or I'm magic ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say that what was the big house in the past are illusion apartments today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's almost the case of employee.
(Audience): Yes.
(Audience) Oh!
She came running, and I was nervous, because I kept waiting for her to get there, "You're on Friday of payment, I listened to her entering the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came," and it's the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I created it since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother's family was always going to work, I didn't have much time for her, it's the little box of the employee, it's Christmas, I'm seeing my best clothes, I was in the church, I stayed there with so much condoms.
Because Christmas and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take the copies of all the comforts.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and so I can escape from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, you won 1,800 Brazilian reais per month, you'll never win this value in another place."
Because my little kitchen is my penic, and then I was there, in this area of service, appealed to take my little bit of "Sovete" and made the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if the bathroom is happening, not because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the shower of the employee for that I brought little, because the modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of the employee, today I'm here, contrary to statistics, so some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, only the mother wasn't domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being seen, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause) (Applause) Peripheric.
(Applause) Women are flying, teacher, peripheric and rage.
My side ... (Applause)
I'm not here today.
Apparently, there are 6 million domestic women.
"What should I be here on my side?"
And that at some point they will be, everything I do would happen that my life is not thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one gives this idea of talking, we will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this job of domestic people is like private property, we can see it in the airports, why the nanny knows it's a nanny, but no, it's to leave clear, which are the places of some people in this country, so I'm here in the statistics - (Applause) I'm not talking to six million women and I'm talking to you!
I'm from African Axias and not forced.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) I'm here today to talk ... (Music)
about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, it was to disconnect.
Spread your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Until you're dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Who says that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally?
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself ...
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was deceived in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Go to the stage.
Open the word.
Take your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment, sponsors of inflammation.
The first past to destroy.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't realize it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside it.
From this feeling, of this moment of presence?
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not the anxious antecipation you have in front of you, you're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex.
You're a human being.
It's time for me to put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
It's much less.
It was a lot of anger.
It's not in the heart.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know that living was a big deal.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
Of all I had already experienced.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already experienced.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Do you remember?
Most of you?
He only stood his eye.
Several of you.
Think about it.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
Sleigh, come this space.
It's not about getting rid of you, it's unleasant.
Disconnected from cell phones ...
(Laughter) Put them on the floor, put their cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the ground.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were fighting for the notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection.
Who connects themselves is the human being?
Now...
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
For the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"No, I'm going to look at her in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss ... (Laughter)
He was connected, guys.
Let's go.
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
(Whispering) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are you really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
Isn't it scared?
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Do you look closed?
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the system of space location.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction center, there's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system ...
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Where are you?
Feel the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took a hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touching Chica.
You felt the temperature and took fingers to the Chicara's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected.
And feeling where are you?
Observe yourself.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Strange.
I said, "No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence?
Then you realize it.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become...
A habit in our lives?
These are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are technology of...
Time generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity, silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in a TED talk, who has had the first video, (Laughter) and, normally, is the first view.
It was my case.
I can say that it's an absurd evaluation of the speaker.
Audience: Yes!
Parents are so seductive that the idea of translating part of a demand of an angle and "fans of ideas."
They learned to translate into shared areas with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In the case of Brazil, the work of translation is fundamental, once only 5% of people according to public transportation.
And, at least, it has an influence in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
10% of them are Brazilians.
It was translated to 116 languages.
And almost always 6,000 translations made until the moment.
But we're only translated as we also transcribe the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx around the world.
But, as to allow people with hearing impairment, they can follow the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, my case wanted to be a Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be fertilized for me instead and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially, TED, with its own looptype, indicates, abandoned subjects with technology from TED, entertainment, which is "E," we can translate as an entertainment.
And I designed the people to refer to it.
Nowadays, talks approach an inferiority of subjects that will have disappointment or political, businesses, entrepreneurship.
Until literature.
We have, for example.
Let's talk about the forms of science.
Another of my passions is letting what the subject is this auditory accident.
It's that it's terrible that we have after us not only for our biggest expectation of life.
Like also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do of my hearing partner ...
It's translating and receiving as a bubble of talks in the ten-year-old environment.
And they can be the "self-prox" for these TEDx rocks, or the TV series are short educational videos, accessible to children.
Very small.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and the father is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be an electrode, you'll have it.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my age, because I'm a very anxious person.
Not only wanting to do this day of contract, but half an hour and hours a day, two or three hours passed by, this conversation with me and with the translators.
(Laughter) Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here receiving.
I'm a researcher.
But why do I think my impressive theme, because I think it's worth using my hearing accident?
(End of video) In initiatives like this, that TEDx.
(Applause)
(Applause) The second philosophical is the cold.
I opened the option of man in life.
Audience: Yes!
It gives light to this toilet and become what is empowered, that I don't have a doubt of education.
It's fundamental for that.
And there's also no doubt that education is fundamental for people, less privileged, with good crime, or excluded to our society.
They can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's the work of donation, whether I donate your time, whether I judge your knowledge.
Can you help an object?
Just because your volunteer work receives my choice, a mine decision.
I have to do the best possible and I have to commit myself.
To donate the time that a shadow is different from donating the rest of our time, the behavior of complex activity that demands not only to know the foreign language.
Our language.
And John Fomes, who is a youngest man, behind a well-being translation, has always a well-known knowledge.
A lot of research, a lot of work, many research hours.
And for us, a very fluent translation to be a scholarship, there's always a degree that I've tasted before.
And frustrated with the facts what?
The best thing you do, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved almost undefinitely.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, they will make the majority.
But, despite this, we create for the quality of our translations, not only regarding the speaker, but in respect to those who are going to watch it, right?
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers, so they finally be approved by a coordinator or a coal coordinator.
Or, as we call it "healthy".
In the case of Brazil, in the Brazilian Portuguese, we have Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories, "We have the IBM, we have Maricene.
Claudia, and me?
We have our parents, who are because of my nose, liked it.
October or luck, and Rafael ...
(Whispering)
Audience: Yes!
(Audience) Yes.
(Applause)
Very well, this obsession I have with education has to do not only with Brazil, which lives a deep political crisis in which education is connected to the second bread, but without seeing my own personal history.
(Video) My father, who, today, was two years old, got hurt for primary course.
Despite that, he knew how to understand well and make the four procrastinations in very well mathematics.
And the dream of this was to always be able to study the reading because I'm studied.
And making children study, that's why the gay who lived in our neighbor's neighbor called "Iobeiras."
He decided to change his four children at the time, I pay a lot of obstacles, the biggest city we live in.
In some slides, my father had sold his beginning his logic to the Uber, and his sixth.
Knowing that, also, as a commercial, they had a small hat from a presence store, they had invested years.
(Laughter) However, in 1964, as a great presence in Brazil, it became this reception and other reasons, as my father was the false, and it really lost, without anything, that I've been killing each other with the nine seeds.
(Audience talking) A lot felt as humiliated by his boyfriend and my father decided, after paying his debates, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold mother, playing back, eating well liked to drive.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who today has 90 years old, isn't it?
On the other hand, they're waiting for Parai's young people to go to the bus station.
It was an excellent kitchen, a training supported, my "about" and she decided to do "condicks" to sell.
So, for many years in my house, "Poor de queijo," it was literally "canio Paulo," "Give this disguise to the best peoples in the horizon."
(Applause)
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and my father didn't give up, it was that we were destroyed to study.
Audience: Yes!
And that's how it was done: a big fact without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data from the national research penalty for samples or homicides.
In the 48-year-old bills, at 60 years old in Brazil?
Only 32% of people with greater personality than me.
And this obsessed, this passion, that my father came to education?
Transparentia?
In the worst days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting me.
As a result, when we were seven years old, at that time, we were going to college entrance exams.
He put me and thought, "I didn't want to ask for a job or not, he came to him and for any visit to appear without a house."
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering the words.
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get there shaking.
Without knowing, he was living in a little like this talk here, and anyway.
I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we managed more than that today, we managed to give our children as better dreams than we had, right?
And here I say, for me, the greatest passion in my life, in my plan, many are my beloved dreams, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
The parents, I doubt, put this as a chair to give the newspaper to me.
But for whom I asked all the nights.
In the stories of the audience?
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincident who, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the creative educator, revolutionary ideas that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite the limited conditions, despite the discovery of our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiative is the TEDx, just like my father was such a simple way, inspired us.
Just like today, it was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
That make us believe that, despite all.
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So they taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when they returned to classes, I started to be surrounded, in some classes, and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I stopped buying a rule, which is a little girl who allows me to write in Braille, where you can, in the cause, that shows the release.
I ended up full of my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that affected me.
While I wrote her that I was learning, I didn't give tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "maker" course in the "Coyation da Cruz."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what we taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet and be ready when it's in the motors, and then we'd have a clock, but saw that there was no Internet: we decided to create robotics, programming, teachers.
We tried to create a clock, so we took the engines, connected with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes, in Braille, so you can feel.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others, from what it was taught to us, for a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake up and didn't happen, but at least a month ago we ended the clock, and the translator in Braille was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from our interest could help in our aunt and potentially many other people.
And this has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
(Applause) So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, and there's still a lot to be done to help people ... (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask you a question.
What do you think?
The agudas people.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
(Applause) Put your handkerchief.
(Audience) Yes!
Okay, we're all in agreement: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a mountain exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And the other hand, with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces, receive their clients in apartments, in hotels, or even street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about what I'm here to talk about, and I'm not going to talk about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve us 16 years or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and additionally, and the links must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
in sexual version of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, this inherent volunteer institution and forced constitution.
In other words, we're not going to talk about sexual traffic situations, the tendency to confuse prostitution, drug traffic, sexual exploration, is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
(Laughter) Investigations have shown that, in Portugal, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact, they are phenomena that identify us, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traits.
Human.
Almost all of them for plural exploration, victims for sexual duration.
Only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify a judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
A lot of ugly.
Sturated.
And there's something waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't correspond to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
I also have all the people, the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of strangements that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator enters interviews, I talk to people who do sexual work, what they say is that they will be an option.
As a pondrated option, after equating the advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destined to disagree and not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
(Laughter) In mind, when they think of a person who prostitute themselves.
Think about it.
Okay, and I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or in a woman of Malaspet and of Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city?
Because it's very likely a lack of water and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
Deperactics?
Of the experiences, not all the people with positive experiences, but not all the people have negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women foreign, they are not just women driving, there are also many women foreign in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped, when we think about the prostitution from it.
From someone on the street, I tell you that the studies that are a lack of facts.
And the Western cities.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century, tell us that...
Please stand up.
Because it will only represent 20% of us.
"The total of depositual people."
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
In other words, they are less, they are minority, but they are not negligentable.
I'm going to give you the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, an integral study, men, women, trans people, and that, in all the country, found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated, so when the speech does about the victim of a man or a teacher, forget that it's a percentage of men who are there.
In sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, medicine.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex.
The idea is based on this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences in the midst of non-violental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with the people who are already sex, and that indicate that this law blocks the violence in the best risk.
It's the stigma and the disease.
(Audience): Yes.
Another idea we all have is that this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
(Laughter) They are victims.
It's an idea that, without big study in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea of what client has a criminality.
For an idea that I think is ideologically invested, even because research has shown that relationships have shown.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of connecting clients is dehuman.
Because they are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure, and many of them can make sex professionals run.
There are even countries.
That has the fungal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is someone who receives train to know how to have sexual relationships with people who are special carriers.
And I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroys any argument that tries to be favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of your life to do it.
In their economic needs?
Thank you very much.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done you."
It was controlled by work commissions.
If this can be done without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the one hand, has a sexuality and it's considered legitimate.
On the other hand, we have a sexuality and considered illegitimate, normal and natural.
It's normal, anti-natural, and that's where the sex begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and natural, is at the base of the statement, of the description of people who do this activity: stigma is a form of violence that is at the base of so much discrimination about sex observers.
Like, for example.
When they drive into institutions in the field of action, justice and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way, now, every month I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on the woman.
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
In other words, the stigma of puta divide women in two types, tied and downloaded, seriously and not seriously, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta is an instrument that is prescribed, norms that are prescribed socially, that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that's at the service of the feminine sexual sexual sexuality, it's a kind of punish stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do we think we can do any one, we can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex players?
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, which has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's challenging the stigma that I'm here doing at this moment and giving voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempt to the most seen attempt silencing throughout time didn't let them say, "We don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow."
Audience: Yes.
After all this ...
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you (Applause)
(Applause) I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cured, art, cured, being a doctor.
It was the power of a fundamental letter.
In the medium relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to get involved, spiritually, in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have there, empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical resource.
It's a technical judgment and for me to play.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationship of our time, with all the most superficial and rare, I saw that the book is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
It's different to see.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
From "elite Branca," I thought I was going to take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indius, the Indius said goodbye.
I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood.
To relate to someone who needed to know how to do, and to be able to offer that person that involvement to that love, this attention.
He's polar.
The ones of this convention, the request of floor, the time, or the ship.
All the doctors that come with us and focus on it.
And Rocis.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to our daily practice.
The simplification that happens there can be replied here too.
It's the mouth that she needs to promise the Amazon to discover this, it's the path I've been able to cover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of medical college.
Have you made a list of objective toys all over the world?
The first goal is there.
Altruism?
It's going to be good.
These same students, at the end of the medical curtain.
With the same research?
Just because the climate of success is knowledge.
It's cured.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we took someone who had a brilliant, poetic stadium, and we handed someone in a technician who knew a lot about medicine and didn't know anything about people.
The concern with old and patient relationships is based on the past.
In Greece, which is the fish in medicine, where the father, the medicine that is poor, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before.
When Adão, in Gasmokamaçã, the Eva desengastated, and this was to make a terrible aviary, it's what we do until today, I don't touch the same thing.
So why is the address considered, instead, to medicine, and little father teaches me why for the first time?
There's a method there.
It can be an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, retrodesized, replicated.
And in a way that the development of these people had a logic.
In that song too, it was developed, it was created a poca's isolation.
And even today, it's used in medicine shapes, in the world, it was done in a certain corner of Christ, people in a picture, OK?
They're words very complex, and I've prepared three words here.
In all the houses that entered, I just talked about the benefits of the diseases.
Exiting all bad volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and sisters.
Of course, what they saw is respecting the life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
It's respecting this judgment and not violating, it would be the dignity of equation between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today you do a journey?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered with honor judgment.
And, in this case, I gave a work to participate in a transition that is registered to a John's judgment.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a debt to produce science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So today, a patient has a team of doctors because he could have a class, and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot, encouraging this and losing the patient's cure.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group class, like teachers.
And I tricked with the teachers, "Look, patients, there's thomography, resonance, and enthusiasm."
I'll look for your belly, you're at home of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called everyone and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
He looked and had tapes on the dog's finger and noticed that he was smoking and saying that he didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth, and he showed that he had emagressed.
When you're on the loss, it's light and dose, you can dress.
The neighbors are able to take care of their own clothes, a deaf person, you can talk a lot, "The time you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy, you can remember something that doesn't give us any consultation," and I said, "If all this didn't convince us?"
Besides, as you're seeing, patients.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're trying to deal with it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're wearing the black because you want to do the kiss, that you're paying attention to him, leave your care.
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, who are appealed, better at a fastest time.
More and more, it increases a number of functional diseases, our means, the same functions, a house where we don't know why it appears.
I don't have exam operation, I don't have external interactions, I don't have Haluty, I don't see anything, the diseases are like this.
In other words, what happens if our society is a little sick?
Some of you may raise your hand and say, "Well, very interesting, you'll talk about the same patient's relationship.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are talking to me.
What you're going to talk about for a medical group, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two steps.
In the months, there are two.
It's time for us to stop, who knows we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our curve process.
And it's not only to look for healthy life, but also to engage your cure process in the decisions of the cure trace.
To do this, the first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where we give the Dr. Google's talk, which is fashionable, when I was a child, there were many students, there was a book from health, and that existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's an editor, you had to have content to say, "Today, with Google, you have a very good information lesson, very important, but many times, very bad."
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
In fact, today's information is usually assigned.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter with my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they'll allow me for anything, that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, or video games, or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing, didn't believe in basic things, the radiators, "Look, medicine changed, now your problems have finished seriously."
Differently a lab with a scientist will have an immediate discovery, without the scientific society not killing this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody is doing anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my doctor, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid channel like the industry, you don't want you to get out of it.
You're low, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
The idea is the solution: discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information is not equal knowledge, information is a knowledge, it takes information, it participates actively in its cure, but it discusss the average cost.
Secondly, it's very important to be active in a process of cure nation.
It's asking, demanding, knowing.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine serves.
There's a right to know the risk of that surgery: "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to understand me, I work 20 years later."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture to exist, to exist, it's not to get there, fighting with all the teacher, it's not this, it's to slowly know.
There is, if composing with time, we'll make the atendments be different.
The methods want this: they want to have the right.
They don't want to be tried for a long time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once I was in Amazonia, in the tenderness of her, she was a mountain, and she was a mother.
And we had a patient there, he had a thought cancer.
There's a lot of humor.
Thank you very much.
And there wasn't any orologist with us, to bring them to São Paulo, to be treated in the future of cancer.
Please.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, the doctor, who obviously didn't speak Germany, didn't speak Portuguese, was a idol.
I had a translator, I was the son who said very little, because that's how it was very bad.
He was obviously scared.
And I belonged to a question.
And for me, it would give us a scene of a movie.
The Indius was the doctor.
That's how it works.
Isn't it?
The summer was bread.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
What kind of individual?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture than the other person.
I gave the soul to that other individual, I had all the interest of taking care of it.
This magic that wants the art of cure.
So you don't need to behave very hard, it happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking that there are doctors attending in prototypes, in ambulants, in consultants, and so, at the bus.
What's going on?
One.
Listening to the moon.
It's curating, understanding.
So?
We, doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
It's more guilt.
All patients.
To be active in your pure process.
And that makes me feel a connection.
I want the world to be better, and you'll be more well treated, what's difficult.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
