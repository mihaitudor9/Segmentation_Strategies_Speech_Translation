Have you ever thought about it?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should my role as an inclusive fashion stylist?
Is it to create a vestuary?
Thank you all.
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009.
When I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
"And the vestuary?"
For wheelchairs.
I talked about it.
With different women, even with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
When they lost a lot of time, they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist?
That was it.
To make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it.
A cause with high-cost, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I placed veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface.
Obviously, I didn't put my back on my back because I didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena.
A blouse that had openings in the shoulders.
a pressure button.
To facilitate, at the time, to pass the head.
That's it.
For people who are quadriplegics, the ideal.
It's thinking of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics, that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a website.
I came in ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position.
To give more comfort.
She says it's visually impaired.
I did a dress that she could use in many ways, below, under top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information.
Like size and color of the piece.
That's it, it's dynamism.
For women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
We thought about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
For them, they don't need to find the ideal clothes.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news?
It's that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products.
Like colorful wheelchairs.
Are they ready and stuck?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world, which is already in the best edition.
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
What are the big companies?
Famous and conceived brands that realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections, like Latin American.
She was already in her second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But what about the future?
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal.
Our differences.
Thank you.
My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it's going through an adult.
My community started to work with the audience.
I was designing people, "How?
collect garden, know how to separate each other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was winning the parents' awareness.
(Laughter) The parents who were catching me delivering the children.
People recognize me in the community.
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community?
We have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
I'm working with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
There, I met a plant called her name of Engar, it's a luminous plant.
And we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers fast and soil.
And all the quantum plants.
How many below it, we have a good result.
And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met.
That all plants ...
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
So, you have to imitate the forest, why?
In the arm.
I had a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them.
It's various: there I have the Cup, Graviola, Andyroba, Coppaíba.
with Moru, Guaraná.
And everything, there, doesn't give up.
There, we eat.
There, everything was natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
My mother breaks.
And the fruit on the side?
Five comparison for us.
In our community, we work there, everything with organic.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxic in our communities, OK?
(Laughter)
Is it to compare the human being?
Like an animal.
The child compared it and said, "You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children."
I'm paying and I'm listening to this tension.
Then he talks to the animal quote, so I compare the child like this.
And to deal with human beings?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
Mom is cared for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the eye, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person.
That I observed my house.
I kept observing my house and ...
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's OK.
And today we have it.
A job inside?
The lungs of the human being.
"Shut up, don't you take it?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, for those who don't know what's far from the human being, it's the Amazon tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river, what before?
I had a dam.
In front of you.
It's like this a little of our community.
And...
This dam hasn't been there.
It ended up with the river.
And today we have the "repovuando Vio."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're achieving.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
I've always liked the forest.
I went through people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel?
It's typical.
Respire a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ...
It's always talking to people educating children.
And ...
It's going through other people.
And I have the message to leave here.
A phrase that she's very little?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come to us and come to us.
Are we talking about it and making people?
I'm very happy.
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely, and thank you very much, guys.
I'm gay.
I got married with a name, I had two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
My family and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
What would I do with that family?
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
That's it.
It puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you are here, as we feel.
It's like a fear that loses our child.
And we had two options.
It founded us, cried, or...
To solve, fight.
Creating, ugly, strength, and continuing looking for a hatred to flat.
Parallel can make a transplant of the metro, which is what it needs to be cured.
And then?
It was very incredible because all the most schools, and all the most friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all the place, taking people to play blood, medules, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
What when ...
A child scares you.
The risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns.
They matter it.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
We learned this lesson.
And it was spreading for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, saying, "It's true, it doesn't matter the problem I had."
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement found a donor.
That's it.
What about people?
They saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
(Laughter) It's not a family that's called, that's supposed to be equal to all these families, why not?
In the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is that I love the family, this union, that gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that the other thing happened to us.
With this disease, for the world?
And what?
Neither blood, nor medule, anxiety.
They were able to manufacture them.
Our manufacture.
The blood is blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human.
Then he stood up that awareness.
We have this ability.
Dedoing blood for those who need it, and knowing is not just that.
For someone who has a house, I don't know.
The blood is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all things are necessary.
And donating medula ossea, getting scared as the owner of medula ossia, to the chances of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one.
about 100,000 people, so if you...
Or to save life, it's as if it earns mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get a bit of the stars.
Ah, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in my life without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to save in my life, and that's what's the message.
Or so credit?
It happens to all of us, I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for this union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, we are not going to save life as credit, but for having that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in the law.
It's good for you.
Don't be like you.
This is deafness.
No, that's it.
My name is ...
The word is the Chinese.
I'm serious.
It was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I'm an engineer.
I studied at Damasco's university.
Today.
I'm stuck.
Not like that.
With my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Warabi, I'm a little crazy.
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today.
I'm going to talk about it.
What bothers me the most.
"Broken sex."
Guys, there's a slam.
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do like this.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was 26 years old.
Three million people.
And it keeps.
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three kilos of clothes.
A sculptor of Engineering.
Two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamasco.
I liked traveling.
And she loved it.
To know the world.
Follow.
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day.
It started the war.
March 15.
It's 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities.
From the country.
My city in Damasco.
It was the safer one in Syria.
I had a job, a winner.
It's 25.
Pombas.
Hello.
What a good thing!
And five years of war.
My country is this.
Strói.
People, who know me, were forced to carry.
Oh, Cadaba!
From your children.
They found their wives.
Very and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiars.
I'm looking.
And they didn't vote.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it was going back home.
"When are you going to work?"
I went to see my family again.
Or not.
Today.
Millions of Syrian will drink everything.
They are dead or they flee in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad.
When do we have to leave Syria?
Today, noise, noise, and our life will be behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still lives there.
I don't know if I'll come.
They, again.
To protect my family.
I went to Bara Bahirut.
Well, ten months ...
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So?
I went to talk to Baixada Brasileira.
And they wish São Paulo.
It was the best age.
To go to Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
And you, Apinas.
A week to leave behind.
I've been living for 40 years.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was.
With a lot, today I have a daughter.
"Brazilian."
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well.
The kitchen that my scholarships talked about.
I'll give you the kitchen.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created "Dagina no Facebook" or "Talada comida Syria," that's why now.
Everything has a pen and paper.
It's left, it's a number, it's true, it's true.
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world ...
I was closed.
For us.
Etrest, who, on the end of the war and attacks.
Two tourists.
Many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow here.
Or a journalist says, "Me?"
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, talk.
Or contact.
Like OMAPSOI.
A human being.
Let's do it!
"I love blood."
It's allowed to kill religion's name.
But exactly ...
Oops!
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us.
Or Syrian.
Islamic State is an organization.
The terrorist, who is taking the image of the slam.
A religion.
It's based on it.
Or Alcurão.
I'm not a book.
Sagrado says that kills a person.
While she had killed another, dared corruption, a land, and how all men killed, all men, and who read their lives, will be like the darkness of your mother to see chicken 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Sunitarian Muslim.
How am I?
My life in Brazil.
He showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
Children of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When do you see a woman using Ri Jabi?
That silence that covered my hair, like my wife, was my wife.
They ask questions, "How?"
Why do you use excellence?
With this heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline desirai Jabi.
Today, they lift other rules.
Men in Molière.
"I'm not going to have to play."
To embrace.
Awesome!
Except you of wedding.
Some people wish me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Kebeijam is the operation.
Beijambson, Tao islam, they have those rules, more.
Or will each person want to eat or not?
The debt is well broken, some things to be.
The same way they have grown up that they don't obey you.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane and in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Oh, it's PCSO.
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
"Why?"
Because these things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam later.
That agency is explained to people always.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Teacher, Mohamat Dés."
We must respect all religions.
Because all people have the same value.
Why should we have it?
Believe me.
With everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians.
Hi, Lanta Béndez.
That we must help the people they need.
Every year we have Alsaka and we give it.
Two, five, four hundred.
All our money for people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystalos or Jewish.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
It was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
To end.
With "O-brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
These are your children.
Valbuder, growing.
Together, based.
Oh, that's the molecule!
In the small stories of life.
They come to recite my rhythms.
In the Sun of the Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always willing to not give up the love of who.
I hope it always reaches.
Who always believes in cancer?
I don't even believe it.
Right with hope.
But in the daily lap, I know who I am.
"Let's do food," "My salary ends," "What's this race?"
Studying a girl was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot of hands.
Cozinheiros?
Fascinera.
What didn't hire me in the mall?
I don't understand this, if I had so much to pay a secret course.
But who enters the office?
Opa, sorry, I had an event among the movies.
It's cleaning everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation.
The EME is to be a domestic.
If it were for the option, I have many friends who are already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity.
And the lunch says to me.
You follow this corridor.
It goes straight, turns the left, enters the little box that the vastor is suspicious, it's welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011.
I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, "I've been a maid."
The page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 and this year still didn't complete four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at home.
Differences.
Last day by day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook?
Or the day.
I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Menina, you can't do it!"
It's tomorrow, it's my new day.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
Because I was a domestic employee for seven years.
Then I warned the guys, "Look, guys.
"He came to me in the memory, some reports will start."
To bet this on Facebook, and use the hashtag and domestic employee, so that, in this case, other people have already gone through this too, and then they can stay following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For my surprise.
In less than 24 hours, this became very rare.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as domestic in the city of Santos, this in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from...
My food is the same food I did.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use the code.
In her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
There was a bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, I compatted.
This first story on the Internet became very rare.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
What I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last history, and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to several media.
So much the international media, the national media.
Several London, TV Dábio aleman, and several years.
What was I really surprised?
When I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
Then they managed to compose each other and I started to talk.
And these stories, because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
The domestics are more valued, they earn.
For hours, for hour, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces.
It's a job announcement that I titled "How abusive announces," for example.
The announcement I read.
It was for workers.
It's to go to work for a second.
"Thank you."
From 8 am.
At 18.
Giving 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, a month.
380 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestic ones going through these conditions still today, there are domestic ones that are being prevented from feeding themselves, and they don't win the bathroom, and they suffer from all these atrocities that I've always mentioned in the page.
And then I was very excited to live so many books and I started to say, "This became a daily practice, so what I did when I arrived at her house, I'd gather all my little father, I didn't have the conditions to buy the books I wanted, and soon when I arrived at home, I'd take a half an hour to clean the TV.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting down deliciating myself with those books, and for my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe "pálida," I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And, knowing about the experiences I had already spent in the past, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several tests and study, I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a story teacher, since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing?"
Counciling the university.
With the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was solved, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and many class friends who help me, I summarize some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make tests, which is very difficult to concilate, a totally heavy job.
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the Brazilian traditional family to show that slavery hasn't yet ended.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first Sindicato of the Domestics, all this when I eat, and I come here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
(Laughter) Why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this one?
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I was going to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I also work in Brazil.
I would also pass because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with photo and good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me at least a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, and that's it, and then you are.
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are luxury apartments today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today: modern senzala.
It's almost the case of employee.
She got there.
I ran away, and I was nervous because I was waiting for her a long time to get there, "You're on the sidewalk, opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came."
She's already with a clothes away, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, forgotten to take her money, second wooden fair, it's the kitchen of the employee."
My girl, I created it since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered, I was there, I only wanted to see her married, "I'm this, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage, because the woman of my patterns are having fun, everyone happy."
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because the modern sixth.
It's the little box of the employee, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work, and then the only solution I had was to take off the copies of all the comforts.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and so I can escape from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change my friends and say, "Menina, you're winning 1,8 milk per month, you'll never win this value in another place."
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of sorvete, because my little pot is my penic, and I was there.
In the service room, I woke up and took my little bit of sovet and sixth number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if you use the bathroom, and I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought the modern senzala?"
It's the kitchen of the employee, "Today I'm here."
I would find statistics for some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are."
Your grandmother wasn't domestic, only the mother wasn't domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda... (Applause) Happy.
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and raft.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic illnesses.
What should I be here on my side?
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic people are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking, and will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why does the nanny know it's a nanny, but it's not to leave, of course, which are the places of some people in this country, so I'm here in the statistics - I'm not talking to you, and I'm talking to you, millions of dolls.
Sound Africans and unforgetted.
I'm here today to talk.
about silence.
which is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, first to disconnect.
Leave your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Because I'm scared.
If you are photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself.
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing eight, this is the conceptive energy of my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
Have you ever started?
I was feeling many pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "That's it.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's follow.
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Give the pair.
It opens the word.
It's inside your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment.
Spoint the inflammation points.
The first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book.
And I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos, of this situation.
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have credits, there's no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It's in Cuba.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know they lived a lot of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
Everything I had already experienced.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
I was there.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
To determine my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to delegate your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
Just keep your eye.
Several of you.
Think about it.
No, I don't need.
Others justified their importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
Wow!
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You're connected.
Come space.
It's not to get rid of you, it's to slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor, (Laughter) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed.
You are not connected.
You've taken close to you, the tool.
Sternal collection.
Who connects themselves is the human being.
"And now?"
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
Propal.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Look at her face."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss."
AC: He was connected, guys.
See!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
"Yes."
Listen ... (Expiration) close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Close your legs, knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
Isn't it scary?
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of me.
Until this moment, with much more fear than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember this one.
From the approximate dimensions to the salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space localization system.
We wake up, a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system.
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took fingers to the Asa da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a connected vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What a black man, the area you hear.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality is new, it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
It's realizing it.
That much of what we do is to be determined.
What we've already seen.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence?
And a state of presence that decorates from it.
It can become.
A habit in our lives.
These are self-knowledge technologies.
Question.
On the planet, along with our productive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection happens when you communicate.
Authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
She had the first video.
I can say that I'm a fan."
I had a demand of a legion of "Fanse Idete."
What did they sell to bring society?
Books, colleagues, their family.
Once there are only one.
It has an influence in the same time.
How is it like that?
The translator thought.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
10% of them are Brazilians.
16 and young people.
And almost always 6,000 translations made at the moment.
We received it.
The talks made in events like these here.
But compare to allow people with hearing impairment.
The first one is transcribed.
Germaine: Germaine, Germaine?
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially?
It's like the logotipo indicates.
In topics such as "technology," "Entrortinment," which is the "e" we can translate as a entertainment.
And you leave.
Paulo was referred to it.
Those who come from accidents or collective, political, businesses, entrepreneurship.
To you, literature.
There are talks that evolve the smells.
The theme is this inventive DNA.
It's that terrible time we have.
On the other hand, the reduction.
I said, "My God, I'm 21."
It's also about getting into account the bubble.
In the North East of ten.
And it can be.
They're alive, educational, short, even children's children.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do this day and show you it alone.
Not only because I had such antarctic people, as I'm getting here at this event.
But why do I think I have precious people?
I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
In these actions, how is it?
To get back to who?
That it's potentially because I don't have a doubt and education.
And they also have a tube: "What do you do?"
Can they integrate themselves from the future?
And when is the fish and the volunteer work?
Whether it's your knowledge.
Because I always choose a mine, a mine decision.
And it tries to commit myself.
There's the time left.
It's different from the same.
And it's called "Fongs," a young destiny.
On the other hand, a perfect translation.
There's always.
The only knowledge has a lot.
The world research.
A lot of work, a lot of verticality.
For us, a translation like this, fluent, pleasant, too.
And frustrated, with facts, what?
Or better than it does, it can always do it better.
Because the text can be a million people.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, they are the majority.
All these translations and transcessions.
Or as we call it "DC."
I want to judge Portuguese and Portuguese because it's very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
Do you like PEMA?
Audience: Yes.
I have to hear it.
What a living in the air?
A deep political crisis, isn't it?
My father, who, today, had been two years if he was living, got a primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write well and do it.
And the dream of him was always power.
And to make the children come up.
That's why the one who lived in our little kitchen called Tairobeiras.
And, on the contrary, my father had sold his beginning his logic, his fears, and his cycle.
If you knew, as a commercial, he had a small hotel in a presence store, he was investing in it.
In 1964.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in your homes.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his father's name, and my father decided.
My mother, who, today, is 90 years old, isn't it?
It was a wisdom of cooking.
Sclusion of training.
She decided to do tickets to sell.
Ponte queijo was interally internal.
Despite we don't have to eat many times, we didn't want to dress from a website.
It's that we're disturbing to study.
That's how it works.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it's already condemned to the penalty of the National Parliament of the homicides.
Or exception, this fascination, this passion for my father had for education?
What did they look like?
"When you're crazy, you're in the country, you're in a club, you're in a bubble, the bank visits you're going to appear in the house."
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get there shaking.
Without knowing, he was training.
There are better conditions than we've had, right?
And here I say, for me, the greatest passion in my life, in my greatest opinion, are my beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident, coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, became teachers.
At some point in life.
And one of the brothers is the educator, yes, absolutely fantastic, creative.
Interprets, revolutionary ones, what applies?
So ...
The only message I can leave here today is that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion with initiatives is TEDx?
There's a kick.
I'm part of what TEDx, just like my father, was such a simple management.
Don't inspire yourself.
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had her first contact with Braille.
A alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So he taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when I returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to Brazil.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule.
It's a little machine that allows us to describe it in arms.
In the roof, you write that you show the release.
I ended up full of my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threw me to the roots.
While I wrote her that I was learning, I still gave tips.
And with this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Crown School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet, we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But saw that there was no Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to create a clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake and nothing happened.
We wrote everything, disconnected and gathered everything and started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock.
And we showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
They encouraged us to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help inclusion, and potentially many other people.
And this has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet, and let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students in high school, who haven't ended.
In high school, we're second year and we're teenagers, we managed to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help you.
Let me ask you a question.
What does it hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Please raise your hand.
Thank you.
OK, we're all in agreement: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
Is the only difference, the main difference?
With sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a volunteer exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients, apartments, hotels, or even street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
That's what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases who involve it.
Children.
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve less than 16 years or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggressions of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer institution and forced constitution.
I'm also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations.
The tendency is to confuse prostitution against sexual exploration.
In other words, taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
In other words, research has shown that falls Portugal.
The phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is little expressive: they are phenomena that don't identify themselves, but that can be included.
And to have a notion.
What I just told you is that the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks 118 victims.
Human.
Almost all of them for likely exploration.
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
There are only three.
Of course, it's going to be listening to the only victim.
To justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
Because there's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
Like victims.
Very ugly.
Sturated.
And there's something that expects someone to save them.
But this doesn't correspond to reality.
Or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequality.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of constraints.
That influenced the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator enters interviews, I talk to people who do sexual work, what they say is that they were an option.
A pondrated option, after decorating the advantages and disadvantage, which is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly witnessed and is not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately.
(Laughter) In mind, when you think of a person who is replaced.
Think about it.
I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely to the lack of appearance and, of course, has someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Duratic.
Of the experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped, when we think about the prostitution from there.
Does anyone in the street?
I say that the studies that are made fuel.
Western cities.
They try to estimate the number of people who are in this century.
Plete Saint-Drois.
What will it represent only 20% of us?
It's the total of deposited people.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
That is, they are less.
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
I'm going to give you the data of the study done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the teacher Sônia Dias, from Lisboa University.
And that interviewed 140 sec workers, both in the context of the street, as in the countryside context, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2 percent men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does about the victim and the man or the teacher, forget that it's a percentage.
Men are there.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed, deep down, because it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the crime idea.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex, but it's believed.
To buy mistakes.
The idea is based on this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, they're victims of an oppressor or the client, and so we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-violental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with the people who are already sex, and that indicate that this law puts the safety of violence.
To the stigma.
And the disease.
That's it.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Audience: Yes.
It's a decent that, without big study in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea of what client has a criminality.
It's a idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between us.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of criminalizing clients is dehumana.
Because they are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure, and many of them can make sex professionals even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is: someone who receives train to know how to have sexual relationships.
With people who are disabled and I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
It's about the relevance of sexual work, and now it's a moment that tries to be favored.
One of the customer criminalization.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them, it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Thank you.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
It was found on the work conditions.
If this can be done.
Without more exploration than in the workplace, why do we continue?
To condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is, "What?"
What about moral?
And specifically moral?
Sexual, which divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, he had a security and considered.
Egitimate.
"Normal."
It's natural.
And we have a sexuality considered illegitimate.
It's normal, anti-natural, and that's where the process begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is in the basis of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction, of devalization of deep discourse.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences: stigma, humanize, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination about sex generators, like, for example.
And when they drive in situations in the field of justice and social security, they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
In other words, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
In other words, the stigma of puta divide women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of the feminine sexual sexual security control, it's a kind of smoking behavior that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior disorder, normally, it's the risk of smelling the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
But what are we?
What do I think we can do any of us to make so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of basic policies based on scientific evidence, which has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's challenging.
How am I here doing this moment and giving voice?
Listening sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempt of the most distant attempts of silencing throughout time didn't let them say, "We don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow."
Audience: Yes!
After all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it's useful?
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cure art, healing to be a doctor.
It was the power of a fundamental letter.
In the medium relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and for me to play.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship with our time, with all the most superficial and rare, I'm this equilibrium suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, they were also there in several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
From "elite Branca," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian.
"Yes, Missispiè."
When I got there, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer that person that involvement to that love.
The ones who convince this, the request of indigenous and oral, or naive.
All the doctors who come with us from there.
And Rocks.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
The simplification that happens there can be replied here too.
It's the grandmother who doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
It was the path I had to cover.
That, at the beginning of medical college, if you give a list of objective to students, the first objectives are.
Altruism?
"You're fine."
At the end of the medical course.
With the same research?
The topic of success is knowledge.
I'm sure.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we got someone who had a brilliant and poetic stadium.
And we delivered someone technical, who knew a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The concern?
One, old relationship with patients, a medicine is the remote of the past.
In the church, which is the fish in medicine, where the father, the medicine that is poor, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before.
When Adão, in Gasboa Maçã, Eva used to draw the fool, this was to do a loss air, it's what we do until today, it doesn't touch the same thing, (Laughter) So why does the church consider, instead, to teach me, because it was the first time, to have a goal?
It can be called art, healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated, and in a way that the development of these people had a logic.
In that song, it was also developed, it was created in a Poca's army.
That even today is used in medicine shapes.
It's the world.
It was done in a certain corner of Christ, I'm in a school.
You're talking about the complex media, and you've said three words.
In all the houses that entered, I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, especially the seduction of women, of men, of children and of the brains.
That's why they saw the respectant life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respect this judgment and not the violin, it would be the tip of enjoying interpretation between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already in that time, if I worry about this, and still today, you do the surgery?
We do judgment of things that we transgridate.
Because it has to be transcribed.
Because the best patient's relationship is essential for good care.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered by a man's judgment.
And, in this case, I took a work of participating in a transition that is registered for a joke program.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a individual to produce science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer able to absorb all knowledge.
So today, a patient has a team of doctors who take care of a class, and this class is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this and losing the patient's height.
There's a current theory that says, "Sami can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class, in college, in small groups, as a teacher.
And ...
I tricked to do these ladies, patients, Tomography, resonance, and microscopy, ultrason.
I put my hand in their belly, I wasn't in faces of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called the class and said, "Let's see the barrier."
He looked at Nietzsche de Tapá as a patient's finger and noticed he was smoking in front of us and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth, and he showed he had emagreated.
If our smartphones are crazy, if you can see them, you're able to take care of your own clothes, a deaf person, you can talk a lot, "Oh, the time you're wearing a patient, you're a moment of intimacy, you're able to remember something that doesn't take us!"
Besides, as you're seeing, patient.
He's answering to you, "The vulnerable area, he's telling you to deal with him."
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "Don't verbally see him, that you have to take care of him, and you're watching him, because you want to see him well, and he's asking him to take care of you.
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to have a selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, they're appealed, they improve, but they have a higher range.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, a house where we don't know why it appears.
There's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no ray of things, there's a symptom.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little, right?
Some of you have already said goodbye.
It's very interesting to talk about the best relationship with the patient.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a patient is to be passive.
Why are we talking about this to me?
What you're not going to talk about for a medical group.
After all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two there.
In the doctors, against two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, passive, and we have to take our hands into our cure process.
Do you do this?
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where we give the Dr. Google's talk, which is fashionable, when I was a child, there were many students, there was a book of health, and that existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, for you to talk to someone, publish something, because it's a editor, you had to have content to say, "Today, with Google, you have a very good information lesson, very good."
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the ability to filter.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
It's a funny action, usually assigned.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for anything, this doesn't matter, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, they live in war.
The city.
Second very important thing: you don't believe in good things, you're delighted, "Look, medicine has changed, now your problems have finished seriously."
Differently, a lab with a scientist will have an immediate discovery without the scientific society doesn't mature this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third.
If there's a paranoid thing like this, the industry doesn't have any interest in it.
I don't know for Baching, I'm going to dominate education.
It's hardly some other with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
I want the information, discuss your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and development.
Take the information, take part in your cure, but disculp your mother.
Secondly, it's very important to be active in action for security.
To ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know who you receive that medicine.
There's a right to know what the risk of that surgery is, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I work 20 years later."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture to exist, it's not to get there, fight with a whole teacher, it's not that.
Slowly, to know.
It's to demand.
To position time, we'll go.
It's to make the atendments be different.
The method you want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to have this time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, even in Venezuela, it was a mountain, nobody was a mother.
And we had a patient there, he had a pen cancer.
A moon.
"Yes."
There wasn't any orologist, there were people from Austria to São Paulo to be treated here in the future of cancer.
And, after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany her trash.
The doctor, obviously, didn't speak Germany, didn't speak Portuguese, was still.
I had a translator, I was the son, the boy who spoke very much about Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was obviously enjoying it.
And I belonged to a question.
The Indius, the doctor, you're like this.
Thank you.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interests of taking care of it.
This magic, because it's the art of healing.
So you don't need to behave very hard, it happens.
At that moment, we say, "I have one."
The labs and the consultants.
We, guys.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
There's no excuse.
All patients.
To be active in your cure process.
I wanted to make it a connection.
To live the world, but it improves, and you'll be more well treated than that.
(Applause) Well, guys, I'd like to talk to the world: 35,000.
What are you doing in science?
And if it gives more or less a decision for two seconds, which is the person one.
(Laughter) I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my decision to make decisions, it's an experiment that was done with this rich journal.
Doctors of the journalist had three lessons of this nature: a digital translator of 50 residents.
A representative of the company, the USA, has a nature that is a digital, printed as well as the city halls.
The result of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how you are 25.
What I like many experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
Well, a digital sample, 50 workers, and we need to compose the bicycles too.
Right from 15,000 dollars: printed evolution.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in the other?
And this left me very unpleasant.
That's what I wanted more to dance and use this decision, and I started studying about it.
It's called Tikcoin, it's a song that is placed in an equation for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making technology, and I learned a lot about this in my theory called "economy."
It has a funny way, it's interesting, you can see.
But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the option T, you already know the same to see the option.
This is the middle of her, it seems to be better, so that I'll always pay institutions, in our business, if I can have two for the same time.
This is impressive because I started to question the king of all this, and a talk that, by the way, gave me a comparison.
From these behaviors, I answered before today: "I think everyone looks like an environmental cord."
Because I have a return.
Finally, it's genetic chain, you have to be happy.
You're going to give me the standards in the eye.
But we see that it involves different forms because it involves two influences.
There's another improvement that I was fascinated by all I saw.
And this one, the hope to remove the chair from above are equal to low chairs.
And that's what my life will be going to do here, and I'll give you an appointment that I'm at all costs.
But I'll show you what it is to do.
Without affecting our heads and so we see that they are really good.
In fact, in the same way what has returned to influencing the stage we see things, what also returns to the city is the majority of all decisions: work and technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an education through safety, and we were worried about the difficult figure, it's a lot of option, and life will not be explored.
You can choose two adoptions, these three or these two, and you won't be able to figure out that we were working, but they said, "There are 500 and 11 choices."
And the team I was working was, at the same time, gathering this advice with the concept of the magazine of iconos, if the person was in the gold, she would write these three options, if the person was in the microchemanic, and she would see these three options, I would end up thinking.
They make the drawing of the architecture of decisions where I'm making my decisions.
And this caught my attention.
In the world of technology, there's even the name for this profession, called YO Ex, and the Researchers or the experience of the eyes, which are exactly the people who are the architects of decisions, work with the architecture of the decision, designing all formed and environments all the decisions.
(Video) Ricardo Chiaretti: So, why did I look like my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this guy from RAL, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior environmental economy for the digital world, and he's super fascinated that he's going to talk to you, and produces privilege, and he's a lot of my grandfather to see us, and he's also behaves with metal?
(Applause)
If any of the people who have a smartphone are something like this, they think we don't need a lot of research to know that we use a lot of cell phone, or outside the bathroom, look at it, but they get a research from the company that says, "Let's do it for 22 hours, by bed."
And he said, "Of course, open, and you're thinking about it, and there's another one."
AC: So, from these 35 million decisions we made, how many of you think are digital decisions?
These residents show this region that I'm using and digital economy, or that I also invite you to sometimes look at these none of us.
Because I started to ask myself all this.
Is it that when I come to this horizon and eat a person, I take this decision like me?
Is all of us going to change the path we're going to talk about, and we put the "wes," the story of the friend, "Where will we take, what will this genius be and what doesn't change this bullying?"
(Laughter) (Laughter) In this case, it's a wall that in Austria - it's 91% - (Laughter) and in this case, it's a number of attitudes and logo.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, what in Austria you're already a adoption?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word that's called defeat.
This word is what you're already.
Without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain d'Ascimento," you need to go out.
(Laughter) Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there and go for it.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days.
And here I have two options: one to receive the recipes, and the other to receive the offer, the recipes were dismartened to the open and was killed.
Someone decided I wanted to offer because I didn't want to go there and go out.
(Laughter) I asked to get out of the offer's mark and recycle markets.
Uber has a new functionality, a Q, you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the cube.
This is the "no" I asked him to leave if I was really in the people and until then.
I had to read to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take the work they love to talk.
Then I found this again and told a story.
And a lady?
I chose a culprit.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
She looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage here?"
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose the cup."
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, Marcelan, choosing, didn't even know, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, this is very interesting, that we imagine who these decisions are.
If we're in Google today to research today as a doctor, there are 567,000 results.
What is it that we click?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and the same was Google?
After that, what I do: I'll read the click on the website.
I love PVC, I see from there what parents don't go to the right page.
I'm just to ask this.
These little English and English have a name in the Constamental Economy as well as the name: they are the so-called "innights."
It's not exactly an English empurring, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy in the person next to you.
Don't think it's a plate... (Laughter) It's an ecology, it's an excellent one: there's a theory of a author called "Britteira," he has a book called "Donante."
"Yes."
The concept of "digitaland" is what I gave to a simple way of understanding these bodies in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
Think about the adults.
(Laughter) And in this talk, I'd like to take a picture, and I'd like to see ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Alstra and Detina Marca.
Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
In this e-mail that a text written, "Aus inscribes, TEDx de uma pessoa," you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life, (Laughter) "Awispica, me."
If you don't want to give up, it's enough to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people called Lin, (Laughter) more than 400 people inscribed?
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of the life of 13 people who stayed on the link, (Laughter) No, this was an experiment, and it's one of the things I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave.
And I show the results.
Genome is people who ask your fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Necessities.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger and this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do what someone buys, it's something they don't need, so you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use.
To make a patient with diabetes come out at the time, it's even more harmful.
Or can you use it?
To avoid truck accidents like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the petition.
From the brain waves, we have to detect a fuel.
To edit a accident.
So, these 35,000 decisions?
I know there's a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016.
People in the world have 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine that was this?
Doctors from Pokémon Poucos.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of increased reality, virtual reality, learning machine.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
How do these encouragements work?
How do these nails work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware for us to make better decisions.
Thank you.
