As it's the vestuary of people with disabilities.
If there's any difference.
Or should I have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
That's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
There's interest in fashion.
And then?
People want me in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations.
From the vestuary to wheelchair women.
From then on, I talked to several women, including a paraplete.
They were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their own life.
What about necessities?
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers.
Would they take them to the sewage to make some advertisements?
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
And outside that they lost a lot of time.
I lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
Do you do this work and these conversations?
It's the conclusion I arrived.
It's that this vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist?
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
What was the adapted clothes I did?
It was for Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
What did I do for her?
A cause with high-pitched, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort, made a super discreet zip, to be able to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no retreat to not form expensive, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and obviously I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfortunate with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena, a blouse that was opening in the shoulders with pressure button, to facilitate, at the time, to pass the head.
Hello.
For people?
They are quadriplegics, the ideal.
Is it thinking about a vestuary?
And facilitate who will dress the person.
"Parplegic!"
What about it?
Where do you dress alone?
AC: In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
I made a website.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user on the challenge day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label in braille.
People could have access to some basic information, such as size and color of the piece.
That's it.
Do you have an analysis?
And for women?
With ananism or low temperature, the ideal.
We thought about pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore.
The child's nation of the store.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Stop disorders.
The most likely and technological materials.
I didn't know.
It was in Brazil that we had the first competition in an inclusive way.
Who's already there?
This is an edition.
I left.
I did a dress.
This is Giuliana.
And I took this second place.
What about me?
Silvana.
Drika!
And many other people.
There are many other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their schools.
But it was out there.
What are the great companies, famous and conceived brands?
They realized the real need of this vestuary and they are already launching inclusive collections.
Because as an American atom that was already in the second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And the Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
All of us.
And we must think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at others.
The world?
It's changing.
They are more conscious.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking only about it.
It's an inclusive way because I need to call attention to this topic.
But what about the future?
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Why will we be?
All equals.
Our differences.
Thank you very much.
married with a name.
I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Getting.
Sophie.
They are very proud.
Also family, and very grateful, those women.
How did they help?
To make this dream come true.
Thank you.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
That's it.
It puts the life of the Enrice.
Imagine all the most guys you're already in it.
Like we don't feel this.
It's like a method that loses a suffering.
We chose two options.
I don't know how to fly, cry.
What does it solve?
Audience: No.
Fé, strong.
And continuing looking for a medule to dare.
Thank you very much.
For them, I managed to make a transplant of the doctor, which is what he needs.
Excured.
That's it.
It was very incredible because all the mothers.
And all the friends, "Wow!
They did a whole very big movement, sharing the company, social networks, everywhere.
Keeping people, drinking blood, finginginging meat.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think.
It's so big through this disease.
It brought us a message.
It's very important for everyone.
The first for us and then.
It was horrible.
The first message.
That's it.
And when?
A child of leukemia.
The risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns.
Impossible.
Besides, you don't get up.
It's really important.
And we didn't learn to settle down.
And it was spread for our friends, for more schools.
For society, people in Facebook.
I'm talking about truth, it doesn't matter what problem I had.
It doesn't matter anymore.
The most important thing is life, fight for life and for love.
The second message he happened to this disease.
So public, all that movement of...
They came out of two.
(Audience) Yes.
What are people?
They saw us as a family.
Homoosexual, I don't.
It's not a family that's called, that harvests, it's the same as all these families.
GB: In the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men.
Or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be in the family?
Or a father, seen?
Or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is that I love the family, that union, that gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that the other thing happened to us.
With this disease, for the world?
And what?
And my blood, my medule, anxiety.
We can manufacture it.
Our favour.
Sangui Sossédoa.
I'm a human being to donate for another human.
So he raised that awareness as big.
We have this ability.
(Laughter)
The blood so that it doesn't need.
For someone who has a house, I don't know.
The blood is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating Medula Ocea, driving as a dozen medule, to the chance of compatibility.
Between one to two.
And a patient.
It's about 6,000 people.
So, if you...
You can save life, it's as if you earn mega-sen.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get a bit of the stars.
It was a very beautiful moment of power.
I was waiting for them to move.
OK, I can save it in my life, yes, but folks.
without any pain.
I'm donating a part of me.
To save Christmas and that's what happens.
More beautiful, and what is the message?
Great!
It happens to us all.
So I thank you all.
Thank you.
Or support us for that union that we are not feeling, that support in conditioning.
I don't know how to save life as big.
In other words, for having that awareness that we can't all do blood and hurt to save lives and be super.
Thank you.
She slept less.
That's it.
I'm going to tell you.
Be it like you.
This is the exhaustion.

"Broken seats."
(Audience) OK, there's a slam.
Because of terrorist groups.

Hi!
Millions of Syrian.
They gave me everything.
And I was dead.

Very sad.

And our life will love you.
Stop.

11 years old.
Like this, today.
I have a Brazilian daughter.
Strange.
(Audience) Novimet.

(Laughter) I did a party to celebrate.
My son's birthday.
And everyone talks.
Very well.
The food that my wife did.
Let's talk.
I approached it.
What is the kitchen?
Very good.
To make food?
It's to sell.
Yeah!
I said, "OK, I believe."
Bajina Noffez?
Jummy, Syria, that's why it was now.
Do you have a channel?
"Well, what's your name?"
I do it with me.
It's delivered.
It's boring.
We are happy in Brazil.
"Oh, thank you."
Wow, Brazil!
AC: You.
It's true.
When in the world?
I was closed.
Well, no.
Because, on the other hand, the war is ...
That's it.
Hello.
That's it.
That's it.
I had an wrong idea.
It's about Ossirio.
That's it.
Today in the morning.
Or a journalist talks to me.
"Thank you."
What happened?
France?
Now, I don't want to talk.
That's it.
Or contact.
A human being.
Let's think!
I'd like blood.

(Audience) The Islamic State.
Orgines like this.
All hours.
What's happening is the image of Islam.
A religion.
That's it.
Or something else?
I'm not a book.
Sagrado says that kills a person.
Without it she had killed another one.
I've dared corruption in the land and how all men were killed.
Yes, from life.
It was like saying, "Life ...
To all men.
Alcurain.

You use it.
A silencing at home, OK?

"My desire."
But I've already seen some humans doing this.
All of this.
Kebeijam is the hug.
(Video) Be Jamson, so Slam has these rules.
What else?
It goes from each person wanting.
I bought.
Oh no!
The debt is fine.
"Broíbe," some things to be.
The same way you have to be treated that they don't obey you.
And it's not that good.

When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?
Oh, it's PCSO.
More of humans.

And that never happened to me.
"Why?"
Why? Because we don't know

And very important for us.
What else?
That's it.
To not get to know Mozla.
AC: Then.
That agency is explained.
People always understand.
And that's it.
Or "Teacher, Mohammed Days."
Because we must respect.
All religions.
Because all people have the same value.
That we must have truth with everyone.

To be poor people are Muslims.
CR: Great state.
Today I have it.
And the convete or you.
To give up.
It's about O islam.

It's a religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
And that's it.
I don't know.
Mine.
That one.
That's it.
Together, boat.
That's it.
In the small stories of life.
I've come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of the Center Santos, I'm prepared to take a bathroom, I always wait for the reach, who always believes, I don't believe, soon because of hope.
But in the daily lap, I know who suffers: the scholarship makes food, my salary ends, just like this race.
Studies, girls, what they told me.
And I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I had a lot.
Cozinheiros?
Fascinera.
Why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you put me so much to pay a secret course?
But who enters the office?
Opa, sorry, I had an event between five.
To clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation.
"Deo" is to be a domestic, if it were for the option, I have several friends who are already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas.
Please, it gave me an opportunity, and the lunch told me, "You follow this corridor, go straight, go to the left."
They enter that little corner that the vastor is suspicious, it's welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the Pagina's success, the page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 and this year still didn't complete four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at home.
Differences.
Last day by day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a domestic employee.
And since I use Facebook as a newspaper, I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Hey, Lina, you can't do good, that's tomorrow, it's my new newspaper."
And then I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
Then I warned the guys, "Miss, some stories, I'll start.
It's to bet on Facebook and use the hashtag and the domestic employee.
For this case, other people have gone through this too, compatible, and then they can keep following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santo.
This in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from...
My own food I did, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at home and not the bathroom.
In her house.
What was the domestic bathroom?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this was a person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compatted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last stories, and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I gave interviews to several media.
So much the international media, the national media, London babies, television and Germany, and many others.
What I was super surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
Everyone!
All of them moved a lot when I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose each other, and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the most valued domestics earn.
For hours, for hours, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces.
It's a job announcement that I called "abusive announces," for example, an announcement I read.
CF: It was for workers.
And to work as a second.
The assessment.
From 8 am.
At 18.
winning 380 Brazilian reais.
For day, a week, much less.
Please.
380 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestic, going through these conditions still today, there are domestics that are being prevented from feeding themselves, and they don't earn value to food, there are domestic ones.
Not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities.
That I've always mentioned in the page, but for these seven years, there were several oppressions stories, but in the only house I found something I call humanized treatment, which is Regina.
And soon when I got home, I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a single library that had a gigantic library, and I always liked reading, but, even today, it took a lot of expensive, and my mother, domestic, my father, my partner, didn't have the conditions to buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started to fly.
This became a daily practice, so what I did was arrive at her house, gathered everything rapidly, left half an hour to clean, to the TV.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting, deliciating myself with those books, and for my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, and knowing about the experiences I had already gone through last year.
I was very nervous, and she sat there and said, "What are you doing, I said, sorry?"
I started to get out of here.
(Laughter) And I was very nervous and she said, "Wow, you have to be interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a story teacher, since I was little, I read many books, I want to understand the story of the world."
She started to indicate several texts in 2009 when I entered the university.
I got to read at the university too, so this is what I call humanized treatment.
In 2009 it was very difficult.
Let's help the university.
With the gangs, because I entered the university, everything was solved, no, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarized some texts.
I prefer to enter the room to make proof that it's very difficult to concilate a totally heavy job with the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues, and to show that slavery still didn't end.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but there was, in this world, a woman called Lao delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, at the age of 60s, created the first syndrome of domestics, and it was known by the media of the time as the land of the patterns.
All of this when I comment and show some stories.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Why do I believe it?
That only through discomfort, we can change some things.
Nobody will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
Audience: Yes.
And why?
The great majority of workers.
Domenics in Brazil: 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And that is it.
It can't be the only condition of the previous woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one, yes.
Fifty and three percent of the population is also black, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was a Sunday.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic.
When I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I stayed without understanding, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I also work in Brazil.
I would also pass.
Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with a good picture and a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum.
Without strength.
Then they called me, at least, a interview.
I took a suspicious, and this after a graduation, OK?
I took a dirt to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so, "Are you?"
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
And I always say what was the big house in the past?
They are the illusion apartments.
What they were like.
Domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us.
They are domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She arrived.
I was running, and I was nervous.
What I was waiting for a long time for her to get there.
Friday of payment, I hear her entering the car, the baruline of the key.
Opening the door.
"Wow, my pattern came."
And when did I get there?
I was already with the clothes away.
When she pays me, then she arrives and says.
In Mina, it was so bad.
"Wow, forgotten to take your money on Monday to Tipago."
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
My girl, I created it from this little girl.
Zelo and affection, her mother would always work, didn't have much time for her.
But all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there.
I only wanted to see.
And she, marrying, was this, but unfortunately they didn't invite me for marriage.
But, as I'm aldacious.
I put my best role.
I went to the church and stayed there.
"Daddy!"
And I put my girl marrying.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's almost the case of employee.
Tao.
I'm seeing my four-year-old family, everybody happy.
And I hit a sadness.
That's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because the sixth moves.
It's almost the employee.
And the moment of my life is when my pattern will work.
It's going to work, it takes air.
His wife to work.
Tell him who's going to work, but he returns.
And the house?
For me, I was arrested.
And the only solution I had was to get rid of.
Coppies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean what?
I get traveled.
"I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck."
And that's how I can flee from his seeds.
That's it.
I say I'm going to change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, resist!"
It's winning 186 to put.
"I'll win this value in another place."
I'm here to resist.
I also left my children in Dortheast.
And they need these geniuses.
Because the modern senzala ...
What's the dream of employee?
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot to save.
Because my little pot is my opinion.
There's the "Stave".
I was in the service area.
Open your chest.
My little guy from Soviet.
That's it.
And my pattern saw me a lot.
Wow!
She started to cry and said, "Why?
What's happening with the little pot of sovereign and the toilet?
Can your bathroom use it?
Because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought little potatoes.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the little box of the employee.
Today I'm here.
Contrary to the stations.
For some people in my place, it would be in the end.
Because when I told my pattern, I wanted to study.
Do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be."
It's not true.
What are they?
His grandfather wasn't domestic?
Only the mother wasn't domestic, she's already predicted for her family.
So you have to be.
Being here, I'm here in the statistics.
Women?
That's it.
Gorda!
I'm sorry.
Different.
Women are precious, fat.
Professor, peripheric and rugby.
On the side!
How are you doing here today?
Unfortunately, there are 6 million domestic illnesses.
"What should be here on my side?"
And that at some point they'll be there.
What do I do?
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now.
And many aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch this figure.
Great!
That's what I want to provoke at this moment.
That's it.
Everyone!
Let's go back.
There are some atroas and some domestic ones.
And if each one gives this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships?
We will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones.
They work and study.
And here, still, this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, "Why do babies have to be dressed as white?"
It's uniform, yes, to be able.
(Laughter)
And she's inside her house, don't she know she's a nanny?
But no, it's to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country.
So I'm here on the contrary.
AC: I'm not alone.
That's it!
"Oh, that's it!
I'm here today to talk.
Absolutely.
Silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
For the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
You connect your cell phone.
Not a photographer.
Until I was scared.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain doesn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
I don't know.
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I was.
It started.
It turns out loud.
Abre is stage.
Take your eyes.
Is it insecure, support?
Put the inflammation points.
The first past of the dress.
Wow!
And, at the time, the pain went to the next level.
And I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this.
From this chaos?
From this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of present.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
In this feeling, in this moment of presence, which is the moment you are not.
The consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you.
You're you.
Potentially.
You don't have color, you're wrong.
You don't have credits, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was very pleasant.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know who lived a lot of me.
[A.DE.]
They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then the discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
That's it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you.
It's only sweet.
Several of you.
Think.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I really want to challenge each one of you.
Take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
"My daring."
AC: All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You sleigh, come this step.
Don't get rid of you, it's unleasant.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then?
AC: You go after, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close them.
And you, who were anoting our notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything.
I'd close, you're not connected.
You took close to you, the tool.
Internal collection.
Who connects themselves is the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the Earth.
Look back.
Look at me.
(Audience) Look.
To the stage.
And then?
Look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at it in this way."
I said, "You're fine, get even a kiss."
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Do you see where you are?
Did you see?
What did you see?
Audience: Yes.
Did you see?
(Sigh) Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, stop your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Put your legs on the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that is born.
It's fear.
"Are you afraid?"
Anyway, it's not this guy in front of you, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
I said, "Look at this key!"
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember this year.
From the approximate dimensions to the room.
Remember that you're in the building, in the south of Brazil.
And in Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
The human brain, we're connecting.
Space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you have it.
That you don't have it.
Forty sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
KP: In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Really, of you.
It was scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were a child?
Do you take your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand, touching Chica.
You felt the temperature and took fingers to the Chicara's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a legal vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
That's it.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupying area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What brings the area you take.
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange.
And it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new, equality?
It's new, it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside, to explore silence.
It's realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence?
And a state of presence that decorates from him and that can become.
A habit in our lives.
These are technologies.
self-knowledge, which are there.
In the planet.
Together with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them.
Are they available?
They're simple.
But these are technologies.
A last generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDx.
I don't think it's passionate.
For a TEDx talk.
What had the first video?
Usually, it's now the first life.
I don't know.
I can say that it's an absurd evaluation in Brazil.
The walls are so seductive.
What is the idea of translations?
I'm from a demand of a legion of the famous TEDx.
What did they understand to bring society?
I'm still sharing it.
(Video) With your friends, your colleagues.
Whether not.
In the case of Brazil.
A translation work.
But it's fundamental.
A time it's the leg.
Five percent of people according to their behavior.
Five percent, at least, have influence in English.
How does it happen?
The translator thought.
And do you decide?
To have a door, this dancing spirit.
For millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's translated into 16 and young people.
And almost always 6,000 translations made at the moment.
But we're only translated.
It's also transcending.
The talks made in events.
Audience: Yes.
The work of transition is very important, not only to take our ideas.
That's it.
But I compare to allow people with hearing impairment.
And they managed to accompany.
The content.
It's spreading.
When the talk wasn't given in English?
And I said, "My case here is a Portuguese."
The first one is transcribed.
(Laughter)
To later be lost at the same time and, in the same time, it's that it's translated to make more beautiful.
Because, initially?
The TEDx itself, "Love the Quenty."
The good news is subjects like "technology" in TED, "incertainment," which is the "e" we can translate as "diversion."
(Audience) What do you think?
Paulo was referred to it.
Naturally.
The talks.
They add an inferiority of subjects that come from an accident or the political, business, entrepreneurship, even literature.
We have, for example, talks like this.
The hunger, the smell works.
Another of my passions.
Let's stop what's going on.
The theme is excellent.
Audience: Yes.
"What? What?"
In the curriculum we have, we don't only have for our biggest life expectancy.
Like also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do of my hearing partner ...
It's true.
What do you think?
And to realize how crazy it is.
(Audience) Talents.
A man is full of fingers.
And it can be.
And to be "tox," TEDx talks, TEDx.
The TV series are educational videos, short.
And I said, "Yes, what do you want to do?"
A very small one.
And I do this.
Not only that.
Because translating is a passion, and the country is a key word in my life.
(Laughter) Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be a trox, to be black.
And not only because I learn a lot with them.
And here I see a translator.
It's a privileged reader.
(Laughter) Not only that helps me deal with my anxiety, but a very anxious person, not only wants to be the day I translate, but half an hour and hours a day, two or three hours, this happens to me in behavior.
But not only because I had fantastic people.
I'm getting to know here to receive.
The person is stretched.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth it.
(Laughter) I used my excellence as a lie.
In these arts, like this.
"That's it."
The psychologist, "Eddy!"
I said, "Thank you, I'm a man.
Wow!
The talk?
This is empowerment.
Because I don't have everything at home.
Raise your hand.
"That's stupid, what's it?"
It's a person.
Even the chemistry.
With a few criminals, two excluded to our society.
They can be inserted.
In a dignified way in our lives.
And when it's weight, I work to fight.
(Laughter) I think it's a donation work.
Whether it's easy.
I don't know about Arthur.
"Are you going to play an object?"
Just like that.
Let's go back.
Because I always choose my own.
These are mine!
I have to do it.
It's also two ways.
I understood and committed.
(Laughter)
The time that the sun ...
It's different from donating.
Men.
Restusual.
They are complex activities.
And it doesn't only matter to know.
I didn't move away.
The fundamental question was, mainly.
"Wow!
And it's already a picture.
What a young man!
It's a perfect translation.
There's always.
A dream of knowledge instead.
What is it?
Audience: Good evening.
(Video) Narrator: A lot of dreams.
DJ.
And on the other hand, a translation without it?
To be good, to be great, to be good?
There's always a degree that I've tasted.
What a frustrated conflict?
A lot better.
Because it does, it can always do better.
Why do I have it?
It can be improved.
It's almost unfortunate.
And here I need to remember.
What is the great majority of our volunteers?
It's not professional, and this is very important to decide.
Most of them.
That's it!
Think about it.
We create the quality of our dreams.
I'm not only in respect to the speaker, but without respect to anyone.
What did this talk guarantee?
(Laughter)
translations and transcessions.
As a revision made by the troops, I'm going to fight.
It seems finally.
They were approved by language.
Or a coordinator of a country?
Or, as we call, it's not from "yes".
In the case of...
They had the Brazilian Portuguese who added to Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese because it was very different.
And we have it.
Audience: Yes!
"ENCES, the parents would like it."
Returning is in kilometers.
I read stories.
We have six months.
We're Maricena.
Claudia.
Why me?
MA: We have the sun.
Bye, bye.
What are they?
That's it.
I liked it.
The owner?
Little by little.
What's the guy doing?
That's it.
That's it!
Audience: Obsession.
Because I have education.
MA: Isn't it necessary?
(Audience) I'm a kid.
AC: Not only.
What about Brazil?
Audience: What a living in the air?
(Laughter) A deep, political crisis, denied education.
The second bread.
But without it, with my own personal story.
My father.
That today it would be two years if it was possible.
Narrator: Malchine Oceo, Pemar?
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well.
And his dream was to always study beyond what I was studying.
And to make good children.
That's why the one who lived in our little translator of our girls called Tairobeiras.
He decided to change his four children at the time that I pay a lot of slides, the biggest city we saw.
In some sides, my father filled with his beginning, his logic, his fingers, and his site.
(Laughter) Knowledge also, as a commercial, he had a small hotel of a presence store.
Isn't it?
It's in 1964.
It was a great reception for Brazil.
I due to this reception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and lost.
"Oh, I think it's OK."
Wow!
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in your homes.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his failure with the name of my father decided.
And then deceive payments.
If changing for Belo Horizons as a cold behind, eating well the obstacles.
I have one of my horizons.
My mother, who today has 90 years old, doesn't help me.
Besides being an asphere in the Parado Games, still today.
It was not to know how to communicate.
Focusion of training, my life.
And she decided to do tickets to come.
So, for many years, in my house.
(Laughter) Ponte queijo was to enter the world, win a stage, go to these passages in the biggest Pai de queijo in Perdano.
So?
Audience: Yes!
Despite not having to eat many times, they don't have to dress.
Once, my father didn't open my hand.
It's that we're destroying.
To study.
And that's it.
That's it.
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the national research for samples and homicides.
In the '48 years' phase, Brazil has been 60 years.
Only 32% of people have greater personality than me.
Audience: Orange.
Who is it?
Or that fascination, this passion that my father had for education?
What did you think?
I don't know.
My father, for example, had Alávitus in Italy.
Audience: Great.
When I was seven years old,
At that time, we would take the college entrance exam.
When they put them in mind, they catch their own zone, they choose a bubble, the bank needs to make them feel in jail.
You can have a magic, right?
(Laughter) I'm an entrance.
I was shaking in the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the word.
But for my father, she would get hurt.
I don't know.
And I was living a little in this talk.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than that today, we managed to give our own.
MMS: The smaller conditions of what we have, and here I say, for me, the greatest passion in my life, of my greatest audience, are my beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
I've never put this on my chair to have a newspaper for me.
(Laughter) But for whom I asked all the mothers.
What about the stories of the tubes?
And this adventure was always a pleasure for me.
And of course, the blind people.
Coincident who coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is to be sick.
At some point in physics.
And one of the brothers is the educator without anything.
It's not true.
And I thought.
GB: Indeas, secondary ones.
Because he applies, in the education of the students, his own school.
(Audience) Yes!
The only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, our self-esteem.
Men seated in their education.
Despite the limited conditions, despite the discovery of our country.
Education has to be a priority inside the non-section.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
It has to do exactly.
In the fact that TED, just like my father, it was such a simple management, inspired us, just like today, it was inspired by these people.
It seems strange, wonderful.
I said, "Um TEDx.
I don't breathe.
And to spread the idea.
What makes us believe?
Let's think.
I'm here.
Our aunt, the voice, it's blind.
And it was with her that she had her first contact with Braille, an alphabet where I can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So he taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super complicated, ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when I returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing the letters from dots in my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule.
Because it's a little girl who allows me to write in Braille.
AC: On the roof, you write that you show the release.
And I ended up in my notebook.
I agree.
I say music, no, but I flee, but...
I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to her that I was learning, and I still gave tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Cross School," and we thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what taught us.
And we decided it's a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet and be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But saw there was no Internet.
We have to decide what our own is.
We started to research, learn about robotics, programming, our teachers, and try to set up the clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors.
The pines would show the hours and minutes in braille to be able to feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake up and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything and started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock.
And we showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
And they encouraged us to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
And use them to change this world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help in the kitchen inclusion and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't yet been created.
And if we, two students from high school, who didn't even end?
The high school is the second year, and we are teenagers.
We managed to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done.
(Applause)
Let's do my question.
What do you think?
There are adults.
In a free way, consent.
They can have sexual relationships.
Look at other adult people.
We can't.
OK, we're all in agreement.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
AC: Or in sexual work.
It's a profile expression.
The only difference, the main difference.
Now, with sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a motor exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
There's another part with an objective.
It must obtain pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men.
Audience: And women.
To manage your business in an autonomous way, publish your announces.
They receive their clients.
It's also important.
In August.
AC: Hi, there are people.
The street.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
And that's what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve it.
Children.
Or adults that are correct.
I think it's around 16 years old.
There are adults who don't feel their consent.
They are cases of beliefs.
These are cases that must be followed.
This criminal is judicially.
I said, "Yes."
That's how I find it.
It must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual emertion.
And even in the case of the prostitute of...
The institution of adults, which is forced, which is coaged, also think it's a criminal case.
The volunteer institution and the frustration of blood.
We're also not going to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
According to the depth of prostitution.
On the contrary, sexual exploration.
But taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
The investigations have shown.
Who's in Portugal?
The phenomenon of the trail.
Sexual explosion is few necessary.
In fact, they are phenomenon.
That's what they identify us, but that they can cross.
And to have a notion.
What I've just told you is that the phenomenon is not necessary.
I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic, which is the state organism.
What's in Portugal gathers information about relationship issues with traffic.
And that there are relatively two thousand accesses, which are the last available data.
It indicates that they were Portugal confirmed 118 victims of traffic.
Human.
What do you do for likely exploration?
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's just three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify an action.
Judicial.
What doesn't justify is that it creates a whole speech and a half.
What are the results of reality?
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are there.
That's it.
Like victims.
I'm very happy.
It's structured.
There's something that expects someone.
I wanted salvae.
And this doesn't correspond to reality.
Or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider Vitti.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we knew.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings such as gender inequality.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities.
There are social and cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity.
Uncontragement.
That influenced the decision's decision.
But when do we talk?
When we interview, when I find it.
Investigator, interview.
I talk, I'm with people who do sex work.
What they say is that it will be an option.
In other words, a pondrated option.
After I mentioned the advantages.
It's disadvantage.
What is entering an activity that is profitable.
I think it's high too.
I witness a disabled and it's not recognized.
What if I ask you?
What do you think about is the image you see immediately?
Sure.
It's when you think of a person who prostitute.
Think.
Okay?
I bet most of you thought of two situations.
In other words, or in any previous one.
Or in a woman?
It's a sort of bad aspect.
It's about mini-scale.
It's in a corner, in a dark street.
"And the city?"
which is very likely toxicate the loss.
I'm sure.
There's someone exploring.
But is this just that?
They are just two stereotypes.
They are simplified images.
That they don't reflect with rigor.
It's reality.
There's a diversity.
Thank you very much.
There are people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Deparatics?
One of the experiences.
Not all people have positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences.
And of lifestyles.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped with us, we thought about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made of fuel.
And the identity.
And try to stimulate the number.
People who eat sex tell us what?
Plete Saint-Drop.
Let's introduce it.
We're good, we're close to weight.
I don't know.
The total of people deposit themselves.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
That's it!
It's just minority.
But it's not my intelligence.
Let's give the studies data.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the person to day.
I'm in Lisboa's couch.
And that interviewed 140 sec workers, both in the context of the street, as in context.
Between men, women, trans people.
And in all over the country.
And they found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
Don't forget if it's a percentage of men who are.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here.
I'm going to study the last month.
I said, "What?"
BP: Although it may appear.
"Yeah...
An idea.
It's apparently humanist.
When it's analyzed, deep down, you realize that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And what is the idea of criminalization of the weather?
Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex.
That's it, but I wanted to buy myself.
The idea is based on it.
From this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims.
His iniciation.
And, therefore, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects after Sweden.
And the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But it has been very strong evidences.
I'm namely the organizations of new phenomena that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they tell me that this law puts in greater rivers.
There are the own dry flavors who put rich people to know how to drive.
And that increases its vulnerability.
The violence.
The stigma.
And the disease.
Another idea we have is that all people.
That this idea of all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Hmm...
It's an idea.
I know that, without big explanation, people's resources happen.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until investigations have shown that relationships between us.
I'm a researcher.
I don't know.
What about your clients?
They are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is dehumane.
They are the people.
Because they are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through gender professionals.
"I know I'm going to take it."
It's a right hand.
People who have disability.
They have the right to their security.
It's your pleasure.
And many of them can do it.
running from the professional.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is someone who receives train.
To know how to have sexual relationships.
There are people with disabled people.
I think this is saying.
This is quite clear about the social relevance of this job.
It's about sexual work relevance.
And now, what's left at any moment?
What's in favor?
It's one of the customer criminalization.
That's it.
In other words, if it's people.
You can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think so.
It's the best option, at that moment your life, to make it easy.
To your people.
There are these economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
He found the work conditions.
I don't know if this can be done.
This more exploration than in the workplace, why do we continue?
To condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work.
Why is stigmatism so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral.
And specifically moral?
Sexual.
What divides sexuality in two?
On the one hand, he had a sexuality and considered.
Digitimate.
It's normal.
It's natural.
And on the other hand, we have a security and it's considered illegitimate.
It's normal.
I felt natural and that's when it started in the sky.
The fact that the mask is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural is based on stigmatization.
It's the social rejection, the description of the sanction, the devalorization of people who do this activity.
"Thank you!"
This is a brand with a spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes.
The stigma is a form of violence.
It's in the base of so much discrimination about blind people.
I don't know how to say it.
When they drive in situations in the area of action.
Because of justice and social security are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The defense that we can drive a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" followed by women in two.
The wrong and the misunderstandings.
Seriously and not serious, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's human.
It's a instrument.
What's up to the brain?
This is the control of feminine sexuality, it's a kind of lady's sword.
This is above the head of any of us.
What a woman?
They had sexual behavior.
Life, norms, children, are socially restricted.
Correct!
The freedom of being stigmatized by puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
Let's go!
Why do I think we can do any of us?
(Laughter) so that it doesn't continue.
It's about respecting blind explorers.
And wow!
What the path is the human rights.
And all types of people who do sexual work.
It's the path of construction of basic policies based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built.
From ideological assumptions.
There's a boat.
Let's go back to the sheet.
It's like a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against funding.
It's to challenge the stigma that I'm here doing in this moment.
I'd give you a voice.
To hear sex workers.
Dar voice to a group.
Think about it.
Audience: Oh!
More attempt.
All of them are seen in attempt to silencing throughout the time.
The secret employees.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70.
But possibly because of stigma, your voice doesn't have creativity.
Now, they're heard.
In other words, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights.
That's what I think we have to follow.
After all this.
And to finish.
I think it's useful.
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize.
And to criminalize the employees.
Thank you.
Hello.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cured, art, healing being a doctor.
She's surrounded by a fundamental stone.
Thank you very much.
"Are you afraid?"
That's the relationship.
It's very about him.
Where am I from here?
It's involving me, spiritually, in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion.
What do you have there?
But at the same time, I have to have such a high school degree that allows me to have a technical rigor.
There's a technical judgment and for me to play.
The best treatment for that day.
This balance is a lot of it.
I said, "That's it.
It's the most rare official.
I'm in balance, OK?
In the last 10.
They have more areas.
Five times.
I don't know if you are.
So I followed many media.
They were also there.
Different to see.
When did we get there?
It's not like that.
The arrogance I lost.
And I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian.
It's an Indianist.
That's it.
Because I wouldn't have it since time.
I'm a rational woman.
Someone who needed to know how to do it.
What can we offer to that person?
That involvement, this attention.
There you go.
It's cool, huh?
All the doctors who go with us and go from there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo what we bring to another daily practice.
The simplification that runs there.
What can you do?
And that's replicated.
It's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
It was the path I could cover.
That's good.
Here, at the beginning of medicine college.
If you make a list of objective toys all over the world?
The first goals are.
It's altruated.
He's having good.
And these same students.
With the same research, the yes of the medical growth.
Just the succession.
It's knowledge, cure.
Some time we made mistakes.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant, poet.
And we delivered someone in TEDx.
I knew a lot of scenes, but I didn't know anything about people.
I didn't understand.
I said, "No, that's the father."
That's it.
This was to make a trip.
Let's do it."
It ends up something.
And why?
What do you do?
There's no father in medicine because he's the first time.
He got a goal.
That's how I teach.
It's reproduced.
And to give you a way.
(Audience) Yes.
The involvement of these people had a store.
A bad one.
It's a member of the populations.
Today.
It was done in the USA for 50 years.
I'm in a door.
Are you ready?
That's it.
I just talked about the benefit of the diseases.
It's editing all the bad volunteer and corruption.
Especially the seduction of women, men, children and brain.
And it became.
Let's start.
That's it.
They're out of it.
And that you can't see, that's it.
Let's look at this silence.
Like a religious secret.
And if I respect this judgment and didn't hear it there.
It would be a dignity of reputation between men and all times.
And I brought it to the violin.
Who can tell me that?
That's it.
I said, "Yes."
That's what I've been dealing with this, and still today we do the surgery.
We do judgment of things that we transgridate.
Why does it have to bring?
Because the best patient's relationship is essential for the mouth.
What do you think?
JP: Today.
Few things are registered by João's judgment.
And in this case, there's a wave.
So, what's registered for a judgment?
Knowledge, right?
There's no church.
Where?
What did science do?
Wow, I couldn't go further.
What can I do?
This method that provided in a way that an individual is no longer capable.
I'd absorb all the things.
So, today, the patient has a brand.
A medical team, because it takes care of it.
With a class and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
"Yes."
We're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this.
And it's going to lose.
That's it.
That's it.
The current theory that says "usami" can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once, I was in a class, in college, in a class.
"Why?"
"Teacher."
Audience: Yes.
And why?
I said, "Yes."
Scientists have tomography, resonance, and that's how we copy ultrason.
If I look for your hand in the belly, it's not in case of consciousness.
The guy dressed.
So, let's call one thing.
Let's see the network.
Raise your hand.
That's it.
And he showed that he had.
Most of them, right?
And 12, you can go.
"That's it."
Audience: No.
You're lying in the patient and I'll have a moment of intimacy inside.
You can remember something.
If all this didn't convince me?
Besides, I saw.
You're seeing the patient.
"You're here to answer you."
I'm not talking about you.
At that moment?
We have an opportunity to speak verbally for that.
It's taken care of it.
You're mixing the black because you want to do the good, you're asking him, "Well, they're for him."
Let me take care of you.
This is the magic.
She's not just beautiful to say "yes" but she's replicated in science.
Children, ICU, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the chest, they are appealed, better and faster, they have a higher level of prejudice.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, a house where we don't know why it appears.
There's no exam operation, no Einstein's interaction, there's no Haluty, there's nothing, the diseases have a symptom.
And what happens is that it happens because it's our society.
Some of you have already told me, "It's fascinating."
It's very interesting to talk about the relationship.
Audience: Yes.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk about a medical group.
Because, in the end, the act of relationship is not merely.
It's time for us to stop.
We need to think that there are two hours.
There are the doctors against the two.
It's time for us to stop and think like this.
"Yes."
And it's patient, patient.
And we have to take our hands, that was in our curve process, and it's not just looking for health.
But also by developing your curious process in the decisions of the process.
How do you do it?
The first one?
The most important thing is information.
And where we're talking about Dr. Google, fashion, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were many copies this size in my health house.
There was a book, a book of health, and this existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, for you to know someone, publish something, because it's a editor, you have to have content to say, "Today, Google, you have a very good information lesson, very important."
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
First.
In this way, I'm usually assigned.
And I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1 or 3% of people inside my curriculum, but knowing who I am, this gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I did, what I studied, and it allows me for anything, this doesn't matter bad, what this puts me.
Anyway, there are other people who are defending personal interests, big money, selling medicine or other things like this.
Thank you.
The city.
The second very important thing.
She didn't believe in basic things to be dealators, "Look, medicine has changed, now her problems have finished seriously.
Differently a lab with a scientist will have an immediate discovery without that society doesn't mature this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know,
Third.
If we have a paranoid color, OK?
(Audience): Yes.
But the industry doesn't have the interest you're going to say.
You're low, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly some other with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
Take the information, discuss your goal.
And that's it.
Information in the same knowledge, information and information, knowledge and knowledge.
Take the information, take part in your cure.
Second thing, it's very important to be active and national.
In such a process of cure.
To ask, there is.
Knowing.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know who you receive that medicine.
If there's a right to know which risk of that surgery, there's no right to say, "Oh, it's a public hospital."
"Man, I don't have time to understand me, I work on life.
I don't know.
But I don't think this will change today, but I don't have the culture to change.
It's pure!
That's it.
To demand isn't to get there.
I said, "That's it."
Let's go!
Specifically, OK?
It's composed with time.
What do you do?
Because the alternatives are different.
What do you want?
And that's it.
What do you want?
Now, they want to have it.
Let's see.
I don't have a chance, I don't have it, I want to have it, it's very harmful.
And we had a patient there, that had cancer.
A moon.
Audience: Yes.
There was no neurologist, so we found it.
That's it.
It's about treating.
After all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany.
That's it.
They were still, they didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor obviously didn't speak Germany.
There was a translator, the son, the neighbour who spoke a lot about the Portuguese, as he was very good.
And he was likely scared.
What did I do?
What examples did they have?
For me.
It would be a scene of a movie.
I said, "Wow, that's it."
I don't know if.
It doesn't matter.
AC: I'm wanting to say.
It's that, at that moment, magic happened.
What a definition?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture.
I gave the soul to that other individual, I had all the interests to take care of it.
This is magic.
Because it's the curious art.
Thank you very much.
At that moment?
There's a lot of thought, there's a doctor, there's it.
A little embrulatory.
That's it.
That's it.
I'm doing it.
I'm giving you a good moon.
What's going on?
What about us, right?
We can try it.
The more unity of our treatment.
It's more guilty.
(Audience) Yes.
Try to be active in your cure process.
Because this isn't doing because of a connection between the world and you'll be more well treated.
It started with the world here: 35 years old.
What are you doing in this video?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being takes, why?
We need more or less a decision every two seconds.
There are people.
Due.
They didn't take the decision.
I'd like to try to think about it.
I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of these decisions.
It changed my evolution of taking lessons.
The experiment was done with this journalist.
Cities of the journalist had three innovations in this nature.
It's a digital nature with 59 dolls.
A nature of printed magazine serves a cycle of oil.
Because it's a city where I want to digital and business.
Through this victory.
The respect of this experiment.
It's the big majority of people.
I chose the goal.
CF: Researchers.
Because I really like these experiments.
Excuse me a little crazy things.
For a second group.
It was only two options.
GB: A digital option, 58 workers.
GG: And the evolution of how 22 institutors too.
And very interesting is that for this group of people, most of this, I looked at a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to ask you, "What's the notion of the middle of series and 15 models of printed election?"
No one chooses.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in love?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
With what I wanted more advanced, I would make this decision.
And I started studying about this.
We'll be very happy, and I'll publish this person in three names.
She said, "Hi."
As you don't want to go back, it's not an action.
To influence the issue of a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in the theory called Economics and Computer.
It's the theory that exists in cognitive psychology, and this is the app called decision-making.
I created a little interesting form, you can see.
I had just been one or two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the option T.
You've already seen the same way.
If you look at her finger and say, "You're going to be better, why am I going to pay 100 to 25 dollars?"
AC: I'm not an entrepreneur.
AC: If I like to have two, right?
This is impressive because I started to question myself why that's all.
And a talk, including hotel, made me understand this.
Well, we're going to give you a little palace.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
This is where everyone appears in the countryside.
Narrator: The Civil Azudoras appears a little bigger than the south of the Nuthern.
Why? Why?
Because I have a return.
At the age of the genetic age, I had to be able to go.
We're going to give birth to our stomach.
But we see that it involves a different way because it involves two influences.
There's another improvement that I was fascinated by being able to hear.
What is this one?
It seems that we need the cradle on top.
They are equal to low chess pieces.
It's the same life that you're going to do enough.
The problem of communication is all this.
But I'll show you what it is.
That's where you live.
This is the dream of taking the bottom.
We see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, it was my best intention.
And it makes some senses and says that we have a return to enthusiasm.
In the same way the volunteer evolves, the door we see, the two.
What also involves is the evolution of all decisions.
I work in technology.
And I didn't know where I was working in a project.
To create an application through inequality.
There were some of those who wanted to be happy.
It's a lot of option and life will not be available.
You can say, "Are you two options?"
It's strange, it's this one.
And it's not true, I'm sure.
Because we were working, but they said 500 km of possibility of choice.
And here's where I was working, I was good, I put it in a way.
And without believing that school was a teacher.
This way was defined by another profession.
Maybe in your stomach.
I'd say these three.
I don't know.
If you can see me, I want to see these three options.
It was, at the same time, fighting for the concept of the colony magazine.
The event is that there are people.
They do the drawing of the architecture of decisions, today I've been working for research.
And this caught my attention.
And in the world of technology, there's even a name for this profession, called YOET.
And the Research is the experience of the eyes.
(Video) Ricardo Chiaretti: Good afternoon.
They are the architects of decisions, they work with the architecture of the decision, delegating all formed and environments in the whole area.
Why did I look like a friend of mine?
Today he found a day to visit him.
His idea was him, he was the person who was a guru in this behavior area, and he looked at me and said, "Look, what's the one who's not proud of?"
And I told him, "These people, you have to bring knowledge to the behavior environmental economy to the digital world, and he said, "I'm super fascinated, I want to start with you, I produce privilege."
And let's talk to Denial Helen.
I really wanted to change my way of seeing it.
Good afternoon.
It's there that we don't need much research to know that we use cell phones.
Everyone lives in the third larvae, the scholarship, the eye to him, but they get to a research in the present that was competitive.
Do you know there are some people who have a smartphone?
They stay with this smartphone for 22 hours.
Uber.
It's necessary for you to be with your advice when you have a mood.
It's through these 35 million decisions we make.
How many of you think these digital decisions are?
Doctors talk about this regitory of Rosa and digital comets, or that they allow us to study these numbers in the world.
I started to ask myself about this.
Is it that good or this horizon as a person?
What was this drawing like this?
Is it that we're going to change?
And we say, "Let's do it."
The six story of my friend will tell me, "Do you want me to know this city?"
AC: How do we make decisions in which we treat and dealing with power?
It's for the world to decide how to speak.
That's it.
(Applause)
What are these challenges?
Speaking of drugs, I'm going to talk to you about another interesting problem.
It's the wall in Austria, it's from the 21st century, and in the diagram it's the one with you.
You may have wondered what the journalist thought was and said, "It's the number of books."
Isn't it?
It's a number of two men.
When I got to know this number, I asked myself, "Why does Alta have 90?
It's all the pain of the region.
(English) Okay, Austria, you're already a doctor.
You need to ask to leave.
We were in Aarc.
You don't need to ask for a prize.
That's it, go!
What is called defeat?
This word is what you already have.
Not to do anything.
Do you know these eggs?
You need to capture birth, you need to get out.
If you already have your desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone and driving.
And here I have two options: Let's take the recipes.
And another one to receive me.
Two blind people were dismantling.
Sorry.
So someone decided I wanted to go to Africa.
Yes, there.
What to get out of the offer's mark and the recipe's mark.
Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people.
I opened it.
I was there already marked, but I got it.
I said, "No, I couldn't go out, if I was."
I thought it's cool to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber mountains, I don't know if you know.
I said, "That's it.
And then, another one of Uber once told me a story.
Here's a lady.
Let's choose.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked strange.
I'm like this, there's another façage, OK?
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose it.
Audience: Yes.
P: It's beautiful.
I chose the job without even knowing.
She chose what she was already chosen for her.
Isn't it?
This is very interesting that we imagine who we are doing this.
AC: If we go to Google today, we need eight and a half of people.
There are 5.67,000 results.
What is a click agent?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country.
Would we choose a place where people eat?
After that...
What do I do: I'll go and click in the country?"
I love Perfect, I see from there what parents don't go to the page.
Just to ask for it.
And I wanted the cube.
It's Uber giving us a little bit of things.
AC: These English and English have a name in the behavior economy as well.
They're called Gindah.
It's exactly a little push in English.
I'd even like to ask you to walk with you, the person next to you.
I don't need it.
(Audience) So, how?
Right?
So, this is the "no".
There is a theory.
Audience: Yes.
He's called "Britteira," he has a book called "Night."
Audience: Yes.
The concept of "digital," right?
It's what I gave.
It's a simple way to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me.
Now there's one.
I thought, "Where is it?
(Laughter) In this talk, I created a picture, and it was important to see.
They're thinking that only those who fall in this is European.
From Austream to Daikina.
AC: Everyone here received an email.
A: The confirmation.
(Laughter) This e-mail had a text.
I've written, "Although you're seeing, TEDx is a person, you're automatically taking power of all your decisions."
What are you going to walk in your life?
Luis Pica.
If you don't want to give up, it's enough to stay in this book.
"Daddy!"
How many people delivered?
There are more than 400 people written.
13 people stayed there.
So, this means that I consume all the decisions of life.
Three hundred seconds.
No, this is an experiment.
This is one of the things I do.
I do this experiment to understand how people behave.
And I show them.
Genome, what do you do with your child?
To have this knowledge.
I'm from these little birds.
Doctors.
This can make us manipulate, right?
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
KP: Knowledge is a tool.
If you are there, you can use to do what someone buys, it's something she doesn't need.
So you can use good.
Like, for example.
You can use it.
to make a day-to-day patient.
And the moment comes out, it's the masculine life.
Or can you say?
AC: To avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the medition.
From the brain waves to detect a kitchen to edit an accident.
