(Applause)
Have you ever thought about how people's residence is?
If there's any difference?
My role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, people with and without disability, today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to play clothes?
Does someone's help or be here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about this.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took it to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made the fall of the piece lose.
And, outside, they lost a lot of time and lost money, and many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I made a pants for her, a pants with high-pitched costs, made a super discreet zip to be able to exchange the probe, which is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of the piece's spirit.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button, to facilitate the time to go through our heads.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegic, ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person and for paraplegics, who give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for Pate, I made a rehearsal.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, under the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that would use in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
The ideal is to think of pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that women don't need to find the ideal role, the childishment or the lowest status.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very gratifying.
This means that in Brazil there are more than 45 million people with some disability.
More than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels, ready and stamped.
The most likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
And I took the second place.
What about me?
Silvana ...
The "drika."
And many other people ...
Several other stylists ...
Small brands are already adapting pieces in their schools.
But it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who were already launching their second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first, and the target was also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
For all of us to think about this, we must have empathy.
Look at others.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
[A.DE.]
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause) My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
I started working with trash, and I was designing people, as a child of four years old, until adolescence, and I was going through an adult.
Putting your teeth, knowing how to separate the other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was winning the parents' awareness.
The parents were delivering me to the children.
People recognize me in the community?
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate.
But today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community, we have a seed harvest when we go to the forest.
I'm going to work with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
There, I met a plant called her name of Engar, she's a luminous plant.
And we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers fast or soil.
And all the quantum plants.
Below, we have a good result, and our community ... (Laughter)
"When did I go to the arm?"
There, I knew that all plants ...
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth, right?
So, you have to imitate the forest, because there in the arm.
I had a lot of prag that was giving more plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
That's it.
So I tried to plant them, various: there I have the guilt, graviolous, Andyroba, Copaiba, Maru, Guaraná.
And everything, there, doesn't give money, (English) "Light to eat?"
There, everything is natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
"Mom, brave."
And besides, without comparison to ours, in our communities, we work there, everything with organism.
You eat everything natural, don't have toxins in our communities, OK?
(Laughter)
To compare the human being as an animal.
The child compared it and said, "You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children."
The Pope Gai came to this tension, then he talks to the animal quote, so I compare the child like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection, the greatest care for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge, and it was putting everything into this: "My father says this, the first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us."
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person who observed my house.
I was observing my house and ... (Laughter)
I saw that my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad." (Laughter)
So, I saw that all of this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's OK.
And today, we have ...
A work inside costs the gift of the human being.
"The skyloning of the other hand?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, for those who don't know what's far from the human being, it's the Amazon tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river that, before, had a dam in front of us, just a little of our community.
And ...
This hooligan cried and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're getting there.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
I went through this person.
Nowadays, when I say...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
We breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ... (Laughter)
Is it always talking to people educating children?
And ...
I'm going through other people, and I have the message to leave a very small phrase that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come to us and get closer to us.
Are we talking and competing people?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Hi, guys, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) Thank you very much (Applause) Thank you very much.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the largest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
(Laughter) And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers here as we feel, as a fear of losing our child.
We said, and we were not two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find it.
The first message made us think that, through this disease, we transmitted a very incredible message, it was a very beautiful movement, and all this movement made us think, because all the most of the school and all the larger people, divulging the press, social networks, brought us a very important message for all of us, first for us, and then for all the rest of the rest of the world.
It was that when a child has leukemia and has a risk of life, all or rest of problems, of fears, of concerns don't matter.
The second message that happened with this disease, the public, and all this movement of thinking about pain, was that people saw us as a family that didn't really matter, and that we learned to be established, and it spreads more, or more important to life, fight for life, and for love.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or an important father of a mother to have a family, or a father of a mother, this is the union, this is what gives life, this is what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that transcribe happened to us with this disease, to the world: "What?"
My blood, my medulated anxiety, we can manufacture them, I'm a human being to donate for another human, so he raised this awareness, and he knows, it's not just our manufacture.
For someone who has cancer in the blood, if you need to be parts, when you have an accident, at any moment, all things are needed, and donate medula osse, if each strike as a medulator, the desire to compatibility.
So, if you go to all of us, so I thank you all, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, I was a very beautiful moment to be able to save my life without a thousand people, I'm donating a part of me, so you can save life."
Or supporting us for that union that we are not feeling, that support conditioned, not only to save the lives of Tancrède, but to have that awareness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you (Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
She slept in Laikon.
Basically, that's it.
The base is like you.
This is deafness.
Does that?
My name is Talola del Chinau, "Su Syrian was born in Damasco, Syria capital."
I studied in Damasco's university, today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a bit...
(Laughter) That's why, in French, Portuguese.
I'm sorry, without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brochancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that don't have anything to do as Slam.
A war chest.
The beer was beautiful, calm, cheap, and easy to live, the population was 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child.
Two apartments, and I loved to know the world, a writer of engineering, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15, 2011, and then all the other cities of the country came.
My mask city was the saferest of Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day, after five years of war, or my country is destroyed.
People who didn't know were forced to carry out their family wives, summarize and didn't come back, my last years in the series were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it was going back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian have been killed or have been influenced in other countries.
I, in my family, were very sad when we had to leave Syria, my father and my brother, and I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country again.
It's about that Brazil had opened the doors for Syrian, so I went to Bahirutz, after ten months to protect my family, and wish São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil.
Why did they have more opportunities?
And you saw Pinas, or a week, to knock back.
I was 40 years old in my life.
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, in Brazil, Brase Leirinha, Sara, nine months, and everyone talked very well, today I have a family, and I enjoyed it was a very good kitchen.
And making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook Bachina on Facebook, "Hey, Syria, that's why now everything has a pen and paper," (Laughter) I'm there as a Syrian. (Applause)
I do food and deliver to Tibor WhatsApp (Laughter) (Laughter)
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says to me, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk, or contact with a human person.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the so-called French so-called "Brazilian men" or "alkron," not only sacred book, which kills a person who is allowed to kill in the name of religion, but exactly the state of Islamic is a torrent organization.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there is no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like the differences of religion culture.
When you use your wine, a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covers the hair, like my wife, and my wife ask questions like, "Why do you use this lion at home too?"
In Javier, there are other rules today.
Men and women can't touch me, embrace, embrace, exhausted me from the wedding, but I've already seen the humans who do all this.
They see only those rules, but each person wants to buy, or not, they also drink some things, the same way they have crossed, that they don't obey everything, they don't plant well, they haven't allowed to eat boat and drink alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or be a sex with more than a partner?"
This never happened to me, (Laughter) Why are those saved things of the slam?
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after the agency exhibits, people always understand and respect, the "Mohama Des," that we all have the same value we have to have "Bedade" with everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or indigenous people of all our money for the poorest people, it doesn't matter if poor are human beings crossed today, and I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows the best Islam.
And your children?
Valbuder will grow, together based on the cell phone.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, my rhythms come to recite in the Sun in Santos, I'm prepared to take a bathroom, always ready to not give up the love of those who always wait for cancer.
Those who always believe in it, don't believe me, soon because of hope, but in the daily lap, I know who suffers, the label makes food, my salary ends, just like this race, studies the girl, what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I had a lot, a cook ...
"Fashineira, why not hire me in the mall?" I don't understand if it was for the option of all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the mouth told me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn the left, enter that little corner that the vastor is overwhelming, be welcome.
Well, this poetry written in 2011, the page I created at Facebook, like the newspaper, it wasn't programmed at all, so I took a few memories from when I was a maid, and I even thought, "When all the people have already achieved me, I've always been talking about four months, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, this year."
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos, this in 2009 and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I was doing.
In her house?
There was the bathroom for domestics, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and this person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last stories and not stories of today, 2016.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces, that the job I titled as abusive announces, I gave interviews to various media, both the international media and the national media, the babies of London, the TV of Germany, and several others, because the domestic work of Brazil has more than 4,000 access, more than 4,000 Brazilian reais, for example, a announcement I read.
It was for workers, to go to work for the second, to the sixth.
For day, a week, much less, a month, there are domestic and 80 Brazilian reals, this one, which is our condition here in Brazil, there are domestic ones going through these conditions, not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities.
And then, I was very excited to live so many books, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, it's very expensive, and my mother, domestic, my father, I didn't have the conditions to buy the books I always wanted, and for my surprise, the Regina enters in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, and, since I was a child, I read a lot of books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then she started to indicate several texts and said, "Wow, I've been interested in studying, and I said, "What am I doing?"
Conciliating the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and various class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, some stories, and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, right?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black woman.
Why do I say that at the TV series, my grandmother was domestic?
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I was also ready.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, then they called me at least one interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this and that, and then, "Are you really?"
Yes, or I'm magic ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say that what was the big house in the past are illusion apartments today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's the past not so far away, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala ...
It's almost the case of employee.
(Audience) Yes.
She came running, and I said, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take her money, second wooden fair," "The modern bottle arrives with the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came."
My girl, I created it since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother's family was always working, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she spent and suffered, I was there, I only wanted to see her married, just that, but, unfortunately, she didn't invite me for marriage.
Because Christmas and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take the copies of all the comforts.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, you won 1800 Brazilian reais per month, you'll never win this value in another place."
It's the little kitchen of the employee, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, I ended up arriving at a new service service service, because when I said to my place, I'd be there in the store, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that I brought the little pot.
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, your mother was also a domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Peripheric!
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, periphery and retreat ... (Applause)
I'm not here today.
Apparently, there are 6 million domestic women.
"What should I be here on my side?"
And that at some point they will be, everything I do would happen that my life is not thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that many are not watching me, but they'll be able to watch several patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one gives this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we'll decrease a little of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this domestic work is like private property, we can see in the airports, why the nanny has to be dressed in this country, so I'm here in the statistics - I'm not doing it - I'm talking to six million women and women, OK?
I'm from African Axias and not forced.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) I'm here today to talk ... (Music)
about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, first to disconnect.
Spread your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Until I was dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Who says that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally?
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself ...
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was deceived in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Go to the stage.
Open the stage.
Take your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment, sponsors of inflammation.
The first past to destroy.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book, and I was sure I wasn't against it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence ...
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not the anxious participation you have in front of you, you're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex.
You're a human being.
It's time for me to put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
It's much less.
It was a lot of anger.
It's not in the heart.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know they lived a big guy.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
Of all I had already experienced.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already experienced.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Do you remember?
Most of you?
He only stood his eye.
Several of you.
Think about it.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
Sleigh, come this space.
It's not about getting rid of you, it's delighted.
Disconnected from cell phones ...
Put your cell phones on the floor, put them on the floor ... (Laughter) Put your bags on the floor!
That's it.
And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were fighting in the notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection.
Who connects themselves is the human being?
Now...
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
For the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"No, I'm going to look at her in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss ... (Laughter)
He was connected, guys.
Let's see.
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
(Making sounds using the lid) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are you really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
It's not scared.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Do you look closed?
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university and Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, you took a hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touching Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected.
And feeling where are you?
Observe yourself.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
Open your eyes.
Strange.
I said, "No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence?
This is the account.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become...
These are self-knowledge technologies that are in our lives.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are gytechnologies.
A lot more generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity, silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
(Laughter) (Applause)

Who has never been passionate about a TED talk that has had the first video, (Laughter) that, normally, it's the first view, as it was my case, I can say that it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
Audience: Yes!
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of a legion of childhood and TEDx.
That they asked for the passengers in a shared way with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In the case of Brazil, the work of translation is fundamental, once only 5% of people according to public transportation of the Sun.
Five percent, at least, have English influence.
As a rapper, the translator thought he could have a poor in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
10% of them are Brazilians.
It was translated to 116 languages.
And almost always 6,000 translations made until the moment.
But we're only translated as we also transcribe the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transition is important, not only to take our TEDx around the world.
But, as to allow people with hearing impairment, they can follow the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, my case was very Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be fertilized for me instead and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially, TED, with its own looptype, indicates, abandoned subjects with technology from TED, entertainment, which is the "e", we can translate as an immersion.
And I designed the pope referring to the talks now with an inferiority of subjects that go from the accident or the political, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
We have, for example.
Let's talk about the forms of science.
Another of my passions is letting what the subject is this auditory accident.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our greatest expectation of life.
Like also the reduction of the journey of human work throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do of my hearing partner ...
It's translating and receiving as a bubble of talks in the environment of ten.
And they can be the "self-prox" for these TEDx rocks, or TV series are short educational videos, accessible to very small children.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be an electrode, you'll have it.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my age, because I'm a very anxious person.
Not only wanting to do this day of contradictory, but half an hour and hours a day, two or three hours passed by, this conversation with me and with the translators.
(Laughter) Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here receiving.
Inspiring people, but why do I think my theme is precious because I think it's worth using my obvious obsession?
(End of video) In initiatives like this, that TEDx.
(Applause)
(Applause) The second philosophical is the cold.
I opened the option of man in life.
(Audience) Yes!
It gives light to this fear and become what is empowerment, that I don't have a doubt and education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I also don't have a doubt that education is fundamental for people, less privileged, with good crime, or excluded to our society.
They can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's the work of donation, whether I donate your time, whether I judge your knowledge.
Can you judge an object?
Just because your volunteer work receives my choice, a mine decision.
I have to do the best way possible and I have to commit myself.
To donate the time that embraces us is different from Guaras Sobras, the rest of our time, the production of complex activity that demands not only to know foreign technology, the deep culture, or mainly.
Our language.
And John Fomes, who is a young man of this man, behind a perfect translation, has always a well-known dream.
A lot of research, a lot of work, many research hours.
And for us, such a fluent translation to be a scholarship, there's always a degree that I've tasted.
And frustrated with the facts of what?
The best thing you do, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved almost undefinitely.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
But, despite this, we create for the quality of our translations, not only regarding the speaker, but in respect to those who are going to watch it, right?
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers, so they will finally be approved by a coordinator or a coal coordinator.
Or, as we call it "healthy".
In Brazil's case of the Brazilian Portuguese, which is Juncia Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories, "We have the Meman, we have Maricene.
Claudia, and me?
We have our guys who are crazy about my birth, liked the tone or the tone and the coffee.
(Whispering)
Audience: Yes!
(Audience) Yes.
(Applause)
Very well, this obsession I have with education, in fact, has to say, not only with Brazil, that lives a deep political crisis in which education is connected to the second bread, but without even having my own personal story.
(Video) My father, who, today, was two years old, got hurt for primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to understand very well and do the fourth and mathematics, very well, and his dream was to always be able to study further because I was studying.
And making children study, that's why the gay who lived in our neighbor's kitchen called "Iobeiras."
He decided to change his four movies at the time, I pay a lot of obstacles, the biggest city we live in.
In some slides, my father had sold his beginning, his logic of yellows, and his cycle.
Knowing that, also, as a commercial, they had a small hat from a presence store, they had invested years.
(Laughter) However, in 1964, as a great presence in Brazil, it became this reception and other reasons, with my father, it was the false, and it really lost, without anything, that I've been killing ourselves with the "Mova Ecedes."
(Audience talking) A lot felt as humiliated by his boyfriend and my father decided, after paying his debates, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold mother, playing back, eating well liked to drive.
In my horizon, my mother, who today has 90 years old, is Marjuana, besides being a vacuum in the Parado Games.
It was an excellent kitchen, a training supporters for my life, and she decided to do a ticket to sell.
So, for many years, in my house, "Poor de queijo," it was literally "canio Paulo," "Give this disguise to the best peakers in the horizon."
(Audience) Yes!
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing, my father and my mother, was that we were destroyed to study.
Audience: Yes!
And that's how it was done: a big fact without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the nation research for samples and homicides.
In the 48-year-old faix, at 60 years old in Brazil?
Only 32% of people in greater solidarity than me, fundamental.
And this obsessed, this passion, that my father came to education?
Transparentia?
In the worst days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting me.
As a result, when we were seven years old, at that time, we were going to college entrance exams.
And a group puts me and thought, "I've got a job for him and for any visit to appear without houses."
(Laughter) Then, I'm entering the words, "You can imagine."
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, they would arrive shaking without knowing, they were training a little to this talk here, anyway.
I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we managed more than that today, we managed to give our children as better dreams than the ones we had.
And here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life of my plan, many are my beloved dreams, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
The ones I've never put this as a chair, to have the newspaper for me.
But for those who I asked every night to read stories to sleep.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincident that, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the creative educator, revolutionary ideas that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
(Applause) In education, in an obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite the limited conditions, despite the discovery of our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives on the TEDx has just been inspired by the fact that TEDx, just like my father was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
That make us believe that, despite all.
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So they taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when they returned to classes, I started to be surrounded, in some classes, and I decided to go back to the braille.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up leaving my notebook, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left buying a rule, which is a little that allows me to write in Braille, where you write that shows the release.
And my agenda?
I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threw me to the use of music lyrics.
While I wrote her that I was learning, I still gave tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Coyation of Cruz."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what we taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, learning about robotics, programming, and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we ended the clock, and we showed the minutes on the Internet, and we tried to create a clock in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we spent met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from our interest could help in our aunt and potentially many other people.
And this has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
(Applause) So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, and there's still a lot to be done to help people ... (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Music)
(Applause)
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
The agudas people.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
(Applause) Put your handkerchief.
(Audience) Yes!
Okay, we're all in the court: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way, sexual relationships can have.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a monetary exchange, that is, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And the other hand, with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces, receive their clients, in apartments, or even street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about what I'm here to talk about and I'm not going to talk about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that evolve around 16 years or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
in sexual version of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer institution and forced constitution.
In other words, we're not going to talk about sexual traffic situations, but taking all the people who do prostitution, for victims of sexual explanation, is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
In other words, research has shown that, in Portugal, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact, they are phenomena that identify us, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traits.
Human.
Almost all of them for plural exploration, victims for sexual duration.
Only three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify a judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that it's all a discourse and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
"In defense."
Explored and there's something waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider that it's a victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
I also have all the people, the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of strangements that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator interacts, conversations, with the people who do sexual work, what they say is that they will be an option.
It's a pondrated option, after equating the advantages and disadvantage, which is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destined to disappointment and is not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately.
(Laughter) In mind, when they think of a person who prostitute themselves.
Think.
Okay, and I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and from Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street of the city?
And it's very likely to hit the next step and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
From practices, experiences, inside positive experiences, not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories.
They're not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women foreign, they are not just women driving, there are also many women foreign in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped, when we think about the prostitution from it.
Someone who's on the street and I tell you that the studies that are made fuel.
And the Western cities.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century.
Please stand up.
Because it will only represent 10% of us.
"The total of depositing people."
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
In other words, they are less, they are minority, but they are not negligentable.
I've already given you the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the Navidad of Lisboa and that interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of the countryside, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women, and there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
In sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, medicine.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed, deep down, because it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex.
The idea that's at the base of this law is that people who are at the present are victims without exception and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor and the client, and so we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
(Laughter) But there are very strong evidences in the midst of non-90s that are on the ground and that work every day, with people who talk about sexual abuse, and that increase their sustainability to violence.
It's the stigma and the disease.
(Audience): Yes.
Another idea we all have is that this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
These are victims ... Hmm!
It's an idea that, without big study in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea of what client has a criminality.
It's a idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between...
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of connecting clients is dehuman.
Because they are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go back to sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure, and many of them can make sex professionals run.
There are even countries that have the legal figure, which is the assistant, and I think this example is quite clear about sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroyed any argument that tries to be in favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Thank you very much.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done you."
It controls the connections of work if this can be done without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the one hand, it has a sexuality and it's considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural, and we have a sexuality and considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural, and that's when it's committed to sex.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and natural, is at the base of decrease, of decrease of people who do this activity: stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many overwhelming secrets, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area of justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way, now, I don't know if you've ever heard this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on the woman.
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
(Laughter) The stigma of puta divide women in two types, tied and tired, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta is a tool that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior disorder, normally prescribed norms, it's the risk of rejecting the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do I think we can do any of us to make so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, which has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also...
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's challenging the stigma that I'm here doing at this moment and giving voice.
Listen to sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been.
Something of the most attempt of the most seen attempt silencing throughout time, the sex computer, so for everyone, organized and used it as long as it is, they are not heard, but, precisely because of stigma, we don't want to tolerance, and that's what I think we have to follow.
Audience: Yes.
After all this ...
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect stigmatize and to criminalize sex workers.
Thank you (Applause)
(Applause) I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But I also have good news.
We can cure it.
Artic, cure art, cure being a doctor.
It was the power of a fundamental letter.
In the medium relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to get involved, spiritually, in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have there, there's empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment and for me to play.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationship of our time, with all the most superficial and rare, so the equilibrium is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
It's different to see.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
From "elite Branca," I thought I was going to take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me.
I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood.
To relate to someone who needed to know how to do and be able to offer that person that involvement, that love, this attention.
He's polar.
The ones that this convention, the request of floor, the horse, the honor.
All the doctors who go with us and focus on it.
And Rocky is.
It was the path I found here, which brings us to the daily practice, that the simplification that occurs there can be replied here too, it's the same because it's in the research of the stage that we bring to the middle of the Amazon to cover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of medicine college.
If you make a list of objective toys of students, the first goals are there.
It's altruism.
It's going to be OK.
These same students, with the same research, at the end of the multinated culture.
Just because the association of success is knowledge.
It's cured.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we took someone who had a brilliant, poetic stadium, and we handed someone in a technician who knew a lot about medicine and didn't know anything about people.
(Applause)
The concern with old and patient relationships is based on the past.
In Greece, which is the fish in medicine, where the father, the medicine that is poor, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before.
When Adão got married with the apple, the Eva desengastated, and this was going to make a loss plane, it's what we do until today, I don't touch the same thing.
So why is the address considered, instead, to define me and little to my father, to teach me why for the first time?
There's a method there.
It can be an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, retrodesized, replicated.
And in a way that the development of these people had a logic.
In that occasion too, it was developed, it was created a poca isolation.
And even today, it's used in medicine formature, in the world, it was done in a certain corner of Cristo, people in a picture.
They're words very complex, and I've prepared three words here.
In all the houses that entered, I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of the children and of the brains.
That's why they saw the respectant life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respect this judgment and not the violin, it would be a gift of interpretation between men and all the time.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today you do a journey?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
So, yes.
Today, few things are registered by a man's judgment.
And, in this case, I have a work of participating in a transition that is registered to a John's program.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a debt to produce science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this: medical knowledge proliferated in such a way that an individual is no longer capable of absorbing all knowledge.
So today, a patient has a team of doctors because he could have a class, and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this and losing the patient's height.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group class, like teachers.
And I tricked with worst processes, patients, to take graphs, resonance, and when we copy the mutation.
If I look for a barrier, you're at home of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called everything and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
He looked and had tapes on the patient's finger and noticed that he was smoking and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth and saw he showed that he had emagressed.
If you're on the loss, light and dose, you can see if it's taking care of your own clothes, the big juice can talk a lot, when you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that he can remember something that doesn't tell you about, and he said, "If all this didn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing, patients.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're trying to deal with it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "Don't verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're wearing the black because you want to do the kiss, that you're paying attention to him, leave your care.
This relationship, this magic, is not only beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, are Christmas, who are caught in the choir, are applied, improve more and more, increasing the number of functional diseases, our means, the same functions, and the house we don't know why it appears.
I don't have exam operation, I don't have external interactions, I don't have Halitis, I don't do anything, these two times are like this.
As I said, what happens if our society is a little sick?
Some of you must raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but if it's a patient's relationship, I'm a patient and be passive for those who are talking to me."
I don't want you to talk to a group of doctors because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
Audience: Yes.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two steps.
And there are the doctors against the two.
It's time for us to stop, who knows we're passive, and it's passive, and we have to take our hands if it's in our curve process.
And it's not only to look for healthy life, but also to engage your cure process in the decisions of the cure trace.
To do this, the first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where we give the Dr. Google's talk, which is fashionable, when I was a child, there were many students, there was a book from health, and that existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's an editor, you had to have content to say, "Today, with Google, you have a very good information lesson, very important, but in many very bad times."
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
In summary, today, it's usually assigned.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for anything, and that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, they have medicine or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing, didn't believe in very important things, "Look, medicine changed, now your problems have finished seriously."
Differently a lab, a scientist, will have an immediate discovery, without the scientific society doesn't kill this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody is doing anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my doctor, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid color like the industry, you don't have to want you to take this, you shake, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
The idea is the solution: discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information is not equal knowledge, information is a knowledge, it takes information, it participates actively in its cure, but it discusss the average cost.
Second very important thing to be active is born in a process of cure nation.
It's asking, demanding, knowing.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what the medicine serves.
There's a right to know the risk of that surgery: "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to understand me, I work 20 years later."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture to exist, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in the teacher, it's not this, it's slowly to know.
There is, if composing with time, we'll make the atendments be different.
The doctors want this, they don't want to have this time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in the tenderness, she was a mountain, and it was a mother.
And we had a patient there, he had a thought cancer.
It's a bit humorous.
Thank you very much.
And there wasn't any orologist, it's with us to bring them to São Paulo, to be treated here in the future of cancer.
Great.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, the doctor, who obviously didn't speak Germany, didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor was a idol.
I had a translator, I was the son who said very little, because that's how it was very bad.
He was obviously scared.
And I presented a question.
And for me, it would give us a scene of a movie.
The Indius looked for the doctor.
That's how it works.
Isn't it?
The summer was bread.
It's not easy, OK?
(Laughter) What I'm wanting to say is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual like this.
Without installing the language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interest of taking care of it.
This magic that wants the art of cure.
So I don't need to behave a lot, it happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking that there are doctors waiting for teachers, and that are at least a few in ambulants, who consume.
Doing.
One.
Listening to the moon.
It's curating, understanding.
So, we, old people.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
More guilt.
All patients.
To be active in your pure process.
And that makes me feel more connection.
And in the world there's better, and you'll be more well-being, what's difficult.
Thank you very much.
