Have you ever thought about it?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should my role as an inclusive fashion stylist?
Is it to create a vestuary?
It's a hug to everyone.
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009.
When I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
"And the vestuary?"
For wheelchairs.
Then I talked.
With different women, even with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
It's time that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist?
That was it.
To make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it.
A cause with high-cost, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I placed veil to facilitate the dress of the pieces.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface.
Obviously, I didn't put my back on my back because I didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena.
A blouse that had openings in the shoulders.
with pressure button.
To facilitate the time to go through our heads.
That's it.
For people who are quadriplegics, the ideal.
It's thinking of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics, that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a website.
I came in ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position.
To give more comfort.
She says it's visually impaired.
I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, under the top, irreversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information.
Like size and color of the piece.
That's it, there's dynamism.
For women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
We thought about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
For them, they don't need to find the ideal clothes.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news?
It's that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products.
Like colorful wheelchairs.
Are they ready and stuck?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world, which is already in the best edition.
I left the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
What are the big companies?
Famous and conceived brands that realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections.
"How does Americans take?"
He's already in his second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But what about the future?
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal.
Our differences.
Thank you.
My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
It was working with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it will be going through an adult.
In my community, do we start working with the addiction?
I was designing people, how?
collect garden, know how to separate each other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was winning parents' awareness.
The parents who were catching me the children?
People recognize me in the community.
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community?
We have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
I'm working with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
There, I met a plant called her name of Engar, it's a luminous plant.
We plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers the ground.
And all kinds of plants.
How many below it, we ...
There's a good result.
And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met.
That all plants ...
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
So, you have to imitate the forest, why?
In the arm.
I had a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them.
It's various: there I have the Cup, Graviola, Andyroba, Coppaíba.
with Moru, Guaraná.
And everything, there, doesn't give up.
There, we eat.
There, everything was natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
My mother breaks.
And the fruit on the side?
Five comparison for us.
In our community, we work there, everything with organic.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxin in our communities.
That's it!
Is it to compare the human being?
Like an animal.
The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
When you talk, it's listening, then it's going through other children.
I'm paying and I'm listening to this tension.
Then they start talking to the animal quote, so I compare the child like this.
And to deal with human beings?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
Mom is cared for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the eye, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person.
That I observed my house.
I kept observing my house and ...
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future?
It would work out.
And today we have it.
A job inside?
"She's far from the human being."
"Is the sky going to take?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, "Why don't you know what's far from the human being?"
It's the Taruga da Amazônia.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repairing Rio, what before?
I had a dam.
In front of me?
It's like this a little of our community.
And...
This dam hasn't been there.
It ended up with the river.
And today we have the "repovuando Vio."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're achieving.
Living with nature.
To understand nature.
I've always liked the forest.
Let's go to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
The forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel.
It's typical.
They breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ...
It's always talking to people educating children.
"And ...?"
What's going on with other people?
And I have the message to leave here.
A phrase that she's very little?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, do you get people?
Who comes to us?
Are we talking about it and making people?
I'm very happy.
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely, and thank you very much, guys.
I'm gay.
I got married with the name, I had two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
My family and very grateful, those women who helped us.
To make this dream come true.
What would I do?
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
That's it.
It puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most guys you're here.
It's like we don't feel this.
A fear that loses a child.
And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly or cry.
To solve, fight.
Creating, ugly, strength, and continuing looking for a hatred to flourish.
Parallel can make a transplant of the metro, which is what it needs to be cured.
And then?
It was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the more friends, our friends, made all the movement.
Very big, sharing the press, social networks, everywhere, taking people, donating blood, medulating, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
What when?
A child scares you.
I have a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns.
They matter it.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
We learned this lesson.
And it was spreading for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement found a donor.
That's it.
What about people?
They saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
(Laughter) It's not a family that's called, that's supposed to be equal to all these families.
In the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father?
Or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is that I love the family, this union, that gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that transcribed us happened.
Is this disease for the world?
And what?
Neither blood, nor medule, anxiety.
They were able to manufacture them.
Our manufacture.
The blood is blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human.
Then he stood up that awareness.
We have this ability.
Dedoar blood for those who need it, and it's not just that.
For someone who has a house, I don't know.
The blood is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all things are necessary.
To give medule to the ocean, to disaster as the owner of medule, to the chances of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one.
About 100,000 people.
So, if you...
Or to save in life, it's as if the mega seeds.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get a bit of the stars.
Ah, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to save in my life, and that's what is the message?
Or as big?
It happens to all of us, so I thank you all.
"Yes."
Well, supporting us for this union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in the law.
It's good for you.
Don't be like you.
This is deafness.
No, that's it.
My name is ...
The word is the Chinese.
I'm serious.
It was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I'm an engineer.
I studied at Damasco's university.
Today.
I'm stuck.
Not like that.
With my family.
And the mother language is Arabic.
Warabi, I'm a little crazy.
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today.
I'm going to talk about it.
What bothers me the most.
"Broken sex."
Guys, there's a slam.
Because of groups, tourists.
That they don't have it.
Nothing to do with my slam.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was about 20 times.
Three million.
Debe people.
And it keeps.
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three fingers of clothes.
A sculptor of Engineering.
Two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamasco.
I liked traveling.
And she loved it.
To know the world.
Follow.
Parabases like the United States, Spain.
It's France.
Until one day.
It started the war.
March 15.
It's 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities.
From the country.
My city in Damasco.
It was the safer one in Syria.
I had a job, a winner.
It's 25.
Pombas.
Today.
What a good thing!
And five years of war.
My country is this.
It's weird.
People, who know it, were forced to carry.
Oh, Cadaba!
From your children.
They found their wives.
Very and mutilated by a bomb.
Familiars.
I'm looking.
And they didn't vote.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it was going back home.
"When do you leave to work?"
I knew how to see my family again.
Or not.
Today.
Millions of Syrian will drink everything.
They were dead or they were fleeing in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad.
When do we have to leave Syria?
Then, noise, noise, and our life will be behind.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother.
It still lives there.
I don't know.
"You're going to come."
They, again.
To protect my family.
I went to Bara Bahirut.
Well, ten months ...
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So?
I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade.
And they wish São Paulo.
It was the best age.
To go to Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
And you, Apinas.
Or a week to blame back.
I've been living for 40 years.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was.
As much today, I have a daughter.
"Brazilian!"
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well.
The food that my wife did was to speak to Bara.
I'll tell you what the kitchen is.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created "Dagina no Facebook" or "Talada comida Syria," that's why now.
Everything has a pen and paper.
It's left, it's a number, it's true, it's true.
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened doors when the world...
I was closed.
For us.
Etress, who, on the other hand, is of attacks.
Two tourists.
Many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow here.
Or a journalist says, "Me?"
Then, what happened in France?
Now, I don't want to talk, talk.
Or contact.
Like OMAPSOI.
A human being.
Let's do it!
"I love blood."
It's allowed to kill religion's name.
But exactly ...
Oops!
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us.
Or Syrian.
Islamic State is an organization.
I'm a terrorist who's taking the image of the slam.
A religion.
It's based.
Or Alcurão.
I'm not a book.
Sagrado is that it kills a person.
While she had killed another, hosted with corruption, a Earth, and how all men killed, and that reads life, it's as if life occurred to your mother to see Polo 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslims, the Sunitar.
How am I?
My life in Brazil.
He showed me.
What can we do?
Living in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
Children of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When do you see a woman using Ri Jabi?
That silence that I covered my hair.
Anyway, my wife, my wife.
They ask questions, "How?"
Why do you use excellence?
With this heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline desirai Jabi.
Today, they lift other rules.
Men in Molière.
"I'm not going to have to play."
To embrace.
Awesome!
Except you of wedding.
Some people wish me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Keep it, it's the hug.
Beijambson, Tao islam, they have those rules, more.
Or will each person want to eat or not?
The debt is fine.
Robbia, some things to be.
The same way they have grown up that they don't obey you.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane and in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I drink alcohol.
Oh, it's PCSO.
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
"Why?"
Because these things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam later.
That agency is explained.
From her forever.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Teacher, Mohamat Dés."
We must respect.
All religions.
That all people have the same value.
Why should we have it?
Believe me.
With everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians.
Hi, Lanta Béndez.
That we have to help people who need.
All of a moment or Alsaka.
And we moved.
Two, five, four hundred.
All our money for people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystalos or Jewish.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
It was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
To end.
With "O-brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
These are your children.
Valbuder, growing.
Together, based.
What is the molecule?
In the small stories of life.
They come to recite my rhythms.
In the Sun of the Santos, I prepare myself to take a shower.
It's always willing to not give up the love of who.
I hope it always reaches.
Who always believes in cancer?
I didn't even believe it.
Right with hope.
But in the daily lap, I know who I am.
The scholarship makes food, my salary ends, and what is this race?
"I study a girl, it was what they told me."
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot of hands.
Cozinheiros?
Fascinera.
What didn't hire me in the mall?
I don't understand.
This was so much to pay a secret course.
But who enters the office?
Otherwise, I'd eat an event three.
It's cleaning everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation.
The EME is to be a domestic.
If it were for the option, it's OK.
I have many friends who are already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity.
And the lunch says to me.
You follow this corridor.
Go straight, turn the left, enter that little corner, that the vastor is suspicious, be welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011.
I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the page, "I've been a maid."
The page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 this year.
She's still not completed four months.
And how did I create this page wasn't programmed at all?
I was at home.
Differences.
Last day by day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach.
Almost in front of you.
And remember everything I achieved, there were also some memories of when I was a maid.
And how did I use Facebook?
How about the day?
I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Menina, you can do it!
It's tomorrow, it's my new day.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
Because I was a domestic employee for seven years.
Then I warned the guys, "Look, guys.
It came to me in the memory, some reports will start.
To bet this on Facebook, and use the hashtag and domestic employee, so that, in this case, other people have already gone through this too, and then they can keep following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For my surprise.
In less than 24 hours, this became very rare.
Then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first story on the Internet was to refer to my last job.
Like domestic in the city of Santos, this in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from...
It's limited to my own food.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use the code.
In her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
There was a bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on.
When I compatted.
This first story on the Internet became very rare.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
What I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories, and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails relating these stories.
I give interviews to several media.
So much the international media.
BBC long.
Ai, several years.
What was I surprised?
When I talked to these answers.
I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
Then they managed to compose each other and I started to talk.
And these stories, because domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolic.
The domestics are more valued, they earn.
For hours, for hour, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces.
It's a job announcement that I titled "How abusive announces," for example.
The announcement I read.
It was for workers.
It's to go to work for a second.
"Thank you."
From 8 am.
At 18.
Giving 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, a month.
380 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestic, going through these conditions, there are still domestic, without losing to feed themselves, and they don't win the bathroom, and they suffer from all these atrocities that I always mentioned in the page, but, during these seven years, I found something that I call "humanized treatment."
And then I was very excited to live so many books and I started to say, "This became a daily practice, so what I did was get to her house, I'd gather all the guys, and my mother, Domestic, my father, the classmate, I didn't have the conditions to buy the books I wanted, and I started to fill.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting down deliciating myself with those books, and for my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe "pálida," I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And, knowing about the experiences I had already spent in the past, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several tests and study, I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher, since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the story of the world, and then she sat there with me and said, "What am I doing?"
Counciling the university.
With the faxines, because I entered the university, everything was solved, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and many class friends who help me, I summarize some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make tests, which is very difficult to concilate, a totally heavy job.
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the traditional family of Brazil and showing that slavery hasn't yet ended.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, and the person says, "Wow, it's very heavy, today I'm here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
(Laughter) Why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this one?
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
Here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black women.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I was going to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I also work in Brazil.
I would also pass.
Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with a good picture and a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me, at least, a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this and that.
"And then, are you?"
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are illusion apartments today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today: modern senzala.
It's almost the case of employee.
She got there.
I ran away, and I was nervous because I was waiting for her a long time to get there, "You're waiting for the payment day, I listened there, entering the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern arrived, and when I get there!"
She's already with a clothes away, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, forgotten to take her money, second wood fair, it's the kitchen of the employee."
My girl, I created it since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd suffered were me, I only wanted to see her married, just that, but, unfortunately, she didn't invite me for marriage.
It's the kitchen of the employee: "I'm seeing my dress's family, everyone happy."
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
It was the modern sixth.
It's almost the case of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work, it's going to work, it leads his wife to work, it talks to the wife that is going back home, to help me get rid of all the comforts.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and that's how I can flee from his seeds.
Because when I say I'm going to change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you'll win this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I've also left my children in the northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala."
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of sorvete.
That my little kitchen is my penic, and I was there.
In the service room, woke up, I picked my little pot of sovet and sixth number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if you use the bathroom, and I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought the modern senzala?"
It's the kitchen of the employee, "Today I'm here."
I would find statistics for some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are."
Your grandmother wasn't domestic, only the mother wasn't domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics: black woman.
Gorda, rapper.
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and raft.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic illnesses.
What should I be here on my side?
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money that we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic people are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking, and decreases a little bit of inequality in this country.
What in other countries, many domestic ones, work and study, and here, still, this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why the nanny knows it's a nanny, but it's not to let it be clear, which are the places of some people in this country, so I'm here in the statistics - I'm not talking to you and I'm talking to you, millions of dolls.
Sound African roots and unforgetted.
I'm here today to talk.
about silence.
which is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, first to disconnect.
Leave your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Because I'm scared.
If you are photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Why are we emotionally emotionally?
Who are we really?
If you don't allow yourself.
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I'll do it eight, this is the conceptive energy of my eyes.
In the stage, I was very inflamed.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling very painful.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "That's it.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's follow.
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Give the pause.
Abre the stage.
It's in your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment.
Spoint the inflammation points.
The first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book.
And I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos, of this situation.
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not anxious anticipation that you have in front of you.
You're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have credits, there's no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
That's in Cuba.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know who lived a big deal.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
That's it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
To determine my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to delegate your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
Only he stood up.
Several of you.
Think about it.
"No, I need it."
Others justified their importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
Wow!
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You connect.
There's space.
Don't get rid of you, it's unleasant.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor ... (Laughter) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were fighting the notebooks close to your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed.
You are not disconnected.
You've taken close to you, the tool.
Sternal collection.
Who connects themselves is the human being.
"And now?"
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
I went to the stage.
And then, look!
For the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Look at her face."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss."
AC: He was connected, guys.
See!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
"Yes."
Listen ... (Expiration) close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Wow, the legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
It's not scary.
Anyway, it's not this guy in front of me.
Until this moment, with much more fear than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Come space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember this one.
From the approximate dimensions to the salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system.
We wake up, a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system.
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took the fingers to the Aza da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a connected vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What a black man, the area you hear.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
It's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality is new, it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
It's taking into account.
That much of what we do is to be determined.
What we've already seen.
To look inside is in silence.
To have a real freedom of choice.
Silence?
And a state of presence that decorates from it.
It can become.
A habit in our lives?
These are self-knowledge technologies.
Question.
On the planet, along with our productive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
And in the future, it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate.
Authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Symence is a source of freedom.
TEDxTI.
She had the first video.
I can say, "I'll do it."
I had a demand of a legion of "Fanse Idete."
What did they sell to bring society?
Books, colleagues, their family.
Once there are only one.
It's the influence instead.
How is it like that?
The translator thinks.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
10% of them are Brazilians.
16 and young people.
And almost always 26,000 translations around the world.
Like also transcendants.
The talks made in events like these here.
But compare to allow people with hearing impairment.
In my case here, there's all this.
The first one is transcribed.
Germaine: Germaine, Germaine?
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially.
It's like the logotipo indicates.
In topics such as "technology," "Entrortinment," which is the "e" we can translate as "diversion."
What do you think?
The people got together.
The ones who come from the event are political, businesses, entrepreneurship.
To you, literature.
There are talks that evolve the smells.
The theme is this inventive event.
It's that terrible time we have.
On the other hand, the reduction.
"Daddy, I'm going to take this video game."
It's about getting into account the goal.
In the NGO of ten.
And it can be.
They're alive, educational, short, accessible to children.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do this day and show it alone.
Not only because I had such antarctic people, I met here in this event.
But why do I think I have precious people?
I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
In these actions, how is it?
To get back to who?
That it's potentially because I don't have a doubt and education.
And also a tourist: "What do you do?"
They can insert themselves with you.
And when is the fish and the volunteer work?
Whether it's from art to knowledge?
Because I always choose a mine, a mine decision.
And try to commit myself.
Wow!
To see what the sobra is.
It's different from the same.
The tradition is a complex activity that remains not only to know.
Jama Fones, who's John Lestina.
On the other hand, it's a perfect translation.
There's always.
The only one knows the same first.
A lot of research.
Many jobs, many research hours.
For us, a simple translation to be a good girl?
And frustrated, with facts, what?
Or better than it does, it can always do it better.
Because the text can be better.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, right, the majority.
All these translations and transcessions.
Or as we call it "DC."
I want to judge Portuguese and Portugal because it's very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
Do you like this?
Audience: Yes.
I have to hear it.
What a living on the air?
A deep political crisis, right?
But without it, with my own personal story.
My father, who, today, had been two years if he was living, got a primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and do it.
And the dream of him was always power.
And do how many children could overcome.
That's why the one who lived in our little kitchen called Tairobeiras.
In some sides, my father filled with his beginning, his logic, his finger, and his site.
Knowing these people, as a commercial, Jumbi that a hotel had a presence store.
In 1964.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in your homes.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his father's name, and my father decided.
My mother, who today has a few years old, is my hearing, right?
It was a wisdom of cooking.
Sclusion of training.
She decided to do some wealth to sell.
Ponte queijo was interally internal.
Despite we don't have to eat many times, they didn't want to dress in a country.
It's that we're disturbing to study.
That's how it works.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it's already condemned to the penalty of the national research for anxieties, homicides.
Or exception, this fascination, this passion that my father came to education?
What did they seem?
And when they look at you, they catch a teacher, they choose a bubble, they go to any visit to stay at home.
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get there shaking.
Without knowing, he was having a little clue to this talk here.
It's better conditions than we've had, right?
And here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life, in my greatest opinion, are my beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
To have stories at all.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident, coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, became teachers.
At some point in life.
And one of the brothers is the educator, yes, absolutely fantastic, creative.
Interprets, revolutionary ones, what applies?
That's it.
The only message I can leave here today?
It's that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion with initiatives is TEDx.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm part of what TEDx, just like my father, was such a simple management, inspired us.
Don't inspire yourself.
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had her first contact with Braille.
A alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So he taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when I returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule.
It's a little machine that allows us to describe in braille.
In the jungle, you write that you show the release.
I ended up in my notebook.
My agenda.
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threw me to the roots.
I wrote her that I was learning, I gave tips.
And with this, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Crown School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet, we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But Vio didn't have the Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to create a clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake and nothing happened.
We wrote everything, chose everything and started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock.
And we showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy it was, that we created something to help others from what they are for us.
They encouraged us to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help people's inclusion and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the time of the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: two students from high school didn't even end, and if we, two students from high school were still created.
In high school, we're second and we're teenagers, we managed to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help people.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
(Pre-recorded voice) Can you go to the manual?
Thank you.
OK, we're all in agreement.
(Laughter) Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is the expression I chose.
The only difference, the main difference.
With sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a mountain exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part with an objective.
And it's obvious to have pleasure.
There are thousands of people I do.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients, apartments, hotels, or even street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
That's what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases who involve it.
Children.
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggressions of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer institution and forced constitution.
I'm also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations.
Attention, it's confused with prostitution.
On the contrary, sexual exploration.
In other words, taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
But the investigations have shown that falls Portugal.
The phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is little expressive: they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion.
What I've just told you is that the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks 118 victims.
Human.
Almost all of them for likely exploration.
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify an judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that it's all a discourse and a half disconnected from reality.
Because there's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
Like victims.
Very ugly.
Sturated.
And there's something waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't correspond to reality.
Or is it just another stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequality.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of constraints.
That influenced the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator meeting interviews, I talk to people who do sex work.
What they say is that it's an option.
What a pondrated option, after equating the advantages and disadvantage, is to enter an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately.
Audience: Yes.
It's the mind when you think of a person who posts.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or at least in the woman of the bad aspect?
And from Ministry, in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
And it's very likely to be a psychodeparent and, of course, there are someone who explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Duratic.
Of the experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped, when we think about the prostitution.
Does anyone in the street?
I say that the studies that are made fuel.
Western cities.
They try to estimate the number of people who are in this century.
Please stand up.
What will it represent only 20% of us?
It's the total of deposited people.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
That is, they are less.
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
I'm going to give you the data of the study done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the teacher in Dias, from the University of Lisboa.
And that interviewed 140 sec workers, both in the context of the street, as in the countryside context, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2 percent men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does about the victim of a man or a teacher, forget that it's a percentage.
Men, question.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, in high school.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed, deep down, because it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the crime idea.
In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex.
But it's incredible!
To buy mistakes.
The idea is based on this law.
Whereas people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-violental organizations on the ground, that work every day, with people who talk about sexual abuse, and tell me that this law puts in greater risk.
The own drivers put rich people to know how to dry sex and that increases sustainability to violence.
To the stigma.
And the disease.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened.
The resources of people, and this idea of what they create is a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between us.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of criminalizing clients is dehumana.
These are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure, and many of them can make sex professionals run.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is: someone who receives train to know how to have sexual relationships.
With people who are disabled and I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
about sexual work relevance.
And now, what's left at any moment that tries to be in favor?
One of the customer criminalization.
So, if people?
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of their lives, so they can do their own.
There are these economic needs.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
It was found on the work conditions.
If this can be done.
It's more exploration than in our work activity, why do we continue?
To condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is, "What?"
What about moral?
And specifically moral?
Sexual, which divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, he had a security and considered.
It's legitimate.
"Normal."
It's natural.
And we have a sexy deafness considered illegitimate.
It's normal.
Anti-natural and that's where the process begins.
And the fact that the mask is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural is based on stigmatization.
A essential rejection.
The description of the sanction, the devalorization of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a brand with deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences: stigma, humanize, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many brain discriminations, for example.
And when they drive in health institutions.
From justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
In other words, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
(Laughter) The stigma of "puta" followed women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of the feminine sexual sexual sexual security control, it's a kind of smoking behavior that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior disorder, normally, it's the risk of being the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to disappoint the risk.
What did you call?
But what are we?
What do I think we can do any of us to make so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of basic policies based on scientific evidence, which has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And I was also there.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's challenging.
But I'm here doing this moment and giving voice.
Listening sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been.
There was one of the most attempt to the most distant silencing throughout time.
It's sex consumers.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70 but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have creativity.
Because they're not heard, we don't want to say, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
After all this.
To conclude.
Do you think it's useful?
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
"Thigmatize."
I wanted to criminalize sex employees.
I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cured, art, healing being a doctor.
It was the key idea of a fundamental letter.
It's a medical relationship with science.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and for me to play.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationships, for our time, are all more superficial and more reasons: "I'm this balance, it's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
It's different sometimes.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
From "elite Branca," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't wear India.
"Yes, Missis."
When I got there, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood.
There, to relate to someone who needed to know how to do, and to be able to offer that person that involvement to that love, this attention that was stuck there.
The ones who convince this, the request of indigenous, oral, or naive.
All the doctors who come back from there.
And Rocks?
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
The simplification that happens there can be replied here too.
It's the grandmother who doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
It was the path I had to cover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of medicine college.
If you make a list of objective toys, the first objectives are.
Altruism?
"You're fine."
At the end of the medical course.
With the same research?
Together, success and knowledge.
I'm sure.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we got someone who had a poetic brilliant TV.
And we delivered someone technical, who knew a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The concern?
One: the old relationship with patients, a medicine, is the payment.
In Greece, which is the fish in medicine, where the father, the medicine that is poor, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before.
When Adão, in gas with the apple, the Eva desengageed it, and this was to do a loss air, it's what we do until today it's not the same thing, (Laughter) So why does the church consider, instead of finishing, because, for the first time, he has a method?
It can be an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And, in a way, the development of these people had a logic.
In that song, it was also developed, it was created a poca's isolation.
That even today is used in medicine formatures.
That's the world.
It was done in a certain corner of Christ, I'm in a school.
You're talking about the complex media, and you're talking about three words.
In all houses that enter.
I was just talking about the benefits of the sick people.
Especially the seduction of women, men, children and brains.
Of course, what they saw is respecting the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respect this judgment and not the violin, it would be a gift of interpretation between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today, you do a newspaper?
We do judgment of things that we transgridate.
Because it has to be transcribed.
Because the best patient's relationship is essential for good care.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered by a man's judgment.
And, in this case, I've had a work of participating in a process that is registered for a joke program.
The medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this: medical knowledge proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all knowledge.
So today, a patient has a team of doctors who take care of a class, and this class is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this and losing the patient's height.
There's a current theory that says, "Sami can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class, in college, in small groups, as a teacher.
And ...
I tricked the patient's processes, the tomography, resonance, and the microscopy, the ultrason.
If I look for a barrier, I can't take care of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She used to say, "Let's call something else."
Let's see the barrier.
He looked at Nietzschett Tapá as a patient's finger and noticed he was smoking in front of us and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth, and he showed that he had emagreated.
If our smartphones are crazy, if you can see them, you're able to take care of your own clothes, a big suit, you can talk a lot, "Oh, the time you're wearing a patient, you have a moment of intimacy, you're able to remember something that doesn't take us, and you say, "If everything didn't convince us!"
Besides, as you see in the patient.
He's exposing to you, the vulnerable area, and he's telling you to deal with him.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you're taking care of him, and you're watching him, because you want to see him well, and he's taking care of you.
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to say "selfie," but it's replicated in science.
Children, ICU, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, they're similar, better and faster, they have a higher range than precocious.
More and more, it increases the number of functional diseases, our means, the same functions, but we don't know why it appears.
There's no exame operation, there's no external interactions, there's no ray of things, there's a symptom.
And this happens if it happens because our society is a little, right?
Some of you have already got up in Frasti Bobo.
It's very interesting to talk about the medical relationship.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a patient is to be passive.
Why are we talking about it to me?
What you're not going to talk about for a medical group.
After all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two there.
My doctors contract.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, passive, and we have to take our hands into our cure process.
Thank you very much.
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where everyone was talking about Dr. Google, who was fashionable, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were many students, there was a book from health, and that existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's a editor, you had to have content to say, "Today, Google, you have a very good information lesson, very important, but many, many."
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the ability to filter.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
So, the apple is usually assigned.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter my curriculum, you'll see who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for nothing, this doesn't matter, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, big money, they live in war.
The city.
The second very important thing: don't believe in good things to be evaluators, "Look, medicine has changed, now your problems have finished."
Seriously the baker.
Differently a lab with the scientist will have an immediate discovery without the scientific society.
Don't be maturing this for time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third.
If there's a paranoid thing, like this, the industry doesn't have any interest you're going to say.
There's no pump, no one dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
I want the information, discuss your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information, the same knowledge, information, information, knowledge, knowledge.
Take the information, take part in your cure, but disagree with your mother.
Secondly, it's very important to be active in a process of cure nation.
To ask, to demand, to know.
When you say that your doctor, you have the right to know who he serves, he remedies.
I had the right to know the risk of that surgery, and I shouldn't say, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I've been working for 20 years."
I know it took a long time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture of it.
To exist, to demand isn't to get there fighting with all the people, it's not that.
Slowly, to know.
It's demanding.
"Let's position time."
The method you want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to have this time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once I was in Amazonia, in the tenderness of her, she was a mountain, and she was a mother.
And we had a patient there, and there was a cancer of thinking.
Hello.
There wasn't any orologist, the disaster of the countryside is treated here.
And after other years, I had the opportunity to accompany her fruit.
The doctor, obviously, didn't speak Germany, didn't speak Portuguese.
I had a translator, I was the son, the boy who spoke very much about Portuguese, as it was very bad.
And he was likely scared.
And I presented a nickname.
The Indius put the doctor.
I don't know if you are.
Mom, that's it.
I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
What's the definition?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interests of taking care of it.
Is this magic?
Because it's the art of the cure.
So you don't need to behave very hard, it happens.
At that moment, we say, "I have a name.
The labels and the consultants.
We, old.
More unity in our treatment.
There's no excuse.
All patients.
To be active in your cure process.
I don't want to do it because there's a connection.
I want to go to the world, but it's better, and you'll be more well treated.
(Applause) Well, guys, I'd like to talk to the world: 35,000.
What are you doing in science?
And the person is one and gives more or less a decision for two seconds.
Russian, they didn't take the decision.
(Laughter) Following decisions I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my flight of making choices.
Doctors of the journal had three lessons of this nature.
A representative of the Revistant presents the Civil Center of a Digital Master also served in cities.
The result of this experiment is that the great majority of people chose how you are 25.
What I really like with these experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
Mau Sam digital, 58 workers.
And we're talking about how 22 institutors too.
Right from 15,000 dollars: printed evolution.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in another?
And this left me very unpleasant.
With what I had more advanced, I wouldn't make this decision.
I started to study a tourist.
She looked like me.
It's a museum that is placed in an equation, and I learned a lot about this in a theory that studies cognitive psychology and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
It has a funny way, it's interesting, you can see it.
But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose, option T, you already know the least to see the option.
This is the middle of her, it seems to be better, so that I'll always pay USD 15, in our business, if I can have two for the same time.
My name is Ana, he's doing a comparison.
From these behaviors, I answered before today: "I think everyone looks like an environmental cord."
Because I have a return.
We have to add a cheese chicken to be able to go.
You're going to give me the standards in the eye.
But we see that it involves a different way, because it involves two influences.
There's another improvement that I was fascinated by all I saw.
And this one, the expectations of the chess from above are equal to low chess pieces.
It's the same life that you're going to make the real problem, before you get to all this.
But I'll show you what it is to do.
Without affecting the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
I'd say, in the same way what has returned, influence the stage we see things, what also returns to Brazil is the majority of all decisions.
My dream was to be working in a project to create an education through safety, and we were worried about the difficult figure, it's a lot of option, and we're not going to explore it.
You can choose two options, the stars or these two, and it will never be safe.
And here, working on working, was a way to simplify this choice to people, this way was to have another profession, if the person was in the Greek, she would add these three options, if the person was in Mexico, and see these three options.
(Video) That's when I fought this concept from the Chronese magazine, I ended up thinking.
They make the drawing of the architecture of decisions, where I'm making my decisions.
In the world of technology, there's even the name for this profession called YO Ex, and the Researchers or the experience of the eyes are exactly the people.
They are the architects of decisions, they work with the architecture of the decision, delegating all format and environments all the decisions.
AC: So, why did I look like my friend, if today he found a day to get there, this guy is Ariel, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior economy, and he looked at me and said, "Look, I've found him who's not hurt?"
And I said to him, "These your theories, you have to bring the knowledge of the behavior to the digital world, and he's super affected that he's going to talk to you and changed my way to see him in the opposite way.
It's there that we don't need much research to know that we use cell phones.
That everyone lives in jail, taste, eggs, looks at him.
But, in fact, I had a research behind that job that would be that not some people who have a smartphone do things in a smartphone for 22 hours, nearby.
And this open curve is that you are able to get there in love.
So, from these 35 million decisions we made, how many of you think are digital decisions?
These two cities show this region that I'm using and my digital method, or that I'm going to invite you to do this in some of us.
I'll start by asking myself all this.
Is it that when I come to this horizon and eat a person, I enter the classroom of this lesion like me?
We put the "wes": the "Hey, my friend's story," "Wow, we'll have a mask," "Hey, how are we going to leave the audience?"
(Laughter) These inequality is a wall in Austria, it's 91%, and in Denmark, it's 4%.
I'm going to ask you a story that I thought was this and said, "It's the number of books, (Laughter) but it's not strange..." (Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two and two points.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young donors, what in Austria you're already a owner?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word that's called defeat.
This word is what you're already.
Without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to go out.
(Laughter) Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there and go for it.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days.
And then I had two options: one to receive the recipes and the other to receive the offer, the recipes was dismartened to the open and was killed.
Someone decided I wanted to offer because I didn't want to go there and go out.
(Laughter) I got to get out of the offer's mark and recycle markets.
Uber has a new functionality, a Q, you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the cube.
This is the "no" I asked him to leave, if I was really in the people and until then.
It's cool to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take the work they love to talk.
Then I found this again and told a story.
And a lady?
I chose a pupa.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
She looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage here?"
He looked at him and said, "I've chosen the cup.
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, Marcelan, choosing, didn't even know, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, it's very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
If we go to Google today, do we need eight and a half of people?
There are 5.67,000 results.
What is it that we click?
91% of people explain the results of the first page of Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, was I, wasn't Google?
After that, what I do: I'll go and click on the website.
I love Perfect, I see there what has the page "No, I'll go to the page seven.
I'm going to ask you.
These little English and English have a name in the Constamental Economy as well as the name, they are called "dinnatives."
It's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy with so much cell phone.
Don't think it's a plate... (Laughter) It's an ecology, folks, it's an excellent one: there's a theory.
From a car called "Britteira," he has a book called Dante.
"Yes."
The concept of "digitoland" is the name I gave to a simple way of understanding these empuries in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought there were adults.
(Laughter) And in this talk, I'd like to take a picture, and I'd like to see ... (Laughter)
You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austria and Dedinamarca.
Everyone here received an e-mail of TEDx confirmation.
In this e-mail that a text written, "Aus is introduced by a person," you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life, (Laughter) "Awispica, me."
If you don't want to be too low, you have to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were there?
(Laughter) More than 400 people are written.
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of the life of 30 people stayed here... No, these are experiments.
Secondly, I do these experiments to understand how people behave.
And I show the results.
Genome is people who ask your fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Necessities.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger and this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do what someone buys, it's something she doesn't need or you can use for good.
Like, for example.
You can use it.
To make a patient with diabetes come out at the time, it's even more harmful.
Or can you use it?
To avoid truck accidents like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the petition.
From the brain waves, we have to detect a fuel.
To edit an accident.
So, these 35,000 decisions?
I know there's a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016.
People in the world have 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine that was this?
Doctors from Pokémon Poucos.
Pokémon Go is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of increased reality, virtual reality, learning machine.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe.
How do these schools work?
How do these nails work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware for us to make better decisions.
Thank you.
