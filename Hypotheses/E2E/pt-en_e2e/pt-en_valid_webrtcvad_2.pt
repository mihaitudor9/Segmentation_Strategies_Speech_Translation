(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed.
In the way they treat their children.
But in Brazil?
We're seeing a paradox.
Our children are what we have the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children will be very bad treated for society.
In fact, this demands a reflection and demands that we can change, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
(Laughter) If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which is the majority of the writer of Mandela, we are a terrible character, because we deny basic letters such as health, housing, food, we treat them with violence.
And if they rebel themselves?
We offer her the prison, but even for privileged children, in your social position, well-carded children, children and daughters, who are here.
The thing isn't going well: we committed, maybe, not smaller crimes, and I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is starting against childhood.
And we'll get it.
The wave of Gabriela, a child from middle class.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, affection with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, this baby who will be born, and then starts to attend the hospital, and, quickly, the medical industry wants to convince me to be the best for her to be a Cesare.
Remember that, of course, there are cesáreas for each of these requirements in the private area, for example, it's harmful, dangerous, painful, and it generates a very convincing statistics that produces the culture of the Cesare, a culture that makes women believe that the normal birth must be accessed, and can be done, but certainly it won't be the same benefits in part of the normal part.
We are criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me, the same way happens with a mother's milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but already left maternity with one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, it's going to say to him, "You can take a wood, it's a little formula, in addition to her case, she has to be hungry."
She goes home more insecure, gets home, the grandmother, her mother, and you, grew up with a flag, "What a business, are you alive, are you strong?"
The child is crying, the ear is weak, in two months, this child is breastfeeding, and she loses the wonders that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms:
Experected, surprised, and the mother's milk didn't go, he's a lover, but he just comes with a lot of love, and he, infinitely, superior to any of these forms.
(Laughter) But the industries do directly with the doctor, they do a doctor, their markets, convincing their nutritional qualities, saying that they do the development of the baby.
And in this way, we're losing and patrocinating, with a lot of prizes and dinner and congresses, and integrally sponsoring the pediatric society, which ends unconsciously, being one of the biggest cases of basic siblings.
The privileges of the amydation, and they try, through the first pecado, which is the privation of the natural birth of the maternal leiting, serious health problems in children, in mothers, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovering now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother goes to finish the essence, she'll go to the church, because the grandmother can't take care of it.
It's still a job to do at home, at the end of the week, they're going to walk, and they'll spend the six, eight, ten, twelve hours in an institution, they'll get home, their parents're regretted from a stages, in bottles, and they'll live little with their daughter.
The invitation is what gives us the intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of getting to know someone deeply, and what happens if we lose with the most important people in their lives.
We're at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we're losing this, because the supermarkets spread these brilliant Brazilians, and they end up exchanging us, the Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy, for a rich food.
In Gordura, saturated fature, huge salt and sugar accesses, crocking out of the corn inside, making the weapons that industry, through food engineering, highly developed.
It's done.
For children to be completely addicted to industrialized food, and in this unable way to eat healthy food.
They can't.
Because they are annoying, this is the peculiar of the childhood that also leads serious problems, and it has an absolutely inclusive energy, it needs to run in label, for our children, it's not so healthy, because it's in a data of agrotoxes, and we're the world's consumption of agrotóxes.
Nevertheless, our urban life doesn't allow us to do this, people have fears to leave the child to leave, they stay at home, they're a wonderful thing, they're a moment of living, family members of laughing, things that stay in the memory of us in childhood, they're not crazy, and they don't forget all the world, right?
(Laughter) This is the name, Hipport, even in the moments where the child needs the awareness, and that's what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive, which we confinate our children, and prevents them from the facts of what is most important for us, the creativity and the imagination, and we are pushing it.
And then, in the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program in Brazil for the week, which is "O."
Very well, when it's going to be massacred by advertising, by consumption values, and this advertisement is a covard mobility.
The mobility that explodes its capacity to distinguish between fantasy and reality, that explore the love of it by characters, making it fall in love with toxic products, for expensive and brands, according to this love, and that instills the moralization of appearance.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, even in the consumption of alcohol consumption, we know that the beer in Brazil is not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, and, obviously, those who need friendships are deeply affected by the consumption.
Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want her to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda gets full of commitments, to relax from this stress, and they increase a class of meditation.
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing, "Who has never meditated in the balance?"
Look at the sky, look at the floor, and then it's going to be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, in the midst of action, look at the floor.
That uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance, and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects the children's directions and deforms them into a trunk, it passes to be the queen of the family, not the member of the cards, if it goes to the school, the school's fault of the school, we have eight or ten years.
She earns many presents when she needed, it would be presence.
She realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, she needs people who lead her life, this is generating anxiety and generating symptoms, we know that the importance of our children and not are fundamental ways of love, we need to give them to their children.
Doing that they don't have the experience of life, and therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration, with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver to them later, this is the peculiar.
Introonization and superproduction is a very easy one: Well, before so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, shaken, and will eat too much, or will be obese in school, doesn't pay an operative invention.
We need to do something about this, it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them on the chair.
What was the solution we're going to give to the kids to behave well, this is called "Medicalization" and "People," which, from Mafalda, talks about this, retablished in a wonderful way, about how many stories of a city polluted by a factory, people spending evil because of furniture.
They go to the doctor, the doctor sees that they are sick, they receive medicine, they go home, buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact.
Medicalization of the most popular phenomena, you see that in the United States, 15% of children today are set up a beach, with this competitive and individualistic society, what the fact that is broken is exactly the cure, right?
The three colors are the market that grows the most for depressive, we're arriving at this point, and the ritaline, the remedy, which is for the disorder of attention and interactivity?
It sold in 1999 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't an epidemic of disease, and it's a massacre against childhood, we're going back, normalizing, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, would have lost what wonderful children are in the ocean.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but it's better to change the paths, and the problems are very complex, and I don't see it without the end of fishing and factors that highlight each other.
But for the whole problem, complex of humanity, the philosopher already said, there's always a solution.
Simple, easy and invariably wrong.
It's obvious, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we think about it, a solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And in relation to time, what can we do, when we talk about pecados, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today, means "dism payment," almost all the churchs.
Digitalism is to give a part of what we have the most precious of our childhood, of our children, which are our sacred.
What do we have more precious today?
Time, our most important capital, is time.
We have 17 hours of vigilance, it's 1.7 hours we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This gives a lot of 40 per day, it's not very possible, it's only to priorize, and if it doesn't give us this week, we start with one in the week, it's possible for the time to live our children, in relation to space, I want to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a safe place where you want your children to grow because they have health and quality of life, not a good place to live.
Visualize this place.
(Applause)
(Sigh) How would he be?
Look at my eyes and tell me if you fit yourself in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure that the majority of you, yes, this shows us a little the importance of nature among us: nature is profoundly associated with health, medicine, these factors, we all know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience, and I started with the pattern behind that I wasn't delivered in my presentation, and said, "Wow, but you're talking about something incredible!"
I talked about the convergence of sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment.
Everything that makes good health, does good for rivers, does good for earth, do the animals, go to bicycle, take my body, my cities, the pollution, the collective transport, does good for the time of coexistence, the reduction.
Things always retreat themselves in a positive way, creating simple vicious, and I live with nature properly said, with open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it is to generate living between children, different children who will know each other, and learn to deal with them, hands, develop empathy, to promote the contact with the tree, and the green that produces well-being physical, well-being psychic, mental, and reduce all the problems of childhood, we're not talking about pulling the wall.
And to the city, embrace the cities, and play in the squares, occupy public spaces.
With games, with love, with affection, with coexistence, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and also not only public initiatives that facilitate us in contact with the public space with nature, that promote psychology, free events of these spaces, bathrooms in schools, gardens in the city, public transport, to take these places, safety.
Accessive and careful squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, and the word occupied practically used for citizen resistance today, means this, occupy public space with joy.
What about it?
Especially taking part in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catastrophes, as in São Paulo happened.
You're seeing here in a picture of Billings, a source of São Paulo water 30-40 years ago, and today.
Imagine the publics returned to the public interest, with their sustainability, with equity.
With transparency and payment of bills, there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's cool to participate in it.
To conclude, the same scientists, who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, and will see very early, our children will take me full, reduce inequality from the social consciousness, and from the environmental point of view, which is doing everything we already know, right?
Actuating for sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing energy pattern.
And taking the children out there, taking the kids to the square, not seeing in YouTube, and we learn to love this box, and they will defend in the future, because we only defend what we love, so, in summary, this is our proposal, children, already outside, family, and outside.
Let's take care of the public spaces with the game, with games, with fun, with participation.
The more I approached myself, the more he gets away, if it approached me a thousand steps, he's already taking part in the Italian phase that left us this year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is in the horizon, and how are we talking about utopia?
Exactly to make us walk, which makes us walk outside, (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2007, ...
I came across a big group of young people and adults.
With disability.
excluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
It was to look at the efficiency of these people who are marked by their deficiencies.
So I created the therapeutic coffee project.
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a really inclusive society?
To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school.
With parents, with their children.
And with the other side.
People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents.
For the community and for society in general.
People with disability.
Sometimes they're left aside.
Let me have friends.
It's about thinking they're not able.
To have friendships.
To feel like acting with people.
Take the case of the Igor's student, for example.
What in the other school did he study?
For four years, he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
People didn't make an effort for that too.
So, over four years, he stayed in the block.
I'm taking part in all the physical education classes.
How he loved running.
He was running all the time.
I said, "Are you getting to the clean field?"
I sought to know the Igor in a global way.
I didn't want to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school.
And what would we do together?
For him to be able.
They achieved the best learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a place.
Of despair.
Well, isn't it that it's a pull?
Today, it's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
He has many friends, he says I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on the parents' Day.
And I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
To enjoy.
It's your own learning.
Schools think.
That they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
You need to use it.
And believe it.
That they are capable.
And what about those kids inside the school?
To do good for them, it's going to do good for other students, for school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others.
Why do you choose this way?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my look.
They are living with people who can see it.
I learned to use my hearing.
I lived with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
Or those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
With those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to value my heart.
And the heart of my students.
To create connections.
And friendship laps.
And the most important thing for society?
It's learning.
It's an exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
(Audience) Yes.
I always liked eating a lot.
But I've never been to cook.
When I was little, I loved to see my grandmother.
Let's cook.
To cook, to work in the kitchen, it would take account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa.
She did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hands in front of her, in fact, was my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen.
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my diet, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
The food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine itself.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics," because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think the modernization took from many of us young people.
which is the Cuidated axis and respect for nature.
So I decided we could...
Changing the way we change.
It builds the food system through food.
And I believe...
One of the colateral effects of modernization is the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's us.
It's a little trouble.
Life ...
Rural for the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way that we can connect with nature.
(Audience) Yes!
A few years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use ...
food, food, food, as a tool, not only to improve quality of life in health terms.
But also to improve, to use as a tool.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with this, we need to change.
It's to get it.
Reestructuring the food system.
Changing the food dynamic.
The process of production, distribution and consumption of food.
So, I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example, there are two principles that lead to me.
The production of meat in industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it is.
It's produced as cheaper as it produces.
The worst is quality.
Most of the cost for the environment and for our health, in terms of speed.
The cycle of the animal is artificially accelerated the cycle of life of the animal, artificially accelerated.
He ...
He begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies lose.
It's time when it doesn't make it, and it starts to lose, to decrease dramatically.
Your quality of life.
In your health and your life time.
So ...
I believe we ...
This is very complex because, as it can cost so little, you can create an animal, and it must change this food system, I was the other day passing from the supermarket and realizing that the kilo of the fungus was cheaper than the tomato kilo.
This didn't enter my head.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables.
The process of production in industrial scale is also very...
Let's say this harmful for our lives, for our health, and for the environment.
Nowadays, Brazil is the biggest agrotoxic consumer in the world.
Each Brazilian consumes, on average, 5 kg of agro toxic per year.
It's an overwhelming amount.
And I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so.
They keep polluting.
This abuse in the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer ...
Is it because our current society?
There are inverted values, why does a person worry about the investment of values?
And not buying a perfume false because you think it's going.
There's any alergic reaction because you don't know the procedure, you don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values, and we need to teach people.
To value organic products, because when you buy a mass of alphace, for example.
It's an organic space, you're paying, not only you're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go, instead of having many times, you don't know that behind that alphace there was someone who cared with all love and took this leap to you, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why I ...
I think I fell in love with the culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think it's right?
You must know that we produce a lot of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply dispersed, thrown away.
And we still ask ourselves why it's passionate about hunger and reason.
It's a "mapolitics of distribution," we have to reveal this.
In terms of consumption?
Also ...
It's the way we...
It consumes the foods today, it's scary, my grandmother is paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
What if I took her to put her?
In the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure it's very scared.
Under those executives or those heavy people walking on the street, talking about the cell phone, swimming in a piece of pizza, for example, because also masking is something people, many people think it's losing time, but it's true.
It's very important, so it's going, anyway.
It's almost a synthesis, but because it doesn't recognize it as a way of reflection, like a synutric form of feeding itself.
And it's...
So ...
These Food Foods, these quick foods, were made in the same way, to be able to eat together with another activity, or talking about cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the classroom, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little whiskers, and so on, also have many chemical adjectives.
And an exaggerated level of "salgo Huriaçúcar," which are the three, it's the truficient, right?
And these, mainly, the savor reusers end up destroying our paladar, they degenerate our nervous system, but also mental dependency, psychological dependency, physiological dependency.
In other words, industrialized products, in excess, are very predicted, I don't even call them food, for me, they're food, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
(Applause)
And who here still makes a panel pipoca, a pack of panels in the microwaves, look?
Metade half... (Laughter) Who here still makes a cake instead of buying that cake cake, wow, also half a half, huh?
(Laughter) This question may seem an inoffensive question: don't you want to say anything, but, in fact, it means that only you exchange the panels for the microwaves, you're already causing a damage for your health.
It's consuming.
Chemistries you wouldn't put, I'm sure, absolute in your panel pipoca.
And you're also polluting with the packaging of microwaves, it's a package in this that could be less trash in the world, so I think consumption.
It's excessive to produce industrialized products, it's very predicted in itself.
So, to talk ...
To sum up this issue of the production process of food, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not healthy, it's not.
It's not working, and we must change, but how can we change?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
To cook ...
This name of art, culture, pleasure, health.
cooking brings independence, bringing self.
self-knowledge brings autonomy, safety, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry, (Laughter) because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes.
So, if you leave the industry feed you ...
It's...
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What is a pizza?
And it's about script, because not even pits, we know how to do more, right?
Ah, no, that's it.
Each rice is ugly, broken the rice of each day.
It filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are many people who don't have interest, who don't have a price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very workable, very anti-pratic, it's time loss, but, for example, if you leave the eye of the night to day, wake up in the morning.
And it's...
In 20 minutes, you have a ready party in the pressure panel, or you can simply take a day and make the feijon.
Let's be frozen by the rest of the week, more the legumes you've already cut and washed in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and, half an hour, you have the ready reflection.
This would be perhaps the same time you would take to wait the pizza to get there.
Experal of Pizza's book.
So, I believe that we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, woman.
A boy, a girl.
Children, adults, and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender.
Everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children to take the children to the fair to choose the vegetables that will have to dinner.
It's putting the children to practice a battle, "Let's go!"
Simple things in our daily lives.
We can...
These children will grow, build a better future.
A holistic view of the world will know where food comes from.
There are many people, I think they come from the Brazilian to the supermarket, so we'll...
To grow independent of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow dependent on the industry.
It's pharmaceutic because they'll be much less sick.
growing, eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to...
Changing.
Dynamics.
In food, we have to change our I.A.
Our value ...
For...
It's that we have food, we have to value the food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to give birth.
Education.
It doesn't mean!
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us to have less hospitals, this is education.
Education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food ...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing good food?
They are choices we can do.
To change the world better.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Life is not the one we lived in.
But it's the one we remember and how we remember to tell.
It's here in the background.
To talk about the transforming power of stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family are here.
I came here when I was a child, I spent vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My great-grandmother was the first tribute planter.
From the Brazilian mechanism, here in the lands of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother Tília and had seven children, among them my mother, who got married with my father.
I arrived in this world, casually, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago, it's the stories we tell that make us be who we are, and tell them, we transform ourselves, and who listen.
And it also changes.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
But are we our story before looking at this future?
We need to see.
Those who come back and honor all stories.
My passion for stories started very early, I've always liked to write, to read, to tell.
In school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me live the mourning, and I know he helped many people too.
So having told this story to me brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
That it's the power that people can feel welcomed in the other's history, feel in the colo of each one's stories.
So it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because obviously it's someone.
Go, come and sit in the school of this story and feel welcomed.
But one day, I met this whole world here, from TEDx, I met incredible people around the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products.
I understood, at 45 years old, that I needed to change, that I needed to expand.
And I spent so ...
To help people tell their stories because the world of advertising had already been very small to me.
So I started to make one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk.
Two years ago, in TEDx.
about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable nowadays.
But he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bubbles.
Because that's what he always suffered.
He wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with the subject.
Except that I do you.
While we prepared to talk about it, he always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints.
A right, especially what they had done with him.
But what's the goal to tell a story, to keep complaining who did that with us?
And otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can assume who they are, as we already said here.
With no fear.
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time he was gay openly.
He talked to a lot of property about bullying, acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful!
What about it?
I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, of the people I know who know him.
It's also to have seen that the wheelchair they imagined that Tiago had.
It wasn't anything more than a great defense.
They started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story.
Many people ...
He welcomes me in his story, "The week went by, he sent me a high saying ...
That many boys have sought him even more in the air.
At the time, it's so expensive to dialogue and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his history, that they wanted to share with them the problems that were happening in his families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And it hadn't assumed this for people in a way.
That there was no shame.
So, telling stories to me ...
These are micro-revolutions in our lives.
They're many, not only in them, but also in my own way, from everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this for seven years.
training many people to be here, in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give tips about how to start, about how to ask a question to the audience.
It counts something funny, shows the picture of your children, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a great rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has the heart color.
about this?
I told Ave's story, "Wow, it's the teacher of the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening."
And we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day?
Two weeks before I'm.
From his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this, every time you talk to me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head, how much, in fact, you have to leave everything here.
It has to be a heart.
And he changed everything.
And one day, he gave a incredible talk about listening.
about the importance of listening to others, and how was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the most when he was a kid, when he had cancer.
What did he do with?
It was to study about this.
And he taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count.
There are so many addictions of oratory and writing, but who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me and we saw this today that, how much do we hear, really?
We change ourselves.
And we are afraid to transform ourselves.
We are afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and as we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
For us?
And for others.
And listening?
Also, before that famous word "empathy," we talk so much about empathy.
But we ...
There's no minute.
To look at others, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time.
To people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So?
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
(Laughter) But, after listening to his talk, he made another TEDx.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most varied stories I heard, all the others.
When she taught me that empathy too, I learned collectivity.
"Yes."
We need to look at the problem of street residents, for example, that when we say on the street, many of us don't have anything to give.
When they ask us something?
We have "yes."
We have at least one smile.
And he doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell, that make us be who we are, and to listen to others, really.
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listen, and tell it too, it becomes... And in the middle of the preparation, a fight that was the process here for me.
I was out of my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much?"
Now, and helping people.
And the answer, for me?
And for everyone, I came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To give her the key to your lives.
From the room of the flaws, the rooms.
Values of the kitchen between uncertainty.
I wanted to free many people I know.
I gave them the faith in life.
Fé, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, to say they have the right to change the right to cry.
The right to not love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Freedom of your story, which, although important, is not determining.
Liberating fear.
I wanted many people to know.
They had at least one minute of rest.
Then they could look at the side and come back to smile, tell and hear.
What are you, what stories will you tell about your life, what stories do you want you to tell about?
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, where there are all kinds of stars and stars, they don't pull roles, they are belonging to their plural spaces, there is no flag, beautiful, rich or poor.
It's only linked to existential existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while during a very obscure phase that fell over my life, a phase that was denied to me the right to just be.
However, I don't look for acceptance, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender who was attributed to her, at the moment she was born, and the right for life.
So, because this is why I created this poem, because he does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky, the universe is infinite, along with millions and millions of stars, but none of them were able to produce something so simple, which is acceptance, empathy.
To understand definitely that the difference is aggregated.
(Audience) Yes!
It would be a very bad experience if we lived in a society where we were all equal, so that's why we have privilege and the opportunity to be different.
Different is beautiful, it's incredible when we feel with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this is rich, this exchange.
So I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself today to know something or someone different from you, allow yourself.
AC: Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
After starting my gender transition, I always asked myself about who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a capula.
It was where I could be the same, where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired the body, where I questioned God, why I was different.
Well, the bathroom turned into my best friend.
He was always there, after a replete of bullying, or when I wanted to put his in his head and dance rebeldes, because I only rewarded until today.
(Laughter) But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me?
Or better, why do I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
The fact that I was different from there, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, for lack of information?
And when it's about the trans universe, this path is even harder.
I researched on the Internet, but I didn't see people like me, I didn't know what it was like me, so, during my artsenic graduation, I had the opportunity to know myself in front of me.
Theater showed me a new world, he was a divisor of water in my life, it was in theater that I learned to deal with the difference, it was in theater that I learned to understand the other.
So I started looking for my true teenage years, and I started to unleash.
It's difficult when you enter a cashier, spend a lot of time in this world, and you still have to learn to deal with the non-acceptance of the other.
In the case of us, for example, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come, are you transmitted, our new thing, there's no traffic face?"
No, that's what you do, it's going to happen.
Folks, who are consciousness and chooses that life expectancy of 35 years?
Is there any crazy person here who wants to live like this?
While men have their life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, chooses and seeing the country that kills trans people all over the world?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this, and they question about the veracity of this.
For example, the National Association of transvestite Women said that we, transsexual women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, in 144 people who were killed here in Brazil, 2016, facing 21 deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have up to 9 times more chances of dying with the rest of curiosity and violence.
Being trans isn't an option, but in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's a wheelchair and a force, resistance, expectation for 35 years, there's no way that we could mediate the best panel, but it's not.
I could stay here in the whole afternoon explaining to you how I brought my life story, but in each of us, it's the protagonist of your own story, understand the difference to something that can definitely change the world.
I only depend on ourselves, for example, I'm the proof of this, after I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my...
My art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish about me.
I wanted to go to YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to another "J" and "perform" and "outuber," and in the abstain of my career, I was invited to live a trans character in an empressor in 150 countries.
(Cheers) (Applause) It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went from my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like "Macher, shown," "You'll never be a woman, die."
What has no price?
(Audience) Yes!
(Applause) (Cheers)
What has no price is this message of mothers, of other trans girls, degrading me.
Because by teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best: receiving message of other trans mines with brilliant eyes, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
I understood the difference of something that can definitely change the world, but I also understand that I don't want to be just strange.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm far further, but to understand this, I have a place of unknown, I really need to understand that we're many, we're plural beings, the difference aggregates, I'm far beyond that.
The sky?
It's the refugee of being isolated.
Who was me, a being next to me?
And not even if it's so blue.
Freedom without limits.
I and the sky, the yours and me.
Don't look at me, don't ask me to stop, I've already delivered my corridors.
From the past?
But they remain their scars, that mark my soul.
But the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: a side, now I'm, now I'm going to fly, I'm very brilliant.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and accompanying children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, many times I couldn't explain what cancer was, what was the treatment, the protocols, the procedures.
And they knew that I had a ovarian studio, that doctors called "Tera toma," a beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly, to take the tumors, you won't take a sixth."
(Laughter) Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate, I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point.
And it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and I didn't have it, at the same time I stayed with cancer children, I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
And that's it.
The belly is all mixed, I called the nurse and asked, "Are she talking about?"
So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's out of visiting."
And then I asked her to handle me.
until I slept.
I cut only after the room, I used cancer, metastasis, and committed gangs.
Audience: Yes.
I'd say to children, "Don't give Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites, and the only thing that ...
It was the safe information at that moment that I would die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone, if many times you can't even say the word "cluster"?
And I was a doll.
And the whistle bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were in my heads to help me.
(Laughter) That's when I realized.
This information of society to lead in hair, in fact, the surgery wasn't for me.
I learned it was for them.
I thought it wasn't the most adequate ones, that I wasn't able to see myself.
When I entered the hospital, the kids said, "Wow, you'll scratch hair to be like us," I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer."
I got from you, no, that one we don't take, can be close to me, don't get it.
But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking about various things and counting about procedures, when I went to do it.
It's to put the catéter because I did chemotherapy before, the first I took advantage of it, I received a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, there was a sabonete, a toothpaste and a teeth curve, but also a shampoo, a touch.
And a pent.
I didn't have a hair, (Laughter) and that, for me, is information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, and what happened?"
Children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we've been playing, but then you think, you'll say, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong remedy, that's why the child doesn't know, she knows the protocol, the name of chemotherapy, all this, sometimes parents try not to talk to protect them, but then the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy."
The pharmaceut tells you a strong medicine, what will it find?
But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused a hair fall, because it killed cells that quickly doubled.
But not only the cells of the tumor click quickly, as the hair cells also understood, they still said, "Oh, it's working!"
And we started to engage children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day doctors started to connect to me.
If there's a patient who's going to put a paper, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs, "Oh, but then I have a patient who's going to push a leg, you can come here, and there I go, there I have the doctors, health professionals, and our creative friends, and we decided to open a NGO."
We opened BABA because it's BABA do Cancer.
What we did, normally, those who make health information are health professionals, advertisers, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But the patient approached the end, this entrance in the patient, he's in the middle, but at the end of the health professionals, and with this we illustrated the most common terms of the ecological environment, and we illustrated all this with the support of the health professionals, we didn't need to be explained, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
Do you draw the ventricles?
(Laughter) Because no, so we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes: these terms leave our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides per year.
If there's a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we've been healing 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: hospitals started to use, they started to ask, children were from New Zealand, Japan, several places, and I'd say, "But there's Portuguese," but we have translator, and GI is very asked in Northeast, because children and parents, many times, are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and risk the pages of the procedures children are going to do with this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
And information, sometimes, is not only that thing, information technology, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotic modernity, sometimes information is a slope.
In a kit, so what do we say, and we prepare?
That if you need information in everything, for example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, children, they earn much more present and pay attention to their hair.
But sometimes the child's child has already done the treatment, he's without cancer.
Sometimes the child is overwhelmed, with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, it's taking care of the clowns, or there's something at some point.
And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if we put a careful child, sad, sad, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money, but you can look at the website.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?"
And, suddenly, I receive parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "My daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there was a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window, to see, to a father with a good life, and in that time we needed self-esteem.
You only have information that puts you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to your society.
Audience: Yes.
We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
(Applause)
In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career?
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, it's not easy because it's dependency here in a disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, if, in fact, the answer is inside us to treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought of several things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of these defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats, this organism that has its own defense mechanisms, called "factory barrier."
The mattocephalic barrier, despite appearing a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain.
What do bacteria, viruses and nocious substances don't enter the brain and don't do bad for our heads?
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they are very small molecules, and, by being very small, they have a almost balanced passage for the ematoencephalic barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain in other circuits.
We also have another very important protection system, which is our immune system.
(Laughter) Our immune system is composed by cells, anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria and viruses and substances as well as they can engage it and neutralize it.
I don't want to do it.
Or, is it here?
We couldn't gather these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are innate, which are ours.
(Applause)
A few years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day that some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs.
They produced anticopsus.
Contract your own drug.
It's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
It's enough, it's not needing drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use this immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
(Applause)
And I and my team.
A few years ago, we're researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to win again their freedom and control it.
How does this substance work? This substance is located in our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticops and anti-coffs are large molecules, and then that problem that the barrier really leaves disorders, because when the user...
It's consuming drugs, this small molecule connects itself to a big molecule and, "Wow, it's no longer going to be harmful barrier."
(Audience) Yes!
And look at this image here, how is this beautiful process?
That's it.
Here, the right to you, we have a while that didn't receive the vaccine, these white dots you see.
It's a molecule of cocaine marked with radiation, once we managed to immunize them, when these rats don't immune, receive this cocaine marked with radiation, it freely passes and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
And then you see it on your left side.
There's a very significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, which indicates that this cocaine that was passing stopped passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated radiation rats have a much bigger radiation concentration in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides that the drugs were arrested in a blood fabric.
The other very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize that they had received drugs, so they were stopped inside the box or more inhibited what doesn't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
So, what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people to gain freedom, we believe that this treatment, the therapeutic vaccine, or the anti-drogas.
It can be a treatment that will open a opportunity window to these people who have chemical dependency.
Those who know, in a while with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide.
A time to gain freedom again and...
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
Scootererapist.
It's more than 40 years.
I want to say it ...
Besides.
Danorose.
Besides?
It's a psychologist.
There's a trendy disease.
I do everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
That Janifelenu, Pierre, go.
And me?
We denominated "normal."
A normality pathology.
And I have to say that ...
And maybe these are one of the encantations?
To have this TEDx big encounter?
Thank you very much.
Is it here?
"No, the song is sitting."
Pontuated from the beginning.
What is the nurse?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some sense.
In some title.
The war?
Cool, for example.
It's an example.
Maybe that's it.
The most dead.
What is it?
It's an excitement.
How far can I understand?
There are two foundations.
The most important ones.
The nurse is the situation.
Systendic.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
Speaking or fact that not always.
The nurse existed.
Not always.
It's existed.
The norm is a typical disease.
From moments?
What do we live inside a context?
Where predominates ...
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
of predominating corruption.
Dishumanity in your word.
Egocentrism.
So, is it normal?
Does this adapt to a sick system?
It's about keeping it.
"I have been."
A worker?
For more than 30 years.
From the International University of Paz.
It's the only place.
And people think that peace is in the bubble.
What happens is the absence of conflicts, no.
"Dad is good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars?
"Let's see here, come."
A little of pauses.
To shout down the peace.
But with other weapons.
The weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
The love with the passive.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must be that ...
That they have the ability to present symptoms.
symptoms and concepts.
Sometimes even.
A conscious, lucid despair.
An indignation?
That's it.
This makes me remember ...
From a family disorder.
When is my daughter Isabela?
She was five years old, and today she's 34.
And there's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What?"
What's the princess you like the most?
"Are you bored, Cinderella?"
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought, "Wow!
And he answered, "What?
I like all May's written.
And I, too.
I'm surprised.
I respect many people who say more.
(Audience) Yes!
Sometimes...
Because it has to be the safety of feeling in its own skin.
I love contradictions.
That the "normatic" don't sit.
People who sought me.
The panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
What a captain!
There were open doors for perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it the fear of a family system?
It's a method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
Is it the fear of animals?
I feel disimated.
Of forests.
And these people woke up being desertified.
I respect a lot.
Denominated people.
Of psychotics and neuroactics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten him.
That's why, in Africa.
People who are considered crazy.
They are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a paradise that captures.
The contradictions ...
Culturals.
Systemic.
And sometimes they don't fail.
And how did I say it?
Stop!
The difference between them.
A santo and a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
He doesn't speak.
Maybe these people, at least in a big measure we call...
I don't know.
Psychotics are saints, failures.
I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consciousness, a dream.
The problem is in the atmosphere, it's the people who don't care.
It's dehumanity.
So I think, in my occasion, that I came from a seminary here.
I like it with it.
I don't think so.
The taxist, or knowing that I was a psychotherapist, told me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
It's kind.
You get up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing.
He's stupid.
It's target of bullying.
People hated, ridiculated my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand that?
"What am I trying to say?"
"I'm in lunch."
So ...
I must say that it's all the people I do.
Respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this encounter.
At that moment, "Oh!
What's suffering from a desert?
So ...
You talked about the nurse, the machismo.
Docassism?
So, what about homophobia?
From diverse?
Exclusions.
"Wow, that's great!
Could we say, "No, it's environmental?"
The nurse gives.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
(Audience) Good afternoon.
And that this auditorium takes fire and each one is looking at the minimum, it doesn't realize, its existence doesn't make sense.
We're in an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
Doing the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe?
There's a concept.
In this education that has also been here.
Pontade.
How do I feel?
A possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
From the desire that brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what brings us in a stage like this.
Because we're wrong.
A promise that I've done.
We see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
Just you can happen.
If you didn't count, she would get stuck.
So ...
In the bottom of the norm?
"Yes."
The situation.
It's a car.
It's very important.
It's the evolution, it's also been said.
Today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Din.
A bird.
From a serventy, of a monkey?
I think of a friend, "Wow!
Let's take a look.
An alternative Nobel Prize, Economics?
In developing country, MAFREDMAGS.
Shirlene?
When I met my dulce.
He used to say that since he was a boy, he wanted to know that the human being was disturbing.
From other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father ...
That mutual respected ...
Your father says, "It won't be stupid, my end."
Audience: Oh!
(Laughter) It differentiates itself, for example, the immersiality, who acced a little light, and he says that the first stupid estup has become a science that we need to study.
It's absolutely...
Denoa, I like to remember the slower.
Is it a big brother?
He used to say, "What do you need?"
"That's yours."
Is hippothalamic ideal to be a good animal of the ugly to the corte that will be good?
The question ...
It's stupid, because it reviews rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly...
It's rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Coolified.
To do as a person talking about development.
tablets with graphs.
Suffisticated?
Like a person sitting in the tree's branch and closing.
So ...
"Nice," she also said.
What for him?
I had only one.
Two infinite things.
The universe?
This human stupidity.
And he grew up: Einstein.
With relation to the universe.
I still have my doubts, (Audience) Happy!
But I need to say that I discourse.
"Diainist" and "max nephing."
And considering what?
They are pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the north museum.
Human beings...
It's not your nature.
The stupidity, on the contrary, we were born to be, to cry.
It's going to be said.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
That, in 20600 years, I'd say.
What differentiates our species of other species is inacabation, it's in complete.
We are not born humans.
We do ourselves humans.
A sign isn't born, it's broken, you've seen it, and it's going to the sea."
We don't...
Are we inacabados?
That's why saying confuse: human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
To school, to tartarugas or to...
It's so pleasant.
It seems that, since the 17th century, education is the perfection, we are not the teachers, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, just developing a rational testing, no.
It's about following.
Keeping the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist.
They say, emotional intelligence, relationship intelligence, the unionic intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concence?
To develop consciousness.
Where?
Jocus, values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
He summarized like this.
Your long existence.
At the age of 15?
I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
The 40s.
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
At 50?
I knew what the fears of the sky were.
"Are you sure?"
I listened to my elderly.
At 70?
I could follow the indications of my own heart.
Because what I wanted no longer that day, borders.
It's justice.
Is the same as the terapeutas and Alexandria?
It's been around for 2,000 years, you've changed clothes.
Leave to be a whole existence, and five minutes.
It was exchange.
It's about how it works.
And this is the task.
In this sense?
The nurse ...
It refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust it.
That the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, the opposite case, the question, will it be?
21st century.
Is it the human being?
It's not less than this against this game.
In the future.
From the new ones?
Geractions.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's not even anxious, it's in the silences, people don't realize it.
It's not easy to become a human being.
Give didn't understand human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being.
As Tia Chanta said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to be seen.
Has anyone asked for it?
Think about God.
And the IT.
I said, "Thank you."
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a monastery in the big wine.
It's fluorescent.
With human beings?
Specially.
We are.
So ...
"I want ...
Still talking ...
From a story we tell, "Don't go."
For more than 30 years, the little guy learned to know.
This story.
It was once.
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let us flow."
that would take a source, a water drop, and throw it in the fire.
And I'd go back, resiliently, another drop.
I'd play in the middle of the fire, and I'd come back with patience.
The wings ...
"Já."
That's bad.
I'd throw it in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, see, flow?"
Do you think that with these ridiculous?
Good afternoon.
Are you going to turn off this infernal fire?
I say, "I know it's not."
We listen to everything.
Now, I'm doing this.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary.
People who want to change the world, society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way.
Because hundreds become transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order.
What about love?
In this pedacy of the world, that the big world confies each one of us.
What if we don't do this?
Where can we be transforming facilitators?
For these revolutions.
And failed, and I kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
Can I do it with others?
Comundo and consistent.
I recommend a book: "The Korean conspiration of Marily Fex."
This movement that studied a lot, spontaneous, institutional movements, from a giant narrative.
"Beja Flow" doesn't have any ideology, he doesn't have flags, he's not cutting anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
From the morning, I'm seeing "Beja Flores," who came.
Each one talking about their water drop.
All of you who are necessary?
All of them.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you're in this stage.
But in stage.
It's your life story.
Tell your story.
And taking ...
Your ego had water, because it's always.
Can we turn a candle?
Instead, it's just complaining.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
Time.
In renovation.
I love it.
Poets.
I believed.
We use it.
Love counts like this and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with a poem.
It's to be silent.
Very good.
Renovante.
It's born enthusiasm.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multiply has arms to scenarios everything.
To destroy the eyes, to have seen you.
It creates others.
For other visions.
Strange arms that had this meat.
For you to forget.
From the kitchen.
Being always the same.
Always.
That's it.
But simple.
That's it.
Always.
Love.
And inside.
Anyway.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Laughter) Between a good school.
It decorates.
I took good grades.
The choice is the profession that will define you for the rest of your life while you're still a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, advertising, or a marketing.
Since my mother has no income.
I chose a collection of genome, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the least effort.
I received a channel.
Imagine a multinational company not recognized by their family.
Whether it's "treaming," it works 12 hours a day, it's high to the limit of its forces.
To be obvious, your cancer needs to be chronic.
I make interminable meetings, video games that wouldn't take anywhere.
It shows you that you are important for structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
Listen to the shirt.
(Laughter) There's someone who cares a six flexible point.
Namor, nievated, married.
He mini opponents.
Scale the pyramid of corporation.
Vista in the shirt, Lambotas.
A job exchange.
Being a manager.
The car of the firm.
Keep offraiding in happy hour, (Laughter) Happiness in the market.
Mrs. Cortados and sapatenes.
Dix, shirt.
Luke is the first apartment.
There's a child.
After two years, your second child is to listen.
(Laughter) Try the car, yes, year, no.
It buys a apartment that suffers 180 payments.
That first case is to be judged with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter)
Two years later, every seven days in Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami, (Laughter) more meetings that don't take anywhere.
completely disqualified people being promoted before you.
Projects that start and dismorate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of change.
The void that countries in the mall, in the weekends, can't apply anymore.
The download is a pleasure antenna that if it goes so soon, the market lake is broken.
I saw the shirt.
(Laughter) The first apartment in the beach, anxieties, antidepressants, a void.
The middle crisis, the encounter with college colleagues, "My God, we've spent years fast, life is short."
(Audience) Yes!
My children in school, my gods, as they grew fast, are short life.
(Applause)
We're well cut by alphabets of the center, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the end of the weekend in the beach, after the weekend in the mountain, we're going to sell the apartment of the beach, children grew up and don't even want to go faster, the shirt.
The external thing is a little high, its flat body, as an astronaut here spent years, producing zero gravity.
None car, because of the healthy habit of passing the file inside, puts all the infections.
There's "Fi," "Lactose Fry," "Sucoverde," "Planting semester of the academic that you used for two months, today it's fourth, day of ugly, hamburgers of felling until afternoon, in the film, they've planned a project because life is too short to eat the fast.
The vice-president, who, despite all efforts, has never arrived, probably never arrived.
The continuous fear of losing a job, today, doesn't value the most experience.
The fear of everything: the new generations, the change, the new one.
Why, in my time?
I'm afraid of the continuous that prevents you from living.
The complete disconnection with their children is decorating from the 12 hours of work in decades.
The empty retirement surrounded by useless and little affection.
You're a winner, this is your only console.
Your life is executive, executive.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
