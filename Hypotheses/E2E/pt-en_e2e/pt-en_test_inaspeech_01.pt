Have you ever thought about it?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should I have my role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
So I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre in that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers took the sewage to make some adjusts and that made the fall of the piece lose.
When they lost a lot of time, they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of this piece.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button, to facilitate the time to pass the head.
In fact.
For people who are quadriplegics, the ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person and for paraplegics, who give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for pattern?
I made a website.
Very ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
It's to think about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Are they ready and stamped?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition?
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
I don't know
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
That the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections, as an American atom that was already in their second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And the Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
My family always came from the rock, my life, in the middle of the forest, I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
And my biggest focus was to work with children, and I was designing people as a collector, to know how to separate a list of others, so I tried to talk to children, and I was gaining awareness of people, as an educator, and I spend with the children I know.
In my community, we have a collection of seeds, when it goes to the forest, it's a light plant that's called the name of Engar, it's a light plant that we plant everything below it, it's a plant that recovers the soil.
So I tried to imitate the forest because, when I went to the arm, I knew that all plants were used in our community, but I tried to imitate with a forest in myth, there was a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw that there was no plague, so I tried to plant them, variing, there I have a dirty, cup, graviol, Andiromba, Copaiba, Maru, Guaraná, and everything there, there's no plague, no tox in our community.
The child compared it and said, "You talk, she's listening, and then she's going through another child."
So, this was looking for my knowledge, we have to be a patient, we have to show the love, the greatest care for those children, and it was putting everything in the eye, my father says, "My father says this attention, then he talks to the other person's quote, he has to come home."
So, I'm a person who has always been where I walk, I'm observing, I'm a person who observes my house, kept observing my house ...
I saw that my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, everything is stupid, so I saw that all this with my work was doing with children, who is the future, and it's OK, and today we have it.
(Laughter) With a job inside, with the long run of the human being.
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, for those who don't know what's far from the human being, it's the Amazon tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're driving 25,000 children.
And we're repairing the river that, before, had a dam in front of us, and this dam, it cried and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the people who saw it.
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation to be able to live with nature, to understand nature, and I've always liked the forest.
So I'm going to pass to this person.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
We breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest is always talking to people educating children.
And, going through other people.
And I have a message to leave a very small phrase that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come and come to the next to us, there we're talking, and I'm very happy.
(Laughter) I'm yours, if I don't pass my message to my education to other people, I feel even guilty, absurd, and thank you very much for your album.
I'm gay.
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were raised thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
In my family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true and create this family.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
(Laughter) And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most siblings you're here, as we feel, as a fear of losing your child.
And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find it.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of method, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible, because all the more schools and all the larger friends, to give medule, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
(Laughter) And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
That when a child gives you leukemia and tries of life, all or rest of problems, of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Moreover, there's no relevance, it really matters, and we learned to be this lesson, and it spreads to our friends, to the most of the school, to society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
(Laughter) The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement found a donor.
It was that people saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father.
Or a more divorced warrior, or important, I love the family, this union, this is what gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease, to the world: "What?"
My blood, my thirsty medule, was able to manufacture them: our manufacture.
The blood is only blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human, so this secret raised this awareness, we have this ability to donate blood for those who need it and know it's not just that.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating "medula ossea" is each strange as the owner of "medula ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in my life, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, to be able to save in my life, and that's just the same thing."
Well, supporting us for this union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in Laikon.
It's good for you.
The base is like you.
This is deafness.
No, that's it.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I, in gender.
I studied at the University of Damasco.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not like that, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
"Hi, I'm a little crazy."
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brochancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do like this.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was 23 million people.
And it keeps!
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three fingers of clothes.
Honey of Engineering.
All those apartments.
I have a car.
In Damasco.
I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15.
It's 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities of the country.
My city in Damasco.
It was the safer of Syria.
There were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Hello.
After five years of war, one and the country is this.
Drawing.
Guys, those who know me were forced to carry or fit their children.
They found their fertile voices and mutilated by a bomb, they submitted and didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again.
Or not?
Today.
Millions of Syrian will drink everything, they've been killed or they've been killed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, our bars and our life will be back.
I still don't know if I'm going to be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'm going to live them again.
To protect my family.
I went to Barabai Ruti.
Then, ten months.
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So, I went to talk to the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
And you saw Pinas, or a week, to knock back.
I've been living for 40 years.
And start again.
In Brazil.
I arrived here in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like this: today, I have a Brazilian daughter.
Zara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday, and everyone talked very well, the food my wife did was to take advantage of the very well-known kitchen.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created the Facebook page, "Hey, Syria," that's why now everything has a paper cane, but the number... (Laughter) I'm there to eat Syria.
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world ...
I was closed Branus, and three people had an wrong idea about Syrian attacks.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a Muslim person."
Let's think!
That Oislam likes blood.
It's allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also Branuz or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of Islam.
A basic religion.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book, that kills a person in which she had killed all men and who read it from life, will be like the one who killed another, hosted corruption, a Earth, life, all men, Alcurão, Sura Tulmida, Vescolo, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
A kind of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When I saw a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, was my wife.
They ask questions, "How?"
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline desirai Jabi.
Today, they have other rules.
Men and women can't play, embrace, embrace, executive, of voice, marriage.
Some people wish me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Kebeijam is the hug.
Beijanzó, Tao island, those rules, more each person wants to eat, or not.
The debate brings some things to be the same way they have to be, that they don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, a doctor asked me if I drink alcohol.
Oh, it's PCSO.
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
Why? (Laughter)
Because those things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after we explain to ourselves, people always understand.
It's respect.
The perfect woman says we should respect all religions.
That all people have the same value.
What should we have?
Beautiful.
With all.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians.
The slam Tabéndez that we have to help the people who need.
Every year we have Elsaacá and we give two,5 percent.
From all our money to the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if poor people are Muslims, crystals or Jews.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil, the world knows the best Islam.
To conclude with "O" or "brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
They are their children.
"Wow, power, grow."
Together, based.
What is the cell phone?
I'm in the small stories of life.
I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of the Center Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always ready to not give up the love of those who always wait for cancer.
Those who always believe in it, don't even believe, soon because of hope, but in the daily lap, I know who suffers, the label makes food, my salary ends, just like this race, studies the girl, what they told me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot.
Cozinheiro.
Fascinera.
Why not hire me in the mall, I don't understand, if you put me so much to pay a secret course, but if you want to enter the office, or to disculp, put an event in it, to clean everything and wash the bathroom?
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation.
EME is to be a domestic, if it were for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the lunch told me, "You follow this race, go left, go to the left, enter that little room, that the vast is waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I'm here to talk about Facebook, it wasn't programmed, I was at home, I was at home, from the page, I'm a maid.
Remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was running, sometimes I don't even have time to think and see everything we've achieved in life, so I got there one day, in the middle of my life, and how do I use Facebook, how a newspaper?
I put everything that happens, my mother even takes me with me, "Hey, all you can do is Mom, it's my new newspaper, and then I decided to share the things that came to me in my mind, because I was a maid of domestics for seven years, and then I decided to share the things that came to me in my mind.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use the glass at her house and not even the bathroom.
In her house.
There was the bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, I compatted.
This first story on the Internet became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to various media, both international media and national media.
I took six London, the TV show in Germany, and many others, what I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot when I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose themselves and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the most valued domestic domestications earn for hours, so totally different from our country.
It was for the worker and work for the second: the sixth.
And then I was very excited to see so many books, and I've always got to her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, there are domestic, spending for these conditions, even today, there are domestic ones, spending 300 and 80 Brazilian reais per month, and there's a surprise in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several tests and I said, "Wow, I've been interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a story teacher, since I was a child, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
To help the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the month, and, thanks to some teachers and many class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lal Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who was not very heavy, today I came here to generate discomfort.
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I also went to Mexico, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I was also ready.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without photos, then they called me at least one interview, they took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship and that, and so on.
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are domestic apartments in the past, and it's the past not so far away, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today, modern senzala.
It's almost the case of employee.
She came running, and I was nervous because I kept waiting for her to get there, and when I get there, I was already with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Hey, Mina, it was so boring, because I've been waiting for a long time for her to get to get there, you're going to open the door, "Wow, my pattern has come."
My girl, I grew up since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered, I was there, I only wanted to see her married, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage.
Because Christmas and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take the copies of all the comforts, so if I'm going to clean the room, I'm calm.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you won 18/7 per month, you'll never win this value in another place, and I'll be here resisting, because I've also left my children in northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala."
It's the little kitchen of the employee, I just got to a new service service, because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought the sovereign.
It's the kitchen of the employee, today I'm here, contrary to statistics, so some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause)
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and raft.
And here today, after me, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
We'll decrease a little bit of inequality in this country, but only to see that six million domestic people are being represented now, because in other countries, many domestic people, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we're going to decrease a little, but a little bit of the storm.
Sound affection roots, unforgetted.
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny, left.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Sleigh your cell phones.
Not photographing.
Until I was scared.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Let's say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing eight, so, the conceptive day of my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did he already start?
I was feeling very painful.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I was almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Go to the stage.
It opens the word.
I have your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment, sponsors of inflammation.
The first past to mix.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door to the state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside it.
This feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
That's in the heart.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions, that I didn't know who lived a lot of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
I was there.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
To determine my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Do you remember?
Most of you?
Only he kept his gold.
Several of you.
Think.
"No, I need it."
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
(Laughter) Desligue, come this step.
It's not to get rid of you, it's to slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put your scholarships on the floor, put your cell phones on the floor. (Laughter)
(Laughter) And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection: those who connect to the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look at the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Look at her face like this."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss."
(Laughter) He was connected, guys.
Let's see people.
Did you see where you are?
Keep it.
(Making sounds using the lid) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born of fear.
"Are you afraid?"
Anyway, it's not this guy in front of you, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Of closed eyes.
Take this step with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university and Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have a strong direction center, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At this moment, a different piece of your mind is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system.
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took a hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touching the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took fingers to the Asa da Chica.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a connected vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space location system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What does the area take care of?
Open your eyes.
Strange.
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
Then you realize it.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
A habit in our lives is self-knowledge technologies.
On the planet, along with our evolutionary process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available, they are simple, but they are technology of it.
Great generation.
We already know that, in the future, the evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection, in fact, happens when you communicate authenticity to another authenticity: silence is a source of freedom.
It's TEDxT.
It's true that I had the first video, (Laughter) normally.
It's a demand of a legion of false ideas that asked for society.
Books, dolls, school family.
At least, it has an influence in English.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
16,16 languages, and almost always 6,000 different translations.
These fears and events like these here.
But as to allow people with hearing impairment, they can do it.
But it's also Portuguese, first one is transcribed in the animal language.
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially?
In topics such as "technology," "Entrortinment," which is the "e" we can translate as "diversion."
And do you get out?
The ones that come from an accident or the political, business, entrepreneurship, even literature.
There are talks that evolve the smells.
The theme is this inventive event.
It's that it's terrible that we have, then we don't.
On the other hand, the reduction.
I said, "My God, I'm 21."
It's translating that it's about getting into account the eye.
Talents in the NGO of TED.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that translator is a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do this day and translate it alone.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here.
Because I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
In these actions, how is it?
(Laughter) And to become something that is empowered, that I don't have a doubt of education.
And it's also one of the behaviors I had to study.
Because I feel a choice, a mine decision.
And try to commit myself.
Do you have the time left?
It's different from the air.
And it's called "Fongs," that works like this.
The only knowledge has investment.
A lot of research, a lot of work, many vertical hours.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent, pleasant, too.
The best thing that makes us, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be a million people.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, right, the majority.
Or how we call it "DC."
In the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese, where we have Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different, we have ten NC, the parents I'd like to quote here.
Very well. (Audience) Yes!
In fact, she has to hear.
A deep political crisis, isn't it?
My father, who today was being two years old, got hurt for primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four concerns in mathematics very well, and the dream of them was always power.
And to make some kids get up, that's why the one who lived our little girl from our girls called Taiopedas.
In some sides, my father had come from his beginning to his elderly logic, and his site also knew, as a commissioner, he had a material in a presence store.
It's in 1960.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in the cells.
And many of them felt as humiliated as their economic failure, my father decided.
My mother, who I've got a few years old, is my help, right?
It was not knowing about cooking.
My mother's wedding supporters and she decided to do tickets to sell.
So, despite not having to eat, many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and my father didn't give up, it was that we were destroyed to study.
And that's how ...
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's welcomed with the penalty of the national research for anxieties or homicides.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared.
(Laughter) When I got to the country, I went to the 19th grade, I got a bubble, the bank visited to appear in the house.
Today I'm thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the park, right?
But for my father, they would check up shaking, without knowing, they were living in the mountain.
The smaller conditions of what we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my life, of my greatest public, are my beloved children, Danieel, Cristian, Lik, the ones I've never put this cobacade for me, but for those I did.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and a part of it.
Coincident that encouraged four of us, my brothers, became teachers, education is to be an accident, at some point in life, and one of my brothers is an educator, also fantastic, creative, interactive, revolutionary, that applies.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion with initiatives on the TEDx has a fair TV.
What does TED mean, just like my father went to a simple way to explain them?
What makes us believe in what?
Think of everything.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where I can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where she explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then she taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super complicated, and I started to study Braille again.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I stopped buying a rule, which is a little that allows you to write in Braille, in which you write, that shows the release.
I ended up full of my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to the roots.
While I wrote her that I was learning, she gave tips, and with that, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Croz School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what she taught us, and we decided to create a clock where I could feel the time.
We started to research, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet and be ready to connect the engines, and we'd have a clock, but saw that there was no Internet: we decided to create robotics and programming with our teachers and try to set up the clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock and showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others, from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from interest in us could help even with our aunt and potentially many other people, and this showed us how necessary it would have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, and there's still a lot to be done to help people.
Let me ask you a question: What do you think?
There are adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people, they can go to handle.
OK, we're all in agreement, two or more adults, in a free and consent, can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is a expression I've made, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance crucial, is that there's a mutual exchange, that is, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit and another part with the objective of getting pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, and I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces, receive their clients in apartments, in horthes, or even street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve what I'm here to talk about.
Children?
Excats that involve less than 16 years or adults who are classified, or adults who don't feel that their consent is a crime case, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggressions of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer institution and forced constitution.
We're also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations, the tendency to confuse that by situation, against sexual exploration, is to confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks, human, almost all for lik exploration.
There are only three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify an judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disconnected from reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims, defenses, explored, and who are waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider the victim?
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people to immigrate economical inequalities, social and cultural inequality, we know there is a diversity of constraints that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I find a researcher interviewing conversations, I'm with people who do sexual work, what they say is that they will be an option, with a standard option after disadvantage and disadvantage activity, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
Thank you.
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who is replaced.
Think about it.
I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely to the lack of appearance and, of course, has someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes, they are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
In other words, experiences, inside positive experiences, not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, not only women driving, there are also many women of sex work, for example, when our image is equipped with when we think about prostitution from.
Someone on the street and I tell you that the studies that are made of accidental needs and try to stimulate the number of people who are in the beginning of sex tell us that...
Plete Saint-Drois.
Because it will only represent 10 to 20% of the total of deposited people.
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
(Laughter) They're less, they're minority, but they're not the ones who tell us that in other contexts this percentage will be even more elevated, so when the speech does about the victim of man or the teacher's work, they forget that there's a percentage of men who are in the sexual work.
(Audience) Yes!
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, designing.
FD: Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
In 1999.
It's not forbidden to sell sex, but there are victims without exception, and so, if they are victims, they are victims of a oppressor and a client, and, therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior. This law is adopted in violence to stigma and advertisement.
(Applause)
Another idea we all have is that this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
These are victims.
It's a decent that, without big study in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea that the client has a criminality.
It's a idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between us.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships, but there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of primary to clients, is dehuman.
What are the people who are the carriers of disability or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who go back to sex professionals?
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
And it's your pleasure, and many of them are able to do, as they have the right to their sexual security security, and now that they destroy any argument that tries to be in favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people can do this as an option?
(Laughter) If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Thank you very much.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
It controls the work conditions, if this can be done.
Without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmatisms so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the side of a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural, and we have a sexuality, it's considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural and that's where it's committed to sex.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural confirmation of the description of social rejection, like, for example, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination on sex translators, it's very strong in many consequences, stigmatization and social security.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever heard this word, "Don't TEDxBas," "The puta stigma is the worst that can fall on a woman."
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
(Laughter) The stigma of "puta" followed women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta is a tool that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that wakes up, the norms that are restricted socially, it's the risk of being called puta.
So, why do I think we can do any of us to do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators, and I think the path is one of human rights, of all included by ideological assumptions?
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to see silencing around the time, sex workers, so for everyone, organized by 70s, but, precisely because of stigma, their voice doesn't have creativity, they are not heard, we don't need rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
(Laughter) After all this.
And to finish.
Do you think it makes sense?
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex workers.
Thank you.
(Laughter) When we got there, when we got there, at the same time, in the last 10 years, in the third time, in the last 10 years, we were there, at the same time, and, especially the seduction of the women, of the children and of the brain, which is a technical record that can also be found in the heart, in the middle of the middle of the middle, in the middle of the whole area, in the middle of the middle of the middle of the city, and the whole area, in the middle of the whole room, that was union, that was unbeared, that was unbearable, and that was unbearable to beatable, and we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to get there, and have a compassionate, and have a lot of a compassionate, that was uncover, that was uncover, in a lot of a few people, with a lot of people, that was uncover, that was unbearable, and we had to beatabled, and we had to beatable, in the end, in the end, in the end,
If I respect this judgment of not violating, being ethical to enjoy interpretation between men in all times, and if the transgender turns the violin that happens to me, what's seen in the exercise of my process, or outside of it, and that doesn't convince the life of the sick people?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today you do a journey?
We do the judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed because the medical relationship is essential for the good cure, so today, few things are registered by a man's judgment, in this case, I see a wave participated in a profession that is registered for a John's judgment.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a very incurate individual, and it's going to lose all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical knowledge that produces science in a way that the next one could go further, what happened with this, the medical knowledge that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once, I was in a class in college, in a group of small groups, teachers, and I tricked with you to say, "Look, patients, there's so much, I'm in a class, I call everyone, and I say, "Let's see the recipe barriers."
And he looked at the certainty, as I see from the patient, and he noticed that he was smoking the teeth, he didn't smoke anymore, he was smoking, he was sweet, you can talk a lot about it, "The time you're leaving a patient, there's a moment of intimacy, you're able to remember something that doesn't take us."
Besides, when you're seeing the patient, you're asking you to see the patient, you're asking you to move him, at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you're taking care of you."
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to have a selfie, but it's replicated in science.
We don't know why it appears, there's no exame operation, there's no external interactions, there's no reputation, there's no way, it's a functional disease, it doesn't know why, every time more, the number of diseases happen, and this happens because our society is a little sick.
Some of you may raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the best relationship.
Because if you're not going to talk about a medium group, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor, but being a patient is a patient, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are missing for me.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two aspects.
My doctors count two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our cure process, in the decisions for the cure process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
And we didn't talk about Doctor Google, fashion, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were some puzzles, there was a book read by health, that didn't exist without giving up.
The difference is that in that occasion, for you to know someone, publish something, because it's a editor, to have content to say, "Today, a Google, you have a very important information lesson, but a lot of things we need to know is to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the ability to filter."
So, the mouse really hurt.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for anything, and that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money or gaming.
So, the second very important thing: it doesn't believe that the scientific society doesn't have a mature of this for a long time, the information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today and tomorrow is on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if there's a paranoid thing, like the industry, there's no interest that you're going on, so these things get me paranoid, it's not a president, it's silly, nobody slept in information, and finally.
Take the solution, discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information, information, knowledge, catch information, participatively from your cure, but disculp your doctor.
Second thing, the very important thing to be active is to be born in a process of cure, is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what medicine is, you have the right to know what risk of that surgery is, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I've been working for 20 years."
I know it's a long time, but I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture to exist.
The doctors want to have the right, they don't want to have this attempt, like the name now, they want to have it with chaos.
Audience: Yes.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in Veneto Vela, I had a translator for the son, who was very good at the Portuguese, and I prescribed a conflict that, for me, was a doctor who obviously didn't talk about Germany, and he didn't have a patient there, who had a transcendence, who had a ticket.
This magic, all the interest of taking care of that other individual, had all the interests of taking care of it, at that moment we talked about, I have a completely different culture of the other, which is the art of reading, has a completely different culture of the other, that has delivered its soul, so it doesn't need to contribute.
We, who aren't going to do because of a connection, can try to find more unity in our most compassionate treatment and all patients.
(Laughter) I'd like to talk to you about a story that changed the most or less a digital decision for two seconds: this number is the amount of decisions of a human being made by guides, and the interesting thing is that, for this group of people, the majority has chosen a digital option, which has been built as well as the institutors.
I learned a lot about this in a theory that has two options in the idea, and it seems a little bigger than the Cystic Fibrosis of the UN of Tiret, because I have a lot of time to influence people who choose the option TI, and I think they're close and they're a different way, but they'll see that they're really close to the question.
So, from these 35 million decisions that we have, it was at the same time, gathering this concept with the concept of the Church Revist of Economics, if the person wants to bring the knowledge of the behavior to the digital world, but he was working on a research company, and in the world of technology, and even the name, in this profession, who has a lot of information, and we didn't have a lot of effort, and we didn't have a lot of effort, and we't have a lot of effort, and we't have a lot of effort, and we't have a lot of effort, and we't have a lot of affection, and we't have a lot of affection, and we have a lot of affection, and we have a lot of affection, and we have a lot of it, and we have a lot of effort, and we had to bring it, and we had to bring it, and we had to bring it to bring it to bring it to bring it to bring it to bring it to bring it, and we have a lot of it, a lot of it, and we have a lot of effort, and
So, when I go to this area and eat a person, how many decisions will we be trying to make the use of the digital camera, or that the medication will spend a lot of stories in the world, will we interact with this decision as I am, and we put the "weis" and we put the "weis"?
(Laughter) (Laughter) In this case, it's a number of doors and men, which, in Austria, is 90, (Laughter) (Laughter) in this case, is a number of doors and men, which in Austria has already been adopted by the worst.
You need to ask to leave, in Dinamarca, you don't need to ask to enter, so there's a magic word called "deflow."
This word is what you're already, so someone decided that I wanted to offer the senses, and another to receive Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people, (Laughter) and here to get out, without doing anything, it's the decisions I call the birth card, you don't want to go there and go out.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked, so I got a story, I thought it was cool to meet another person, but I talked a lot about Uber's motorcycle, I don't know if you take Uber that year, and a lady chooses the cube.
When the guy arrived in another person in the car, and he looked strange and said, "I'm like this, there's another passage in the car, and he looked at him and said, "You've chosen the cube."
So, Marse Learning chose not to know, (Laughter) but it's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are, if we do Google today to research where people eat, there are 567,000 results, what do we click?
(Laughter) Ninety and one percent of people explain in a state of the first Google page, will those who chose a place we eat as a person, and I was the same?
(Laughter) In fact, this is Google, it's Uber, it's Uber, it's a bit like this... (Laughter) I love Perfect, and I see there's peace in the seven clics, so I can ask this.
These little birds in English have a name in the behavior economy, also have the name, they don't realize what they're doing, (Laughter) they're a phenomenon, there's a cell phone, there's a theory of a game called "Digitals," and it's exactly an English imporonym, I'd like to ask you to give an emporrosis to give a little person at the topic person in the cell phone.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself, I thought there are adults."
(Laughter) And in this talk, I'd like to take a picture, and it's important to see ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of life here, 300 and 70 conversations, (Laughter) If you don't want to be low enough to stay in this link, generally that people ask me, "How many people I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave in the world?"
This can make us manipulate someone.
Knowledge is a tool: the danger and this is that yes, if you have it, you can use it to do what someone buys, it's something she doesn't need, or you can say to the good.
As, for example, you can use to make a patient from diabetes come out at the time, that is also harmful.
Or you can say, to avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same athlete, which makes the medition of the celebrating waves to detect a kitchen to edit a accident.
So, in these 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
AC: There's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine it was like that?
(Laughter) And I believe that every time we're immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual reality, machine learning, because it's funny in the game that brings the tone with the concept of increasingly present reality in our lives, and I believe that if we understand better.
How do these puppets work?
We'll be able to build a better world, we'll be able to build better interfaces, and we'll be able to be more aware for us to make better decisions, thank you.
