I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
What does this mean?
That the true character of a society is revealed.
For the way I treat your children.
But in Brazil, we are living in paradoxes.
And our children are what we have the most precious.
We want the well-being to any cost, to give us our lives for them, and, however, our children are being very bad treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and demands that we can change, and I hope to make a little with you today.
Audience: Yes!
And if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what about most?
According to Mandela's criteria, we are a terrible character, because we deny basic rights such as health, housing, food, we treat them with violence.
And if they rebel themselves, we ...
And we offer her the prison.
But even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and children of you who are here.
The thing doesn't work well, we commit, maybe we don't crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is starting against childhood, and we'll take the wave of Gabriela, a child of middle class, typical class.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, of affection with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, this baby that will be born, and she begins to go to Navidad, and, quickly, the indigenous industry, which is very convincing, which produces the culture of Cesare, a culture that makes women believe that the normal birth must be a natural birth in our country.
Among 15 to 20% of the developed countries, this generates enormous benefits for children, this makes us lose this moment of love, and replaces for a medical, surgeon, a woman, adopted, immobilized, and, of course it can be humanized, and it can be well done, but certainly won't have the same benefits in a normal part.
Remember that, of course, there are cesáreas in these areas for each of these pecates we're going to be.
And we are criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me, the same way happens with a mother's milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But, already out of maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working will say to her age, "You can take a mammal, it's an indigenous formula in your case, it's hungry, it's hungry, it's alive, it's strong.
The child is crying, the ear is weak, in two months, this child is breastfeeding, and she loses marvels that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the house of the industry.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms: "Premean," "experpray."
Surprising, Materno Tadinho's milk is an amator, but he just comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industries do the advertisement directly with the doctor, doing the doctor, convincing his employees and dinner qualities and congresses, and integrally by the medical societies, conquering the pediatric sympaty that ends unconsciously, being one of the biggest basic causes, and in this way we're losing.
The privileges of the amydation, and they try, through the first pecado, which is the privation of the natural birth of the maternal leiting, serious health problems in children, in mothers, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovering now.
And my mother grows, her mother will end up in essence, she'll go to the church, because her grandma can't take care of it.
And she'll spend six, eight, ten, twelve hours in a institution, but get home, her parents are regretted from tired from a long workplace, in bottles, and they'll live little with her daughter, and they'll take a shower because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens is that we lose what is more precious in childhood, we, as much as it depends on our adolescence, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their lives.
The coexistence is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children, and we are losing it, because of this terrible pecking perception of the child's perception.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, they don't have money to pay employees, and they end up exchanging, we ended up exchanging the Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy, for a rich food, fatigue, saturated, huge salt and sugar arms.
Crocants out there, swallows inside, all the weapons that industry, through food engineering, highly developed, do so that children can be completely addicted to healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're annoying.
This leads serious problems, like diabetic obesity that we're lost in childhood, and even if we want to give food, that we get from healthy food, because it's not so healthy, because it's in one of the agrotóxes data, and we're worldwide consumption champions.
This is the sintoxication of childhood that also leads serious problems.
Gabriela will go to a church that has cables, for four months, and someone knows that it's highly negative to the involvement of a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run to play, go out, and, however, in our urban life, it doesn't allow them to leave children to leave, she stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise she can, she doesn't block me, and doesn't want this entire world.
So these children spend eight statistical people.
Eight to ten connected hours with your devices today, again, connected with the yellow device, it's great, but not eight hours followed, children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is increasing.
And since we were a child, it's a wonderful thing: we'd play a damage, those who play a damage, things that stay in the memory of us in childhood, we'd look at the window, the landscape pass in a form of meditation, so today it's two babies and two stages for each one, if we can't do something in the car, right now, right?
(Laughter) Even in moments, where the child needs more money, this exists, this comes from the weapons, you can go there, punish the hypothesis.
It's this name, Hipport, still comes with a layer to cover the tablet, and this is what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive distraction, and this makes us confine our children, and by asking them to have a moment of consciousness, of empty, of TED, fundamental, in childhood.
Because Tedio Vazil is a berce of what is most important for us: creativity and imagination, and we are pushing this from our children with this peculiar confinement and permanent distraction.
In April, there are four hours of television per day, it's massacred by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because we have less time in school.
And then, in the weekends, of course, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program of the Brazilian family at the weekend, which is O.
Very well, but it will be more massacred by advertising, by consumption values, and this advertising is a covard mobility, it's a property that explodes its ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
What explore love for characters, doing what they do?
It falls in love with toxic products, poor games, cars, and brands, inclusion of this love, and that instills values as an obsessive consumption.
The hyper-realization of appearance.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree.
In obesity, it's going to disagree, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that the beer in Brazil is not a drink in alcoholic, it's not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, and, obviously, those who need friendships are the teenagers, and they are deep consumption.
Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want it to be competitive, a very successful adult, and her agenda gets full of commitments, to relax from this stress, they increase one hour than the meditation class.
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who's already in the middle of the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." (Laughter) There's no beautiful meditation, which is this one.
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this: the type of erotization that our society proposes, in desertion, that uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization, which is based on machismo, the objectification of women and sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their heads completely when they've been eight or ten years old, this is the date of the end of childhood and the erotization for what?
Gabriela has parents who are afraid of her, because they don't live with her, so instead of limiting them, they put them in a trunk, she passes to be the queen of the family, and not the member of the family, she earns many gifts, and when she needed, you see the present.
And she realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, she needs people who drive her life, this is generating taste and generating symptoms, and we know that it's important for our children, and we're losing this ability, instead of this, we're doing what the Americans call "Helicopters/hopéranting."
We interrupt each other between children's experiences and the world, making them not have the experience of life, and, therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver them later, this is the peculiar.
Introonization and superproduction is a very easy one: Well, before so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, shine, belt, and will eat too much, or will be obese in school, it doesn't pay attention, it's imperative, we need to do something about it.
And it's not possible for these children in this way.
In the same way we take these poor children and put them on the chair.
What's the solution we're not going to give to the bad-comported children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, the medicalization, we're going to give medicine, be ready for them to behave well, this is called "medicalization and optical."
Kin, from Mafalda, says this: "Take a wonderful way, they buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact, what the fact is that people are doing with these children, not only with the elastic children, adults in an overwhelming way.
Medicalization of the most popular phenomena.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are so far away with this competitive and individualist society, right?
The three colors are the market that grows the most for depressive, we're arriving at this point, and the ritaline, the medicine of the medicine, which is for the disturb of attention and interactivity?
It sold in 1999 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't the epidemic of disease, this is a massacre against childhood, we're spinning, normalizing, and asking for children to be themselves, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, in humanity, were there today in school?
It would be exactly this: on the other hand, not martized, and we would have held on its genius and we would have lost what was wonderful in the process.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but for the whole problem, complex of humanity, already said philosophers, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
It's obvious.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I think we reflect on this, a very useful solution to TEDx, I'm also going through my time, but it's OK, it's just a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what can we do? When we talk about pecados, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today, means "dismo," in almost all the churchs, the album is part of what we have most precious to our childhood, our children, which are our sacred.
What do we have more precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
Time?
We have 17 waters.
These are 7 hours we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This gives a lot of 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's only to priorize, and if we don't give, in the weekend, we start to connect in the weekends, it's possible to live time in our children.
In relation to space.
I'd like to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, my own self-confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a greater city, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not a good place to live.
Let's see this place.
How would he be?
Look at your eyes.
And they tell me if you fit in this statement.
Yes, right?
I'm sure most of you, yes.
And this shows us a little the importance of nature among us: nature is profoundly associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul, we know what is left to us.
What we don't know, and there was an interesting experience.
I started with the pattern behind, who wasn't giving me my presentation, and she said, "Wow, but you're talking about something incredible!"
I talked about the convergence, health and sustainability, and I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment, everything that makes good health, and vice versa: riding a bicycle, making a body, my city, the pollution, collective transport, makes good, for the time of coexistence, and income.
Look how wonderful it is!
And when I say "levate children" by nature, we're not talking about spaces when boys with fat spaces, they're going to afford us from stars, they'll give us a moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce the consumption of immensive material, they'll be small, mental, and play in the squares.
To occupy public spaces, with games, with love, affection, with coexistence, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this.
And not only the initiative of physical use has been reinvented by public policies that facilitate us in contact with public space with nature, that promote psychology.
According to the free events of these spaces, the urbanization, the gardens in schools, the high cities, public transport to take these places, security.
Cessive and well-carded squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, it's the word occupied, practically used for citizen resistance, and, above all, it means that, occupy public space with joy, and with sustainability.
To conclude, the same scientists who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, who is coming from there, will live very early, our children will take me full, and also say, in 97% of scientific consciousness, there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this, including who matters, and it's cool, we participate in this.
And taking children outside, taking the children to the square, to the water, to the invitation, to empathy, we're going to learn to take care of others, and we're going to reduce inequality, taking the children to nature.
We're going to do with those love and nature because only experimenting the ice cream, not seeing in YouTube, and we learn to love this box and defend it in the future, which we only defend what we love, so, in summary, this proposal.
It's this, and since we're talking about utopia, guys, I'm often showing myself in the Galiano phase that left us this year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is in the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more it affects, if it approacts 1,000 steps, it affects 1,000 steps, so that it serves utopia exactly to make us walk.
What makes us walk outside?
AC: In 2007.
AC: I came across a big group of young and adults.
With disability, excluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge was to look and see people's efficiencies are marked by their disabilities.
So I created the Cafétherapeutic project, the group of parents, students and friends, searching for a really inclusive society.
AC: To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school.
With parents.
With their children and with their partner.
People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents.
Pommunity.
It's in general.
People with disability.
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
Let me have friends.
On the other hand, think they're not able.
I'm going to have friendship.
To interact with people.
Take the case of the Igor's student, for example.
And what else did he study?
(Laughter) For four years he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
And people didn't make an effort for that too.
So, over four years, he was in the court taking part in all the physical education classes and, as he loved running, he was running all the time.
I said, "Are you getting to the clean field?"
I sought to know Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school, and what would we do together?
For him to be able.
They were better learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a place.
Of despair.
Well, isn't it that it's a clean one?
And today, it's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on his parents' Day.
I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And it can teach the student to enjoy it.
The own learning.
Schools think.
That they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
He needed to use it.
And I believed.
(Laughter) They are capable and that these children inside the school.
To do good for them.
It's going to do good for other students.
For school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities.
The learning of others.
(Laughter) Why did I look like this?
I have what I know, I have what you know, and I have what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people.
So, can I see?
I learned.
You can do it.
My erudition.
AC: I lived with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
And I learned to appreciate my ideas with those that often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart and the heart of my students.
To create connections.
And friendship laps.
And the most important thing for society?
AC: It's learning the exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been to cook: when I was a child, I loved to see my grandmother cooking.
To cook, to work in the kitchen, she who took account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hand in their hands, in fact, were my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen, it's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I started to realize that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies and treatments of diseases, as a form of medicine.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many young people.
which is the Cuidated zelo and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we ...
It builds the food system.
Through food.
I believe that...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
It's the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's good for us.
Try a little of the rural life for the city, we can strengthen the laws between men and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way we can reconnect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in health terms, but also to improve, to use as a tool.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we started.
It's to reestructure the food system, change the food dynamic.
The process of production, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example.
There are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it is produced, the more cheap it produces.
The worst is quality, and the biggest cost for the environment and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is accelerated artificially, the animal's life cycle is accelerated artificially, and it starts to grow and produce in a way that your bodies.
It's time when it doesn't make it, and it begins to lose, to decrease dramatically, its quality of life, its health and its time of life.
So I believe that we can and should change this food system, I was the other day passing from the supermarket and realizing that the kilo of Franco was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex, this didn't enter my head."
Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotoxic products in the industrial scale, and for the environment, because each Brazilian consumes, in average, 5 kg of agrotoxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why.
But the answer is why our current society ...
There are inverted values, there's an alergic reaction because you don't know the procedure, you don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal, right?
And why is that?
So, I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values, and we need to teach people.
To appreciate the organic products, because when you buy a well-being of the producer, which is something that people don't know that behind that alphace, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why I ...
I think I fell in love with the culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient, I think you must know that we produce a lot of food, a third of the food we produce.
It's simply desperate, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why there are people still passionate about hunger, and the reason is a "mapolitics of distribution," we have to reveal this.
And in terms of consumption consumption, the way we consume today is scary: my grandmother is paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
What if I took her to put her in the middle of Paulista Avenue?
I'm sure it's very scared, seeing those executives or those appealed people walking on the street, talking about the cell phone, swimming a piece of pizza, for example, because it's also very important.
And it's...
And then?
These feet foods, these quick foods, were made the same way, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our art, clanding, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, or we end up opening space to the streets, which is very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little biscuits and so on, there are also many chemical adjectives, and a level exaggerated from Salvador and Açúcar, which are the three self-viciating, right?
And these, mainly, food remains, for me, are food and food spots, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes jokes, instead of buying that small pack of panels, that pack of panels in the microwaves, look, half a half, (Laughter) who still makes jokes, also half a half a half, huh?
(Laughter) This question may seem a bit harmful, but, in fact, it means a lot, just to exchange the popcorn of microwaves, a package in this that could be a less trash in the world, so I think the excessive consumption of industrialized products is a lot.
Prejudicial, right?
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think it's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
Cozinha.
It's this name of art, culture, leisure, health.
To cook brings independence, bring autonomy, self-knowledge, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry.
Because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes, so if you leave the industry feed you.
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What about a pizza?
And it's about scripts, because not even Pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we're ...
"Ah...
I think there are many people who don't have the price for the kitchen must think that making food is very harmful every day, wake up in the morning, but, for example, if you leave the mirror of each day, that keeps our belly and our soul.
Let yourself be frozen for the rest of the week.
Junting with a fresh street, who makes you 20 or 30 minutes, more the legumes you've already cut and washed in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and, half an hour, you have the ready reflection.
This would be perhaps the same time you would take to wait the pizza to get there.
Esperal of Pizza's book.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: "Men, woman."
Children, girl, child, adult, and elderly.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education, we teach children to take the fair children to choose the vegetables that will have to dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, the value.
Simple things in our daily lives, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic vision of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think it's from the supermarket practice, so we're children good.
To grow regardless of the food industry, because they will be much less sick, growing with a food of wedding, a healthy food, I believe we have to change.
The food dynamic, we have to value the food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to leave, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
It has less hospitals, this is education, education and prevention, then?
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
cooking.
And choosing good food is choices we can do to change the world better.
Thank you.
Life is not the one we live in.
AC: But that's what we recognize.
And how do you wake up?
It's here in the background.
To talk about the transforming power of stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family came here, I came here, when I was a child, to spend vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandmother, Mari Güeyuça, was the first tribe plantator of the mechanized work in Brazil, here in the earths of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother Tília and, after having had seven children, inside them my mother, who got married with my father, I got to this world, casually.
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are, and we want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history, before looking at this future, we need to see.
Those who come back and honor all stories.
Still, my passion for stories started very early, I always liked to write, to read, to tell.
In school, I even wrote a book called "Scaminhos," which talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened, this book helped me live the mourning, so having used this story to bring me one of the most beautiful things about this.
That it's the power that people can feel welcomed in the history of others, feel in the colore of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because, obviously, someone will live and sit in the school of this story and feel welcomed.
(Laughter) But one day, I met this whole world here, from TEDx, and I met incredible people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
I talked about products, I understood at the age of 45 that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories because the world of advertising had already been very small for me.
So I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable today, but he brought me another challenge.
That it was to talk about bubble, because that was what he always suffered, and he wanted to share the story with others, but I throw you away.
While we prepared to talk about it, he always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints with the right.
Especially what they had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, being to keep complaining who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can accept who they are, how we've already said, without fear?
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, the people I know they know, also to have seen that the rod they imagined that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defense.
(Laughter) And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story a lot of people.
He welcomes me in his story, the week went by, he sent me a audio saying that many boys have sought him, even more in the air.
At the time, it's so expensive to dialogue and acceptance.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story, and he hadn't assumed this for people in a way that he didn't have any shame.
So, to tell stories to me?
These are micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but also in my own of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear, we change ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this for seven years.
I'm training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give a tip about how to start, about asking a question to the audience, show the picture of their children, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important, and for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
It has to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has the heart color.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, the avenue, the teacher of the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening, and we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDx Laçador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day?
And two weeks before his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with it."
Every time you talk to me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: when, in fact, you have to leave everything here, you have to be in the heart, and it changed everything.
And one day, he gave an incredible talk about the listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the person in Switzerland when he had cancer.
What made him study about this, and he taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, there are so many written instructions, but who's worried about learning how to listen.
We transform ourselves, and we saw this today, that when we listen to truth, because he tells me, and we are afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and as we always get there and say.
I'm not going to listen to us and to others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time for people.
Because we are worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
And this, after listening to his talk, made it.
The other TEDx.
(Audience) More.
(Audience) And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most varied ones I heard.
Follow all the others.
For example, when we say on the street, many of us, that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, we have, we have at least a smile, and he doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others, we transform ourselves.
What about this other?
Listen and count, he also changes, and in the midst of the crazy preparation, which was the process here for me, was outside my trip.
I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do great, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, helping people, and the answer for me, and for everyone.
I came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now I'm sorry, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know, to give her the key to their lives, to give them the faith in life.
The right to love, not to love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, wanted to free many people I know, to say they have the right to change the right to cry, to free themselves.
I wanted many people I know to have at least one minute of rest, then they could look at the side and come back to smile, tell and hear.
And you, what stories are you going to tell about your life, what stories do you want to tell about you?
Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, is why, in fact, I'm part of the true step, or there are no judgments?
There is no Stella Gorda or Magra, beautiful, rich or poor, where there are all kinds of stars and stars, they don't pull roles or classifications, they are only belonging to their plural spaces.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, during a very obscure phase that fell over my life.
A phase that was denied to me, the right to just be born, but to resist and always exist, was always my life condition for me.
From the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
A woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
That's why I wanted this poem, because he does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the star in the sky, the universe is infinite, no one was covered or the beauty of the other.
So, why is it that we, here below, so small, can't reproduce something so simple, that accepting empathy and understanding definitely that the difference adds?
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal.
And this is rich, that's why we have the privilege, and the opportunity to be different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, is incredible when we feel someone different from us, the different is beautiful.
AC: Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a cape flight, where I could be myself, where I laughed, where I cried in my body, where I questioned God, why I was different.
Well, the bathroom transformed into the best friend.
He was always there, after a replete of bullying, or when I wanted to put his place in his head and dance rebel, because I only rewarded until today.
But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me?
The best, the reason why I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom and the answer is simple: the fact that I'm different.
From then on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad, and why?
And, during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see friends of mine transitioning, and that desire to grow inside of me, folks, I want to become a trunk like this, everyone coming, so I thought and started in a wrong way.
I wanted to mirror myself in the other, so during my artsenic graduation, I had the opportunity to know myself in front of me, theater showed me a new world, and it was a divisor of water in my life, so I started to look for my true decency and I started to disappoint myself, it's as if you enter a casula, it was a time there, and this is a beautiful bubble.
However, this process has painful phases and that not everyone is standing to deal, it's difficult when you're in the middle of a flow of changes.
And if you're a black, fat woman, this hardest path, we're going through many tests every day.
In the case of us, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come, is it that you bring, our new thing, there's no traffic face?"
I said, "No, you're doing this, go for it.
FR: People.
Who are the choices and the life expectancy of 35 years?
There's something crazy here, "Do you want to see your teeth?"
While men exist, have their life expectancy of 76.
Who are aware, chooses to live in the country that kills trans people all over the world?
And I wouldn't choose that.
I said, "So?
They question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the entrance to the National Association of transvestite women.
He said that we, transgender women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, in 144 people who were killed here in Brazil, 2016, facing 21 deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have up to 9 times more chances of dying with the risk of belief and violence.
Being trans isn't an option, but in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's a wheelchair and a force, resistance, expectation for 35 years, there's no way that we could mediate the best panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here in the whole afternoon explaining to you how I brought my life story, but in each one of us, it's the protagonist of your own story, understand the difference, something that can definitely change the world, and only depends on ourselves.
For example, I'm proof of this, after I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish about me, I created Kana Noutube, where I was becoming reference to other people, not only trans people.
I was invited to live a trans character in a teacher who exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
It's more responsibility.
(Applause) It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about differences for so many people.
Representing a flag and being proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went out of my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like "Man capable," "Mostro," you'll never be a woman, "Morra," what doesn't have a company.
What doesn't have a price is to receive a message of mothers from other trans girls, degraded me.
Because of teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best is to receive a message of other trans mines with brilliant eyes.
And thank me.
To see me there, and if you see me, this doesn't have a price.
Understanding the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
But I also understand that I don't want to be just a stranger.
Translation is only a small part of what I am.
I'm far beyond this, I'm too far.
But to understand this, I have a place of unknown, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plural beings, the agreek difference.
The sky is the refugee of being isolated.
Who was me, a being there?
A huge blue dancing.
Freedom without limits: me and the sky, the sky and me.
I've already delivered my corridors, not more looks, I don't ask myself to stop, but the rest is a scary.
That marks my soul, but the future, what does the future promise?
That's what I want: a side, now I'm, now I'm going to fly.
(Applause) I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've been doing work with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
A beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we opened our heads, we opened the belly to take the tumors, which the doctors called "thereatoma," and even with all my knowledge about communication, many times I couldn't explain to the children what cancer was, what was in treatment, the protocols, the procedures were not going to take a sex.
(Laughter) Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate, I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point, nothing, and it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and I didn't have it, at the same time I stayed with cancers.
(Laughter) I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
(Laughter) The belly dropped everything, I called the nurse and asked, "Are she talking about cancer?"
(Laughter) So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's outside the visite time."
So I asked her to handle me.
Until I slept, I just cut it in the room.
I used cancer, metástasis, and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because after all, I didn't realize it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter)
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was the safe information at that moment is that I would die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone if you can't even say the word "cancer"?
And I was a doll.
And I opened what bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized this information of society to graduate in hair, in fact, the surgery wasn't for me, the worst for them, that I wasn't able to see myself a doll.
And with that, I saw several other information that I thought it wasn't the most adequate.
When I entered the hospital, Careca, I got from you, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer, children said, "Wow, you'll be a hair to stay like us, I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I don't get it."
But the players overwhelmed, and the children started talking about procedures, when I did chemotherapy before, the first I did for Veia, I received a kit from the hospital, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a cow and a bread.
And I didn't have hair.
And this, for me, is information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent to the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through it, and what happened to me, children started to give me their procedures."
So they showed me, sent videos, working, chemotherapy, going through radio, several procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we were playing, but when we explained that chemotherapy caused the fall of hair, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong remedy, that's why it falls fast, but not only the cells of the tumor and the hair click, they understood, they still say, "Oh, it's working!"
And we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day the doctors started to connect me.
If there's a patient who's going to put a paper, if you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs," "Oh, but then I have a patient who's going to put a leg, you can come here, and I'll say that information is focused on the patient.
But the patient approached the end, this patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we stayed for a long time listing what we thought could improve, what we had doubt, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but with a very important thing: sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love with the heart, you draw the ventricles.
I think it's good, so we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes: these terms came out of our first material, which was a guide, and it's still distributed to 3,000 guides per year, if we had a patrocinator in the audience.
(Laughter) We have, for 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: hospitals started to use, to ask for children from New Zealand, Japan, several places, and I'd say, "But there's a Portuguese," but we have a translator, and the GI is very asked in the northern northern order, because children and parents, many times, many times, we're going to do more than 40 hospitals.
With this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
And to make several other actions.
The information, guys, is very important, and the information sometimes isn't only that thing, the technology of information, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotic modernity, sometimes the information is a pent in a kit, so what we say, and we prepare.
That if you need information in everything, for example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, children, dolls, earn much more present and pay attention to what the hair is, but sometimes the child is careful at some point.
And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, you have that society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if putting a careful child, sad, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money, but you can look at the website of Biabax, there's no.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "My daughter is giving me a lot of problem at home, and, suddenly, I receive the obligation of parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Will I go to the hospital to see what a difficulty is?"
OK, the mother wants to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people would look to pass to the window, to see, to a good life, and at that time we need self-esteem, you only have information that put you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, it's not easy because it's the dependence here in my disease and a disease of the brain and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
But what if, in fact, and if the answer is inside us?
To treat the chemical dependency, what if, in fact, these patients have reason?
It's in search of this that we thought about many things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of these defense defenses, which can be protected by big threats, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and don't do bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they are very small molecules, and for being very small, they have a almost balanced passage for the ematoencephalic barrier, and that's why they end up entering and acting in our brain in the circus of recompense in another circuit.
But we also have another system of protection, which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria and viruses and substances as well.
Well, then.
Can't we add these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are innatos, which are us?
A few years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day when some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs, they produced anticops against their own drug.
It's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
Now, it's enough.
AC: You don't need drugs in the system, you're overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use this immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
AD: Yes, my team.
A few years ago, we're researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system, a message of hope.
In other words, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to earn new freedom and control it.
How does this substance work? This substance is located in our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticops, and anti-coffs are large molecules, and then that problem that the barrier really leaves disorder, which is when the user...
It's consuming drugs, this little molecule connects itself to a big molecule, and "pum," it's no longer on the bottom of the cefarium.
And look at this image, how is this beautiful process?
Here, the right to you?
We have a while that didn't receive the vaccine, these white dots you're seeing, it's a doll molecule still marked with radiation.
In other words, when these rats are not immunized, they receive this cocaine marked with radiation, they freely pass and accumulate in the brain of these animals.
Once we managed to immunize them, and then you can see, on the left side of you, there's a pretty significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, which means that, probably, this cocaine that passed, stopped passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rats have a much greater radiation concentration than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides blocking the drugs were arrested in a blood fabric.
The other very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is the vaccine of therapeutic or vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency, so our group is standing inside the box or more inhibited than they don't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
Those who know, for a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time, time to decide, a time to win the freedom again and...
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much.
"I'm being."
A psychotherapist.
It's more than 40 years.
And I want to say that ...
Besides.
It's painful.
Isn't it nice?
It's a bit of psychosis.
There's a terrible disease.
Finally, everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
Who's ever said, "No, Pierre, go.
And me?
We denominate "normal."
Patology of normality.
And I have to say that ...
Maybe these ones are one of the encantation?
The big encounter of this TEDx.
In Saturday.
That's it.
No, the song is sitting.
Ponctuate from the beginning.
What is the nurse?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some sense.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for this, it's an example.
The most dead.
What is love.
Or even where I can understand, there are two foundations.
The most important of the norm is the situation.
Systemic.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
From respect to the fact that the norm hasn't always existed.
And it's not always existed.
The norm is a typical disease.
What about moments?
I said, "What?"
And we live in a context.
Where predominates.
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, of predominating corruption.
Disumanity, in its word, is egocentrism.
So, is it normal?
This is to adapt to a sick and maintain system.
I've been.
Is it a worker?
About 30 years ago.
From the International University of Paz.
The only step.
And people think that peace is in the good one.
What happens is the absence of conflicts.
I said, "No.
"Dad, it's good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars, Perei, who came to be a little paid?
The one who's military for the father.
But with other weapons.
The weapons of the responsibility.
Is love compatible?
So ...
It's the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The healthy person is the one who has the ability to present symptoms.
"So, but with you?
Sometimes it's even true.
A conscious, light despair.
A indignation?
Juste.
This makes me remember.
Isabelo, when my daughter's words had five years old, and today she's 34.
And there's a 8-8 boy.
The mother asked, "What's the princess you like the most?"
Is Gata Borlera, Cinderella?
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought.
And he answered.
And I like all May's written.
And I too.
And I, too.
I respect many people who say more.
Sometimes because it has to be the same to feel.
The own skin.
I love contradictions.
That "normatic" don't know.
People who looked for me?
With panic disease, for example, all of them.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
That they captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is it the fear of a family system?
Is it a myth?
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel disimate.
And forests.
They're desertified, and these people say, "Dad!
My respect is the world.
People denominated by psychotics and neurotics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten themselves.
That's why, in Africa, people who are considered crazy are also considered blood.
Because they are like a paradise that captures cultural contradictions.
Systemic.
And sometimes it doesn't stop.
And how did I say it?
I said, "Stop!
The difference between them.
A santo in a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where others don't know.
And he doesn't say anything.
Maybe these people, at least in a big measure we call it.
In psychiatric, they are healthy to hunt.
And I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consciousness, a dream.
The problem is in the weapons, it's the people who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
I said, "That's it.
I think of a occasion that I came from a seminary here in Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, when I knew I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing, he's good.
It's target of bullying.
People get rid of it, my son, what do I do with my son, he's good?
I don't know if you understand.
"What am I trying to say?"
It became a lunch.
So ...
I have to say that all the people I have.
Respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team organized this encounter.
That nothing against the correctness.
At that moment, "Oh!
What is suffering from a desert?
So ...
You talked about the nurse, the machismo.
Racism, homophobia.
From different ones.
Exclusions.
It's great.
We could say, "No, it's environmental.
The nurse of ultra-specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
No, no.
And if the editor takes fire, and each one is looking at the minimum, he doesn't realize, his existence doesn't make sense, we're using it.
In an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
To do the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe that's it.
Let's do a concept.
In this education that has also been here.
To point.
As I feel a possibility of solution that I've called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
From the desire that brought us to the incarceration.
It's what brings us in a stage.
It's what we're making a promise that we're saying.
We don't see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
And only you can tell yourself if you didn't count, she would lose.
"So?
The nurse's foundation?
I don't know.
The situation.
There's another.
It's very important.
It's the evolution, it's also been said today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I ask a friend, "Wow, give a space."
Is there an alternative Nobel Prize and an economy?
From developing country, Max, Niffe, Chilean.
When I met my dulce, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know who the human being was disturbing from other species.
Intelligence, no, language, no, it's culture, it's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father, that very respected world of his father said.
Isn't it stupid?
He assisted a little light, he said he became the first stupid.
The stupidology is a science that we need to study.
It differentiates itself, for example, of imbecility.
Audience: Yes.
which is absolutely...
Audience: Yes.
And one day, I like to remember the slower, the creator of violence, a big brother, and he told us that it's necessary to be a hypotalamic idiot, to be a good animal, on earths for the fourth, which is cerebral.
The question is stupid, because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly.
Rational.
To have diplomas and qualified universities.
And to do as a person who is talking about graphs, sophisticated developments, like a person sitting in the garbage of a tree, closing.
"So."
Next, he also said.
That for him only had it.
Two things are infinite.
The universe in human stupidity.
And she grew up, Einstein.
With relation to the universe, I still have the same.
But I need to say that I discourse.
They're pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the north museum, of Einstein and Max nephing, and considering that human beings.
Isn't it your nature?
We were born to be, to cry, stupidity, on the contrary, to serve.
So ...
I prefer to think of a confusion.
That 201600 years ago said that what differentiates our species of other species is inaccabation, it's in complete, we don't born human beings.
And we do ourselves humans.
But a tartaruga is born, it's tired, you've seen it, and it's going to the sea, "We don't."
We are born inaccabated, that's why saying confuse, human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
School for Tarugas, or for Tana Juras?
Emotional intelligence is education, it's the perfection, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, cultivating the dimensions of the soul, the psychiatrist, developing emotional intelligence, which, since the 19th century, seems that it's only to develop a rational test, not to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concensional?
To develop consciousness of where to play the values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
He summarized like this.
Your long exist.
At the age of 15, I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
It's 40.
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
Or 50?
And I knew what the fears of the sky were.
When I was obsessed, I listened to Douro's invitation.
At the 70s, I could follow the indications of my own heart because what I wanted, no longer that day, the borders of justice.
Is the same as the European therapists in Alexandria?
Two thousand years ago, you exchange clothes in five minutes, take a whole existence to exchange color.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The nurse refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be human beings.
Now, the opposite case, the question was: Is there 21st century?
The third world.
It's nothing less than this against this game.
In the future.
The new ones.
Geras.
So ...
The norm is terrible, because it's not insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.

Has anyone asked?
"Try."
Think about God.
And the IT.
I cried.
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a monastery in the big wine.
It's flowing.
What about human beings?
What potentially?
I'm.
"So?
"I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to doesn't happen.

A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let it flow."
That took a source, a water drop, and played in the fire's nest, and it was resiliently turning the other drop.
He played in the middle of the fire, and he came back with patience.
Houses ... frozen.
What a hammer?
I'd throw it in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, see, flow?"
Do you think that with these little ridiculous, are you going to turn off this infernal fire?
And I said, "I know it's not.
We listen to everything.
Now, I'm doing it.
In my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary, people who want to change the world of society.
Even with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way, because there are hundreds of people who are transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little order, a little.
What about love?
In this little pedacy of the world that the big world confies each one of us, and if we don't do this, where could we be transforming facilitators?
That's why revolutions.
And failed, and I keep failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
It means breathing, consent, right?
I manage with others, with others, with the world and with mystery.
I recommend a book: "The Korean Corean of Berlin Fex."
He studied a lot, these spontaneous, institutional movements, from a giant narrative.
"Beja Flow" has no ideology, he doesn't have flags, he's not cutting anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stay standing.
And we can do our part, by the way.
From the morning, I'm seeing beija-flores who came.
Each one, talking about their water, had water.
And all of you who are in this room?
That's it.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you're in this stage, but in stage, there's your life story.
Tell your story.
And taking it?
Your drop had water, because we can always assemble a candle.
Instead of just complaining.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
It's time.
of renown.
I love it.
That's it.
I grew up.
We read it.
Love with passive and poetry.
Still saving the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of Cecilia.
Let's see.
Renova.
It's born enthusiasm.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multiply has arms to scenarios everything.
Stories, who have seen it.
I created others.
For other visions.
Destrones, arms?
What's being scared?
For you to forget.
I'm sorry.
Being always the same.
Always the other.
It's easier.
Alto.
It's always far.
And inside.
That's it.
Between a good school.
The decoration.
I took good grades, no.
choose the profession that will define you for the rest of your life, while you're still a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, a publicitarian, or a market, since my mother has angry.
I chose a recovery of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the least effort.
Remember a channel.
Imagine a multinational company not recognized by their family.
Be three months.
I work twelve hours a day, exhausted until the limit of your strength.
To be obvious, your tired needs to be cruel.
Let's make interminable meetings, video games that don't take anywhere, show that you're important for structure.
More than working, it's important to appear and it's always producing.
It's seen the shirt.
Carre a six flexible point.
And there's someone in love, innoivated, married.
And he, "My boy, put him."
It scaves the corporate pyramid.
Vista, shirt, lamboths.
The job exchange.
Be the manager, the car of the firm.
Keep offraid and happy.
Happiness at the time marked?
Three bad cuts and shoes.
Vista, shirt.
Luke is the first apartment.
There's a child.
After two years, your second child is to listen.
(Laughter) Strange the car, year, no.
It buys an apartment and suffers 180 payments.
That first case is extra-conjugal with an interesting person in marketing.
Disney, two years later, every seven days in Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami.
More meetings that don't take anywhere, completely disqualified people being promoted before you.
The project that start and dismorate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of change, the void that countries in the mall in the weekends can't apply anymore.
The discharge is a pleasure antenna that if it goes so soon, the market lake is broken, seen the shirt.
The baby socially drinks every day.
The first apartment I was in the beach, the elite, the antidepressants, the void.
The middle crisis, the encounter with college colleagues, my God, as the years went fast, life is short.
My children in school, my gods, as they grew fast, are life hidden.
Let's be very cut by alphabets of the center, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the end of the weekend, at the end of the weekend, we'll sell the apartment of the beach, children grew up and don't even want to go to the shirt anymore.
The external thing is a little high, its classic body, as an astronaut here spent years, producing zero gravity.
(Laughter) None car, on account of the healthy habit of passing the file inside, puts all the infections.
Blue has faith, fried lactose, sugar, planting semester of the academic that you used for two months, today is fourth, day of ugly, hamburgers of fingers after being tired in the film, they took a project because life is too short to eat the fast.
The vice-president that, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, probably will never get there.
The continuous fear of losing a job today doesn't value the most experience, the fear of everything, the new generations, the change, the new one.
Because, in my time, a continuous legend that prevents you from living, fear of death, a smell of suffocation, a smell, otherwise I'm not focused.
The complete disconnection with your children is decorative of 12 hours of work decades.
The empty retirement surrounded by useless things and little affection.
AC: You're a winner, this is your only console.
I'm an executive life.
Vist the shirt, the wood.
Thank you very much.
