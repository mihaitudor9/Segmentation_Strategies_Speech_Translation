Did you find it?
Power and fragility.
And some of you will be wondering what they have to do, these two words apparently so far: you have to know that, until a few years ago, my two larger children, Mars and Francesca, and to sleep, they chose two words, and I had to tell a story.
But now this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon, so the story begins with the only child: the boys, the words, made them go out, just stayed blocked in their mouth.
Anyway, the years pass, the child becomes a young man, but he suffers a lot about this problem of bubbles, it's so much that he proves to find psychologists, all the great people, great professionals, but nobody can choose this uncertainty.
One day, he does a trip to Rome, and so, fortunately, he finds a little old girl called Calcutta.
And this old girl says to the young man, "When one day you'll wait for a child, whatever happens?"
Not to be afraid.
It's so much that everyone around the Earth's mother, but what beautiful words of freedom, but what's the ...
The boy thought, "I'm not interested.
To these words of freedom, I want freedom for my words.
Anyway.
They spent years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor, and he became an informatic engineer.
Because it was much easier to digitalize words in front of a computer.
That it's to recite words in front of a audience.
But a good day, in the pity of his country, they were adding a big party with a scenery and a microphone there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
(Laughter) That's exactly how people laughed, but the desire of this young man to try the battles he had written, the comic battles were too big, and he didn't think, he left the chestnut, and he was happy because my first words were fluid in the water, but he was successful in that moment.
So, at this point, one of my daughters would ask me, "Yes, Dad, we understood that you're you."
(Laughter) And then, even if you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say, "The Egocentric father would say the mom."
But the power comes to us, but I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, my debilities.
And something very strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more kind, or worked, and then, all the people I've met and who have become a volunteer in a house that opens people with disabilities, have shown out and are really taking the best of me, and this is wonderful.
But that's it.
Like in all the stories that are respected.
There's always a difficult moment, a bubble moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can make a bit of fear, and then the scene changes, and then we go to the Civil Hospital of Padova, we are invited to my wife who is in Cinta, a doctor who makes us bother my wife, or is becoming a father.
It takes the paper and read trisomy 21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one I have in my ears are the words of that warming.
"Dombia Freite."
But the genius body is my wife, who says, "Yes, Doctors know, but our son is a mask and a female," (Laughter) the doctor says, "Scuse, maybe she didn't understand, sadness is 21, it's the Down syndrome."
It's a feminine: I've understood a lot, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female, the doctor is always more spontaneous, close, and we're not even able to do the mask of snow, but it's summer!
(Laughter) Doctors gave the seed to the doctor.
That's it.
(Applause)
(Applause) Thank you.
We talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was, of course, a very difficult moment, maybe the hardest of our life, but I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, even after a few months, it's beautiful, it's also strong!
It's a bit part of me, you've understood it, and even the best thing they've brought in our families, the wonderful thing is that it has made us all the best people, it's better to me, my wife, the best, and all the people we find in some way, and if it's not power to this.
But then we've done this cardboard where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you're from one thing, because if we talk about Down syndrome, we're all the hundreds of analyses, we know everything, but very few of these people have had very little information from the technical point of view, with disability, and then you've decided to open a small X.
Audience: Yes.
No, why do I give you this example?
(Applause) Because you, today, to know TED, to talk to TED, to talk to people, have done a bit of practice, so the invitation is to make a little of facts, and don't avoid the encounters of disability that you'll have in your life, either personal, but also of the people around you, a little recommendation.
In this journey, we can lose ourselves, because our tendency is always the ones to put a gradually on me, a gradually below: here, to look at the eyes, you have to put yourself in the same level, and in this sense, it's always the same with this segment.
That in the language of segments is the word "disability," so you don't want to try to look for disabled traits in your life, to take them, and above all.
And remember that the fears you were able to look at in the face are transformed into courage, thanks to the heart of truth.
I thought that to make the revolution, I'd like to be a particular character, a kind of mouse that goes to Gandhi, and maybe many of you could go well, because it was thanks to a soccer, so I think it's very fortunate, but for an orchestra, it's what happened to me a be, just thanks to a heartbeat, and what happened to me.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would have been my mission in the world, wouldn't be able to fail anymore.
And trying to make the world a little more sustainable, starting from food.
Because it's food, and not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact, because our choices, for us, for our family, every single day, and maybe, try to change something, to start a small revolution if possible.
And it's very simple, rather, it's something good sense, and it's to optimize, I'll say that almost a word that refers to domestic economy, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our relationship with food.
And the concept of consumption, optimizing consumption, is especially the way we compose the tattoo every day, the tattoo, so what do we effectively take to the table?
The scars, I'm part of this project, so from the encounter with the fire, just from the end of the file, from the rejections, from what we usually use every day at home, when we pull the wounds, and to separate them from one part, there's the noble part, that we use and on one side there's the scarce.
The scarce, so the less noble part is, in average, at least 50% of the raw materials, so what does it mean to optimize in the kitchen means to have a different approach, to see all these parts as only together, we do an example with the mum, I can also see it as a group of four ingredients, for example, the dust.
