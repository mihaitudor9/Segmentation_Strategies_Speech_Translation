(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed.
In the way they treat their children.
But in Brazil?
We're seeing paradoxes.
Our children are what we have the most precious.
We want the well-being to any cost, to give them our lives, and, however, ...
Our children are being very badly treated for society.
Actually, this demands a reflection.
And it requires us to change, and that's what I hope to do a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what is most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we're a terrible character, because we deny basic rights such as health, housing, food.
We treat them with violence.
And if they rebel themselves?
We offer her prison.
But even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and children of you who are here.
Things don't go well, we commit, maybe, not smaller crimes.
I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is starting against childhood.
What are we going to take?
The wave of Gabriela, a child from middle class, typical.
Starting with your pregnancy, you can understand.
These hands.
The mother of Gabriela?
Do you want it?
There's a natural birth.
At that moment of link, affection with your daughter, receiving, along with her husband.
This baby will be born?
She then begins to go to Navidad, and, quickly, the hospital doctor's industry convinced that I'm better for her is Cesare.
It's a highly lying argument, but it's very convincing, so convincing.
That produces the culture of the Cesai, a culture that makes women believe that the normal birth must be necessary, that the birth...
It's normal, it's harmful, dangerous, painful.
It generates a verbal statistics in our country.
Ninety and three percent of births in the private network, for example, Rio de Janeiro, 93%.
I'm made by Cesariana.
Between 15 to 20% of the 20% of the country.
This generates huge benefits for children, and this makes us lose this moment of love.
It replaces a medical, surgical act, with a woman adopted.
It's immobilized, of course it can be humanized, it can be well made, but certainly it won't be the same benefits in a normal part. Remember that, of course, there are cesaries for each of these peculiaries we're going to be.
We are criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me, the same way happens with a mother's milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But I've already left maternity.
One of the many pediatrists who can be there.
It's working, it's going to be true here, you can take a wood, a little formula, in favor of her case, she needs hunger.
She goes home more insecure, gets home, the grandmother, her mother, and you, grew up with a flag, "What a business, are you alive, are you strong?"
The child is crying, the ear is weak, in two months, this child is dismantled, and she loses marvels that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement.
To the consumer, but it does the advertisement for the names it gives to the forms: award!
Experprou?
Spread!
The maternal milk, the entrance, it's a lover.
But he just comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industries do the advertisement with the doctor, they do the doctor, their marriage.
Conventional people in their homes.
Happiness in the professionals saying that they do the development of the baby.
And it was sponsoring with a lot of prizes and dinner and congresses, and integrally sponsoring medical societies.
It's a matter of pediatric sympathetic that ends unconsciously being one of the biggest cases of basic siblings.
In this way, we'll lose.
The privileges are not a meditation, and ...
It's improving, through the first peculiar, that the privation of the natural birth of the maternal leiting, serious health problems in children, in mothers, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovering now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will end up in essence, she'll go to the church, because the grandmother can't take care of it.
She'll spend six or eight or ten hours in an institution.
You'll get home, your parents are regretted with tired of tickets, a tongue full of tickets, and they'll live little with your daughter.
There's still work to do at home, right?
In the weekends, are they going to walk?
They'll take the shell in post-herrababá, because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens is that we lose what is more precious in childhood, with the video.
Our children.
We often regret with their adolescence, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their lives.
The coexistence is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing someone deeply.
Are you at home with this person?
These are our precious children, and we're losing this because of the terrible peculiarization of childhood.
Gabriel's parents can't cook, they don't have time, they don't have money to pay employees, they'll give what the media tells us to give food, frozen, industrialized food.
Does supermarkets choose their brilliant sheets?
They end up exchanging, we ended up exchanging the Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy.
For a rich food.
In fat, saturated fature.
enormous salt and sugar accesss.
Before, Molinhas, inside, all the weapons that industry, through food engineering, are highly developed.
What do you do?
For children to be completely addicted.
Communication is destroyed and, in this way, unable to eat healthy food.
They can't.
It's not because they're annoying.
What about it?
This leads serious problems, like diabetes obesity that are exploded in childhood.
Even if we want to give food, that we can give healthy food to our children, it's no longer healthy, because it's sold to agrotoxes, and we're worldwide consumption of agrotóxes.
Intoxication in childhood that also leads serious problems.
Gabriela goes to a tiny crew, which has cables, for four months, and someone knows that it's highly negative to the involvement of a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run to play out there.
However, our urban life doesn't allow it to do this, people are afraid to leave children leave, they stay home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they block me and don't want this entire world.
These children spend eight.
Folks, this is static.
Eight to ten connected hours with your devices today.
Again, connected with the game device, it's great, but not eight hours followed, children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, this is increasingly agraving.
I remember when I traveled cars with my children, we played, it was an incredible moment.
And as a child, it's a wonderful thing: we'd play Dedanha, who'd play Dedanha here, from school and trap, right?
We played people's game, and at the moment of living family and humor of risks, things that stay in the memory of us in childhood.
We looked at the window, saw the landscape passing, in the form of meditation.
So today, it's two sides and two states for each one, if it can't do things in the car.
Even in moments, this exists, guys.
Even in moments, where the child needs more, this exists, this comes from the weapons, you can go there.
Impinic, the hypothesis.
This is the name, Hipporn.
I still come with a layer to cover the table of successful women in a packaging look, right?
Even in the moments she needs the most awareness, that's what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive.
This makes us trust our children.
And, asking them to have a moment of consciousness, of void.
Tedio?
The fundamental TED is, in childhood, because the void is a berce of what is most important for us: creativity and imagination.
And we're pushing this from our children.
With this peculiar confinement and permanent distraction.
Gabriela sets four hours of television per day.
It's massacred by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it's spent the last four hours, and it's spent more time on television.
Americans were in record because we have less time in school.
Then, in the weekends, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program of the Brazilian family in the week, which is "O."
OK, but it will be massacred by advertising, by consumer values.
This university is a COVARD organization.
The probability that they explore their ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
They explore the love of it for characters, doing what they do.
Do you fall in love with toxic products, toys, cars, and brands, inclusion of love?
And who instills values as an obsessive consumption.
The hyper-realization of appearance.
Futility and worse things.
What's going to disagree?
In obesity, it's going to disagree, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that the beer in Brazil is not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind it.
Obviously, those who need more friendships are teenagers, and they are profoundly affected by commercials and alcoholism in adolescence is growing scary.
This is the effect of childhood mercantilization and child consumption.
Gabriela stays with the crowded moon of commitment because her parents want her competitive, an adult of a lot of success.
And your agenda is full of compromises.
To relax this stress, those increasingly increase the classroom of meditation.
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing, "Who hasn't meditated in the balance?"
Look at the sky.
Look at the floor.
Look at you.
There's no beautiful meditation than this one.
"Let's spend money with another class, and then it'll be exposed to this."
The type of erotization that our society proposes, "Merrodization."
Who uses seven-year-old children to sell products?
It's fashion.
The firstization based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse.
In the dissociation of sexuality.
The love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their heads completely when we've got eight or ten years old.
This is the worst of the end of the childhood and the early erotization.
Is Gabriela?
There are parents who are afraid of it, because they don't live with it.
So, instead of limits, they put them in a trunk.
She goes to be the queen of the family and not the member of the family, she goes to decide the programs, the cardboard, if she goes to the school, the school's fault, we have to talk to a teacher.
She earns many presents when she needed, it would be presence.
She realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, and sometimes with two or three years old, who think parents don't have authority, she's very handsome.
It's insecure, it needs people who lead her life.
This generates taste and generates symptoms.
We know that the importance of limits and not are fundamental ways of love, we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability instead of that.
We're doing what Americans are not Helicopstrapianting.
We interrupt ourselves between children's experiences and the world.
But I don't know that they don't have the experience of life, so they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration, with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver them later, this is the peculiar.
Under the under-preadization of the childhood.
In front of so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelde.
Brigona, Birenta, going to be sick, going to eat too much, staying weight, going bad in school, it doesn't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about this.
It's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these children.
The poor people put it on their chair.
"What's the year?"
The solution we're not going to give to bad-comported children is not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, no, medicalization, we're going to give medicine, be ready for them to behave well.
This is called medicalization and it's the worst fish.
Kin, from Mafalda, says this: "Take a wonderful manner," he tells the story of a city.
It's polluted by a factory that's terribly polluted, people spending bad because of furniture.
They go to the doctor, see they're sick, they receive medicine, they go home.
They buy a remedy in the pharmacy.
That shows us here, in fact.
What the slum that is producing is exactly the medicine.
Isn't it?
And that's what we're doing with our children, not only with the elastic children, adults, also in an overwhelming way.
Medicalization of the most "dereteas" phenomena.
You see that in the United States, 15% of children today are willing to open this competitive and individualist society.
The three colors are the market that grows the most for depressed.
Let's get to this point.
Ritaline, the medical background, which is for tension and hyperactivity disorder.
It sold in 1999, 70,000 boxes.
In 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
This isn't the epidemic of disease, this is a massacre against childhood.
We're going back.
"Normalizing."
And asking for children to be themselves.
I'm sure some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, had today at school.
He would be exactly this: rotated, non-marketized.
We will have held on its genius and have lost that of wonderful partnership.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need better solutions, to change the paths.
The problems are very complex, I don't see them without fishing, and factors that highlight each other.
But for the whole problem, complex of humanity.
There's always a solution.
Simple, easy.
Invariably wrong.
It's obvious.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
It's what we reflect on this: a solution well, a TEDx assistance, I'm sure I'm already going through my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time.
And space, but nothing.
Is it just a time?
What can we do?
When we talk about cats, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today.
It means smoking, almost all the churchs.
Digitalism is to give a part of what we have most precious to our childhood, our children, which are our sacred.
What do we have more precious today?
Our capital.
The most important thing is time.
Time?
We have 17 hours of vigilance.
It's 1.7 hours we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This gives a lot of 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just to priorize.
If we don't give up in the weekends, we start with one in the weekends, it's possible to live our children's time.
In relation to space.
I'd like to propose an exercise for you.
15 seconds.
Let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you to trust, close your eyes for 15 seconds.
I imagine a healthy place.
A healthy city, a sea, healthy, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health and quality of life.
It was a good place to live.
See this place.
How would he be?
Look at your eyes.
They tell me if you fit yourself in this statement.
Isn't it?
I'm sure most of you, yes.
This shows the importance of nature between us; nature is profoundly associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul.
We know what makes us healthy, it's not the hospital doctor, the medicine, these factors, we all know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience.
I started with the pattern behind, when I was delivering my presentation, and she said, "Gee, but you've talked about something incredible.
I talked about the convergence of sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment.
Everything that does good health does well the environment and vice versa.
If you send a bike, make a body, my cities, the bodies, the pollution, the collective transport does well.
The time of coexistence, reduces stress, reduces pollution.
With my organic, who goes to the body, does well to the rivers, does it come to the Earth, see the animals.
Things always retreat themselves in a positive way, creating always vicious.
And I live with nature properly said, with an open space, what does he do?
Look how wonderful it is!
It will harm us from the fabrics, it will give us a moment of awareness for children, to reduce the consumption of an excessive material.
He'll promote the book to play, which will generate intelligence, humor, imagination, creativity.
It will generate living among families, with love.
The IBGRA lives between children, different children who will know each other.
I wanted to learn how to deal with them.
Mom developed empathy, it's going to promote the contact with the tree, and the green that produces well-being physical, well-being psychic, mental.
It's going to reduce all the problems of childhood, it's scientific, it's not what I'm talking about, it's all that demonstrate that it's.
Obesity and creativity and aggressiveness improve immunity, the better socialization and escolarity, in a marvelous life.
It takes children to nature.
And when I say "levate those who don't speak" we're not talking about spaces when boys with fat spaces, trust, and now we're going to have a big space, no, we're talking before with domination.
We're talking about dying the wall.
And to embrace cities.
And playing in the squares, occupying public spaces.
Committing chairs with love, affection, with coexistence.
There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this, and not only the initiative of physical use has been reinvented by public policies that facilitate us in contact with public space and nature, that promote psychology.
Eventures of free spaces, Brian urbanization, gardens in schools, gardens in the city, public transport to take these places, safety.
A accessible and careful square squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, and the word occupies practically.
I used for citizen resistance today.
This means occupying public space with joy.
What about it?
especially participate in the city's governance.
The governance of the city is what makes the difference between catastrophs, as São Paulo happened.
You're seeing here in a picture of Billings, a source of São Paulo water 30 or 40 years ago.
And today?
Is it a governance magician?
And cities that have quality of life?
Because they have participation.
Have you come back and people demand?
Imagine the publics returned to the public interest, with their sustainability, with equity.
With transparency and payment of bills, there are many movements in Brazil starting to do this.
Even here in Porto Alegre.
It's cool to participate in this.
To conclude, the same scientists, who announced it.
A terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, will be very early.
"Are the kids going to take me full?"
They also say, 97% of scientific consensus, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis.
Reducing inequality from social perspective and from the environmental point of view, of course, doing everything we already know, right?
Actually, by sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing energy pattern.
And taking the children outside, taking the kids to the square, to the water.
To the invitation, to empathy, we'll learn to take care of others and reduce inequality.
We're going to make them love and nature because they're only experimenting.
The ice cream, not seeing in YouTube, is that we learn to love this dog and defend it in the future, because we only defend what we love.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children, already outside.
Familia is already outside.
Let's take care of the public spaces with the game, with a joke.
With entertainment, participation.
That's it, and since we're talking about utopia, I'm often showing myself a quote by Eduardo Galiano, who left us ...
This year, unfortunately.
He said that utopia is in the horizon.
The more I get closer, the more it affects, if it approacts 1,000 steps, it affects 1,000 steps.
What is utopia good for?
Exactly to make us walk.
It doesn't make us walk outside (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2007, ...
I came across a big group of young people and adults.
With disability.
They are excluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
To look and see the many efficiencies.
From these people?
They are marked by their deficiencies.
So I created the therapeutic coffee project.
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a really inclusive society?
To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school.
It's more advice.
And with each other, I thought.
People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
They can see many things they can do.
In this project, they present this.
What do you do?
For the community and for society in general.
People with disability.
Sometimes they're left aside.
Let me have friends.
It's about thinking they're not able.
To have friendships.
To feel like acting with people.
Take the case of the Igor's student, for example.
What in the other school did he study?
For four years, he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
People didn't make an effort for that too.
So, throughout four years.
He stayed in the block.
I'm taking part in all physical education classes.
How he loved running.
He was running all the time.
arriving at the Olympic Camp.
I looked for knowing the Igor in a global way.
That's why I knew what he liked to do.
What interests him in school?
And what would we do together?
For him to be able.
They achieved better learning.
The school?
It was a place for Igor.
From despair.
Well, isn't it that it's a pull?
Today, it's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
He has many friends, he says I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on his parents' Day.
I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
Can you teach the student?
To enjoy.
It's your own learning.
All of them think.
That they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
I need to use it.
And believe it.
And they are capable.
And it's this kind of child.
In school?
To do good for them.
It's going to do good for other students.
For school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities.
The other's usual.
Why do you choose this way?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know.
And there's what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my look.
Or living with people?
Can you see it?
I learned.
I say that.
My shooting?
They don't live with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
Or those who can't walk.
And I learned to value my ideas.
Or those who have many times.
There are difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned ...
It was the value of my heart.
And the heart of my students.
To create connections.
And friendship laps.
And the most important thing for society?
It's learning.
It's an exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers)
Good evening.
(Audience) Yes.
I've always liked it a lot.
I had to eat.
But I've never been to cook.
When I was little, I loved seeing my grandmother.
Cozinana.
She'd cook, work in the kitchen, she'd take account.
The Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa ...
She did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hands in front of her, in fact, was my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen.
And this is the answer.
What I want to give to you today.
Because if there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
Then something transformed me, transformed my life completely.
I give my view of the world.
It changed my diet.
How is it?
I started to realize that ...
And I did.
The food had ...
The power, let's say this.
And I also decided...
I studied food philosophies that could use.
The food as a form of prevention.
It's cure and treatment of diseases.
How does remedy form?
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young people.
It's the Cuidated zelo and respect for nature.
So I decided we could...
It's the way we give.
It builds the food system.
Through food.
And what did I do?
I believe...
One of the side effects of modernization ...
It's the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life.
I don't believe it's us.
"Process."
It's a little...
In life?
In rural, in the city, we can strengthen the bonds.
Between men and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way we can do it.
It's to connect with nature.
What about it?
A few years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside.
And there, I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
food, food.
Like a tool, not only to improve quality of life in health terms.
It's also improving, using a tool.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
With this, we need to change.
It's to get it.
Reestructuring the food system.
Does the dynamic give?
It's food.
From production?
Distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example.
From the production process of meat, for example.
There are two principles that conduct.
The production of meat in industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed.
How much more?
What does it produce?
The more cheap it is.
And it produces.
The worst is quality.
What about it?
Most of the cost for the environment and for our health, in terms of speed.
The cycle of the animal is artificially accelerated the cycle of life of the animal.
It's artificially accelerated and...
Eli ...
He begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies ...
"Yeah...
It's time when it's not winning.
And he begins to lose, to decrease dramatically.
Your quality of life.
It's your health and your life time.
Isn't it?
I believe we ...
It can and must change this system.
I was the other day passing to the supermarket of this food system.
He realized.
That the kilo of Franco was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can it be?"
This is very complex because how can it cost so little?
You create an animal.
From birth to abat.
This didn't enter my head.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables.
The production process, right?
In industrial scale?
It's also a long time.
We say this harmful for our lives, for our health, and for the environment.
Nowadays, Brazil is the biggest agrotoxic consumer in the world.
Each Brazilian consumes, on average, 5 kg of agro toxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
And I believe people, you know?
The benefits of agrotoxic.
But even so.
They keep polluting.
"Beautiful."
In the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why.
But the answer ...
And our current society?
There are inverted values, there's an investment of values.
Why does a person worry?
And not buying a perfume, false, because you think it's going.
There's any alergic reaction because you don't know the procedure, you don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal.
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values, and we need to teach people.
To value organic products, because when you buy, for example, a mass of alphace.
It's an organic officer, you're paying, not only...
You're investing in your health, but you're paying for the well-being of the producer.
It's something people don't go, instead of being born many times, you don't know.
That behind that alphace there was someone who cared with all love and affection.
He took this leap to you.
So we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why it works.
I said, "Wow!
I think I fell in love with it.
And by the culinary and by nutrition.
In terms of distribution?
It's also not efficient.
I think it's...
You must know that we produce a lot of food.
It's the third of the food we produce.
It's simply desperate, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why it's passionate about hunger, and the reason is still in people.
It's a map of distribution, we have to reveal this.
In terms of consumption?
Also ...
It's the way we...
I take the foods today, it's scary, my grandmother is a paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
If I got it, put it on.
The middle of the Paulista Avenue.
I'm sure it's very scared.
By reading those executives or those appealed people?
Starting on the street, talking on the cell phone, swallowing a piece of pizza, for example, because getting hurt is something people, many people think it's losing time.
I think it's true.
It's very important.
So, she'd go, anyway.
It's almost a fifth.
But because it doesn't recognize that as a way of thinking, as a way of feeding itself.
And it's...
So ...
These Food Foods, these quick foods, were made in the same way, to be able to eat together with another activity, or talking about cell phone, clapping, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society.
We end up opening space to the street, which is very good.
It's very harmful, very harmful for our health.
So we need to reverse.
A way we consume food.
And these little whiskers, and so on, also have many chemical adjectives.
And an exaggerated level of sugar salt, which are the three centuries.
This is what I found before, right?
And, mainly, the savor reassers?
They end up destroying our paladar.
They degenerate our nervous system.
They end up creating a dependency not only in physics.
But it's also a mental dependency, a psychological dependency.
It's a physiological dependency.
In other words, industrialized products in excess are very harmful.
I don't even call them food, for me, they're food measures of food because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes panels pipoca?
Pocks of panels in the microphone place.
"Look at the microwaves."
Metade half... (Laughter) Who here still makes a cake?
Instead of buying that little package cake.
Hi, my afternoon, thank you.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the question.
These two questions may seem unnoffensive.
"No, I don't want to."
I don't say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, just to change you.
Pocks of panels, of microwaves.
You're already causing a damage.
For your health, because you'll...
It's consuming.
Chemistries you wouldn't put, I'm sure you're absolute.
I'm Poca de Panela's topic.
And you're also polluting with the packaging of microwaves, it's a packaging that could...
It's to be a less trash in the world.
So, I think that consumption ...
It's excessive to produce industrialized, it's a lot.
"I'm a judicial."
That's it.
So ...
To talk.
"Yeah ...
To summarize?
And this is the question of the process.
In food production, I think...
It's very difficult.
This dynamic feeds this food system.
It's not easy.
That's it.
It's not working, and we must change, but how to change?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
To cook.
This name of art, culture, pleasure, health.
Putting back independence, bringing higher.
self-knowledge brings autonomy.
It brings safety, freedom.
To cook is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry, (Laughter) because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes.
So, if you leave...
The industry is to feed you.
It's...
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner.
Isn't it like a spider?
Bata Frita, hamburg, street dog.
What is a pizza?
(Laughter) And it's a disquipizza, because not even Pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we're ...
I said, "Oh...
"No, that's it."
Each rice is the feijon, broken the rice of each day.
It filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are many people who don't have interest, who don't have a price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very workable, very anti-pratic, is loss of time.
But, for example, if you let a sheet of paper at night a day, wake up in the morning.
And then...
In 20 minutes, you have a ready in the pressure panel.
How can you simply take a day and make the kiss?
Let's leave frozen for the rest of the week.
Together with the street, do you do 20 or 30 minutes?
More the legumes you've already cut and launched in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and, half an hour, you have the ready reflection.
This would be maybe at the same time.
What would you take to wait for the pizza to get there?
Experal of Pizza's book.
Isn't it?
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, how we see the act of cooking.
Everyone can.
It must cook.
Men, woman.
A boy, a girl.
Children, adults.
Doubted.
There's no ...
You don't have sex.
There's no gender.
Everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children to take the children to the fair to choose the vegetables that will have to dinner.
It's putting children to dedicate a battle, the value.
Simple things in our daily lives.
We can...
These children will grow, build a better future.
A holistic view of the world will know where food comes from.
We think it's from the supermarket shelter.
So, children go...
To grow independent of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow dependent on the industry.
It's pharmaceutic because they'll be pharmaceutic.
Very less sick.
Being eating a wedding food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to...
That's it.
Dynamics.
In food, we have to change.
What is our...
I said, "Oh, yes."
Our value ...
I'm going to talk about it for...
We have food, we have to value the food, value the act more.
Do you want to eat?
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to give birth.
Education.
It doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food.
This has less hospitals, yes.
It's education.
Education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food?
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing.
There are foods.
They are choices we can do.
To change the world better.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Life is not the one we live in.
But it's the one we remember and how we remember to tell.
Are you here in the background?
To talk about the transforming power of stories?
It's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family are here.
I came here when I was a child.
I spend the vacation with my cousins, my brothers.
And also to family parties.
My grandmother, Mario Güeyuça.
It was the first tribe planter.
The work is the Brazilian mechanism.
Here in the lands of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother, Tília.
They had seven children, inside them in my mother.
She got married with my father.
After having felt my five siblings.
I got to this world.
Personally.
It was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell.
What makes us be who we are.
And by telling them, we transform ourselves.
Who listens to it?
It also transforms itself.
We want to transform ourselves, we want to change.
What else?
We are our story.
Before looking at this future?
We need to see.
That's where I come back and honor all stories.
My passion for stories started very early, I've always liked to write.
Could I read you?
In school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos."
He talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me live the mourning.
And I know he helped many people too.
So, have you used this and have told this story?
For me, it brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
What is the power that people can?
Keep welcomed in the other's history, they feel in the colo of each one's stories.
So it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because obviously it's someone.
"Dad."
I saw and felt welcomed in this story.
Then one day came, I met this whole world here.
TEDx knew incredible people all over the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds.
There are products.
I understood, at 45 years old, that I needed to change.
I needed to expand.
And I spent so ...
To help people tell their stories.
Because the world of advertising had already been very small for me.
So I started doing this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, I invited him to talk.
Two years ago, in TEDx.
Over.
Compreendedorism with purpose.
Things are so fashionable today.
But he brought me another challenge.
And she was talking about bubble.
Because that was what he always suffered.
And he wanted it.
Dividing the story with others.
And I left because I had to do with the subject.
But I throw you away.
How much did we prepare ourselves to talk about it?
He always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints.
A right?
I heard everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal to tell a story, to keep complaining who did that with us?
And if not, to inspire people ...
That they can embrace themselves, that they can assume who they are, as we already said here.
With no fear.
And he was understanding this, and he was changing the tone.
And, on the day, theater ...
Whether I'm on stage?
He transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time he was gay.
Absolutely.
He talked to a lot of property about bullying, acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful!
I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation, the one of the people I know who know him.
It's also to have seen that the wheelchair they imagined that Tiago had.
It wasn't anything more than a great defense.
They started to understand him better and he welcomed himself.
And just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story.
Many people!
The week went by, he sent me a choice in his story.
A car saying ...
That many boys have sought him, even more.
There's no way.
At the time, it's so expensive to dialogue and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story.
They wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told you.
His story.
And this hadn't assumed for people in a way.
I didn't have any shame.
So, telling stories to me ...
They provoke micro-revolutions in our lives.
"So?
They're many, not only in them, but also in my own, of everyone who goes through a TEDx.
We all have to hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
And for me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this at seven years old.
training many people to be here, right?
That's how it works.
But if there's no rule?
There's no tip about how to start, about asking a question to the audience.
"Ah!
Is there something funny?
It shows the picture of your children.
But, in fact.
I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage.
Fort of heart.
about this.
I told the story of the "Ave," the "Ave," the teacher of the University is "Braica de Jeros além."
He researches listening.
We stayed for months.
He was preparing his speech in the TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day?
Two weeks before all.
His talk ...
I called him in the Skype and said, "Let's discover what's wrong with it."
Every time you talk to me?
Everything tells me, "It's all here."
That's all here.
And it shows me your head, how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here.
It has to be a heart.
And he changed everything.
And one day, he gave a incredible talk.
It opens the listening.
about the importance of listening to others, and how was the fact that he had been heard, when he needed the most, when he was a kid, when he had cancer.
What did he do with?
It was to study about this.
And it was him who taught me ...
And we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count.
There are so many addictions, oratory, and writing.
But who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Why did he tell me?
And we saw this today that, how much do we hear, really?
We change ourselves.
And we are afraid to transform ourselves.
We're afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we'll change, we'll change.
So we talk about change, but...
There's always this fear.
We always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
For us?
And for others.
And listening?
I also see, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy.
But we...
There's no minute.
To look at others?
To come and embrace and say.
Something.
We don't have time.
There are people.
Why are we worried?
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
That's it.
How can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
This, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx, but ...
MCM: And empathy?
There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most varied stories.
I don't know, outside all the others.
I said, "Oh!
I also learned that empathy is too.
When she taught me ...
"What? What?"
We need to look at the problem of street residents.
For example, when we say...
In the street.
Many of us have it.
We don't have anything to give.
When they ask us something?
We have yes.
We have at least a smile.
And he doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell, that make us be who we are.
And to listen to the other, really?
We transform ourselves.
What if the other?
And it counts, it also changes.
And in the midst of preparation, a fight that was the process here for me.
I was out of my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, helping people.
And the answer, for me?
All of us?
I came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To give her the key to your lives.
Fourth of the flaws, the rooms.
The values of the kitchen between uncertainty.
I wanted to free many people I know.
I went back to them to faith in life.
To faith?
In some humans, I wanted to free many of the people I know.
To say they have the right to change.
The right to cry.
The right to not love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Freedom of your story, which, although important, is not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people to know.
They were at least one minute of distance.
Then they could look to the side and come back to smiling.
Putting and listening.
What stories are you going to tell about your life?
Stories, you want them to count.
about you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is that on Earth I've been told that I don't belong to many spaces.
It's because, in fact, I'm part of the true step.
Or there are no judgments.
Where there are all kinds of stars.
And the stars don't pull labels or classifications.
They are belonging to their plural spaces.
There's no fat or thin, ugly and beautiful.
Rica is the poor.
They are only linked to existential existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while.
For a very dark phase that fell over my life.
A phase where it was denied to me.
The right to just be born.
However, resisting and always been my life condition for me, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman.
A woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her.
The moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect.
And the right for life.
And precisely because of that, I created this poem, because he does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars in the sky.
The universe is infinite.
And along with them, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, no one was covered or the beauty of the other.
So, why are we here below?
They're small, we can't reproduce something so simple.
It's acceptance.
Empathy.
To understand definitely that the difference is aggregated.
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal.
So that's why we have privilege.
And it's the opportunity to be different.
Different to Belo.
It's incredible when we feel with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, and this is rich, this exchange.
So I want to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself today to know something or someone different from you.
They allow themselves.
AC: Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand the other, it's important that we understand who we are first.
After starting my gender transition, I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be.
And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a capture ball.
It was where I could be the same.
It was where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body.
Or I questioned God, "Why to be different?"
Well, the bathroom turned into my best friend.
He was always there, after a full day of bullying.
Or when I wanted to put yourselves in my head and dance rebeldes, because I only repeated until today.
(Laughter)
But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me?
Or better, why do I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple.
The fact that I'm different.
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why?
From the lack of information.
And when it's about the trans universe, this path is even harder.
I researched the Internet, but I didn't see people like me.
I didn't even know what trans people were.
And, during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see traditional friends.
And that desire to grow inside me, I said, "Guys, I want to become an athlete."
I don't know.
Everyone becoming, so she thought and started in a wrong way.
It's to mirror me in the other.
So, during my artsenic graduation, I had the opportunity to know myself in front of me.
Theater showed a new world, it was a divisor of water in my life.
It was in theater that I learned to deal with the difference, with theater I learned to understand the other.
So I started looking for my true address, and I started to unleash.
It's as if you enter a blue, spend a while there, and this is a beautiful bubble.
However, this process has painful phases and that not everyone is standing to deal with.
It's difficult when you're in the middle of an overcoming of changes.
And you still have to learn to deal with the non-acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world.
What if you are a black woman?
It's fat.
This path is even harder.
We go through many daily tests.
In the case of us, for example, people think it's just a phase.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people.
Something that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come, are you transmitted, our new thing, there's no traffic face?"
No, this is easy, it's going to happen.
Folks, who are consciousness and chooses that life expectancy of 35 years?
It's a crazy person here who wants to see Thaustín Tecinco.
While men have their life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are consciousness, choosing and living in the country that kills trans people?
In the whole world.
I wouldn't choose that.
I said, "So?
They question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the National Association of transvestite women.
He said that we, transgender women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed.
Second, we compared with the United States, for example, to 144 people who were killed here in Brazil in 2016.
Paces, 21 deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have up to nine times more chances of dying with the risk of belief and violence.
Being trans isn't an option.
But in a life condition.
There's a magic formula, where there's a wheelchair and motorcycle, resistance, expectation of 35 years, there's no, those who may be like this, that we could mediate the best panel.
But it's not.
I could stay here in the whole afternoon, explaining to you how I brought my life story.
However, each one of us is the protagonist of their own story.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
I'm depending on ourselves, for example, I'm the proof of this.
After I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence.
I started to use my ...
My art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish about me.
I grew up in YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people, not only trans people, I became a model, a magazine, a "J" and "perform" and YouTube, and in an impressor in which I exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(Audience talking) It's more responsibility (Applause)
It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about differences for so many people.
To represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went from my own name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that come out of me on the Internet, talk about it.
They were comments carried, like macho, capable.
"M monster, you'll never be a woman, die."
What has no price?
(Audience) Yes!
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
What has no price?
It's this message of mothers.
And other trans girls.
I'm degrading.
To teach them more than their own daughter.
The best is to receive a message of other trans mines with brilliant eyes.
I thank myself.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world.
But today I also understand that I don't want to be just sad.
But I'm a small part of what I am.
I'm far beyond that.
I'm far beyond it.
But to understand this, I have a place of knowledge, I really need to understand that we are many.
We are plural beings, the agreek difference.
The sky?
I refuse from being isolated.
Tell me.
It will be a side.
In the middle of the blue.
Freedom without limits.
I and the sky.
"Your and me?"
Not more looks.
I don't ask myself to stop, I've already delivered myself from my corridors.
So, what remains are scars.
That marked my soul.
But the future.
And the future promises.
That's what I want.
A cell phone, now I'm, now I'll fly, I'll fly, thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, technology and information.
Together, I did work with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
I spent many years doing this and accompanying children.
And even with all my knowledge, about communication, I couldn't explain to children what cancer was.
What is in treatment, protocols, procedures?
They knew that I had a ovarium system that doctors called "theractoma."
One beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly to take the tumor, won't you take a sixth?"
Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate.
I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point.
Nothing.
And it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure.
I woke up ten hours later and I noted.
At the same time, I stayed with children with cancer.
I looked down, full of tubes and connections.
And ...
The belly is all mixed.
I called my nurse and asked, "Are you cancer?"
She said, "Yes."
So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's outside the visite time."
And then I asked her to handle me.
Until I slept.
I woke up only after the room.
I used cancer, metástasis, and committed gangs.
I'd say to children, "Don't give Google."
And after all, ... (Laughter)
It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
It's the only thing that...
It was the safe information at that moment that I would die.
It was the aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone if you can't even say the word?
Coucere.
And I was a doll.
And ...
I opened what bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
From then on, I realized.
This information of society to lead in hair.
In fact, the surgery wasn't for me.
I learned it was for them.
That I wasn't able to see myself a doll.
With that, I saw several other information that I thought weren't the most adequate.
When I entered the hospital,
Children said, "Wow, you'll scratch hair to be equal to us."
I said, "No, now it's the same for you."
I got cancer.
No one of you says, "OK, calm, we don't take it, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games were overwhelmed, and the children started talking about many things and counting.
about procedures.
When did I do it?
It's to put the catheter because I did chemotherapy before, the first I made a vein.
I received a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, there's a sabonete.
A toothpaste is a toothpaste, but also a shampoo, a touch.
And a pent.
And I didn't have hair.
And this for me is information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did.
I'd send children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through it."
And what happened?
Children started to give me their procedures.
So they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And things went on.
It was playing, but we think that child doesn't understand, right?
And I think the child doesn't know, she knows the protocol, the name of chemotherapy.
The procedures, all this, sometimes parents try not to talk to protect them.
But then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls."
From then on, who doesn't know how to eat the pharmacy?
The pharmaceut tells you a strong medicine, what will it find?
You'll fall off your hair."
But then, when we explained what chemotherapy caused hair fall.
She killed cells that quickly doubled.
But not only the cells of the tumor click quickly.
As the hair cells also understood, they still said, "Oh, it's working!"
And we started to engage children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day doctors started to connect to me.
If there's a patient who's going to put an athlete, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs, "Oh, but the province is running."
And then I, until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising.
I called the doctors, health professionals and our creative friends, and we decided to open a NGO.
We opened BABA because it's BABA do cancer.
What did we do?
Usually, those who make health information are health and publicity professionals, but you say that information is focused on the patient.
But the patient approached the end, this patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process, we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process.
So we put children to work.
So we spent a lot of time recording what we thought could improve, what we had doubt, what we couldn't understand that doctors said, and with that we illustrated the most common terms.
The environment is a ecological.
And we illustrated all this with the support of health professionals, but with a very important thing, sometimes.
As something seems, you don't need to be explained when you like someone and you write "I love you with the heart."
You draw the ventricles.
I think it's not, so we started doing this, and with that, children started to understand more about processes.
From these terms, our first material came out, which was a guide.
This guide is distributed to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides per year.
If there's a sponsor in the village?
We have, for 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, to start asking, and we're in more than 40 hospitals in Brazil.
Children from outside started to see, started to ask for children from New Zealand, Japan, from several places.
I'd say, "But there's Portuguese, but we have translators."
And Guia is very asked in the northern northern, because children and parents, many times, are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and risk the pages of the procedures children will do.
With this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
In doing many other actions, information, guys, is very important that information, sometimes, is not only that thing, information technology, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotics, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit.
So, what do we say and do we do?
That you need information in everything.
For example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, children, Carexas earn much more present and pay attention to what hair is.
But sometimes the child's child has already done the treatment, he's without cancer.
Sometimes the child is overwhelmed, with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, it's taking care of the clowns, or there's something at some point.
And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, do you have that thing in society?
Unfortunately, I'm an advertising, and we know if we put a kid, shake, sad, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money.
You can't look at the website, this doesn't have it.
And what happens with this, and when you are the patient?
How many times I was in the hospital, in the room, fragile, debilitated, received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?"
Suddenly, I received the obligation of parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "My daughter is giving a lot of problem at home."
I want to take it to the hospital to see what difficulty is.
OK, the mother wanted to do this, but have you ever thought that, inside this room, there was a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window?
To see, the father with my life is good.
And when we need help, when we need empowerment, when we need self-esteem.
You only have information that puts you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
We think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children.
She saved my life.
And today everything I can do is information to save many others.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause)
In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career?
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Unfortunately, it's not easy.
What depends on here is a disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot of people's lives.
"Yes, but...
What if, in fact, if the answer is there?
Inside us.
To treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients have reason.
It's in the search of this that we thought of many things.
One of these things is...
It's our own organism.
This organism has its own defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats.
One of these defenses is in our brain, it's called "factory barrier."
The mattress barrier, despite seeming a complicated name.
It's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain.
What do they do with?
The bacteria, viruses and nocious substances, don't enter the brain, and don't do bad.
For us, for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier.
These are very small molecules, and for being very small, they have almost balanced passage for the emato in being false.
That's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the circuit of reward in other circuits.
We also have another very important protection system, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos and various chemical strategies.
A trip to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, viruses and toxic substances as well.
In this video, you can see the microphone in the blood stream, running behind a bacterium, until it can engage it and neutralize it.
Nowadays.
Is it here?
We couldn't gather these two things together.
Try to help our patients?
Two defense mechanisms, which are innate, which are ours.
(Applause)
A few years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day that some researchers in the United States started.
Studying the people who end up using large number of drugs realized that these people used drugs more.
They produced anticopsus.
Contract your own drug.
It's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
"Stop!"
It's enough.
It's not needing drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
From this point on, we started to think how we could use this immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
And me and my team.
A few years ago, we're researching.
In the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two.
What is capable of sending this message to our immune system?
A message of hope.
In other words.
The immune system produces anticorpos.
With other drugs, we'll try to help this person to win again their freedom and control it.
How does this substance work in our organism?
Do you know that our immune system produces glasses and anti-copes are large molecules?
And then, that problem that Barré and Met Sefalca had to let the drug really stop giving up, because when the user... (Laughter)
It consumes my drug, this small molecule connects itself to a big and "pum."
It doesn't happen in the armed barrier to be false.
Look at this image here, how is this beautiful process?
That's it.
Here, the right to you, we have a while we didn't get the vaccine.
These white dots you're seeing?
It's a molecule of cocaine marked with radiation.
When these rats are not immunized, they receive this cocaine marked with radiation, they freely pass and accumulate in the brain of these animals.
Once we managed to immunize them?
Here you see the left side of you.
There's a very significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain.
What indicates is that this cocaine that was passing stopped passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves, "Where did she stop, since she didn't happen?"
It's very interesting that rats.
The vaccinated has a concentration of radiation much bigger in the blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated and indicating that besides blocking the passage, it's a sharing of these radiation molecules.
There was no blood tissue, that is, drugs were arrested in a blood fabric.
Another very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is to receive a vaccine, they have a behavior.
They didn't realize if they had received drugs, so they were standing inside the box or more inhibited than they don't happen with the rats that receive cocaine.
So, what is our group working now?
In fact, it's to bring this solution to the market and to help people to gain freedom, we believe it.
What is this therapeutic treatment, or the vaccine, drugs?
Can it be a treatment?
that will open a window of opportunity for those people with chemical dependency.
Those who know, in a while with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
Time?
To decide.
A time to gain freedom again and...
To discuss with themselves if they want.
Using or not using drugs.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
Scootererapist.
It's more than 40 years.
I want to say ...
Besides.
It's so happy.
Besides?
That's what it's like.
There's a disease.
Different.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
And I said, "No, lose, go!"
And me?
Let's call it...
North us.
The biology of normality.
And I have to say that ...
Maybe these are one of the encantations?
Great encounter, TEDx.
Thank you very much.
It's no, the song is being ...
Pontuated from the beginning.
What is the noise?
They are habits.
Attitudes.
And together with behaviors.
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some sense.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Is it an example?
Maybe that?
The most dead.
I don't know what it is.
It's the lunch.
Where can I understand?
There are two foundations.
The most important ones.
The nurse.
It's the situation.
Systemic.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
Speaking or fact that not always.
The nurse existed?
Not always.
It's existed.
The norm is a typical disease.
From moments?
"Who?"
We live in a context.
Where predominates ...
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
It predominates corruption.
Dishumanity.
Not only your word.
Egocentrism.
Is it a normal being?
Does this adapt to a sick system?
And keep it.
"I have been."
A worker?
It's more than 30 years old.
From the International University of Paz.
The only step.
And people think that peace is in the bubble.
It's the absence of conflicts.
"No."
"Dad is good fight!"
The opposite of peace ...
Commodo.
The movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars?
"Let's see here, come."
A little of pairs.
Archimilitary for peace.
But with other weapons.
The weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
The love with the passive.
So, that's it.
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must be that ...
That they have the ability to present symptoms.
symptoms, concepts.
Sometimes even.
A conscious, lucid despair.
An indignation?
That's it!
This makes me remember.
It's from a family standard.
When is my daughter?
Isabela.
It's five.
And today she has 34.
There's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What?"
What's the princess you like the most?
"Are you bored, Cinderella?"
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought.
He answered, "What?"
I like all May's written.
And I too.
I've got it.
I respect many people who say more.
Sometimes...
Because it has to be the same to feel.
The own skin?
Dour?
The contradictions ...
That the "normatic" don't sit.
People who sought me.
The disease is panic, for example, all of them.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
What a captain!
There were open doors for perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it the fear of the family system?
It's fear.
of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's fear.
Animals.
I feel disimated.
Of forests.
Be desertified?
In these people say, "Dad!
I respect a lot.
Denominated people.
Psychotics and synthetic.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten him.
That's why, in Africa.
People who are considered crazy?
They are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a paradise that captures.
The contradictions ...
Culturals.
Systemic.
And sometimes they don't fail.
How did I say it?
Right?
The difference between them.
A Santo in a mad person.
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing.
Where others don't know.
I said, "I don't want to talk."
Maybe these people, at least in a big measure.
That we call it.
I don't know.
There are so many failures.
I respect neurotypes, at least I have a decent of having a pain of consciousness, a dream.
The problem?
It's in the lunch, it's the people who don't care.
Humanity.
So I think.
In a occasion, I came to give you a similarity here.
It's hard.
I said, "I don't know what to do."
Taxist.
Or knowing that I was ...
A psychotherapist said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
It's kind.
You get up to a person, but you have to sit down.
He doesn't sing.
He's good.
It's target of bullying.
People hated, ridiculated my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
It's understanding.
What do I want to say?
"So, that's it.
I must say that it's all the people I have.
Respect and admire are all.
Desajusted.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team organized this encounter.
(Applause) Thank you.
And nothing against the correctness.
At that moment, "Oh!
This offers a desert.
"So?
Did you say that?
It's the norm, the machismo.
Education.
So, homophobia?
From diverse?
Exclusions.
It's a lady.
We could say, "No, it's environmental."
The nurse gives.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
And the thunder stands on fire, and each one is looking at a minimum, doesn't realize it.
Is there no sense?
They're alone.
A inexorable globalization, a person ...
Because, generally, the specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
Doing the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe?
Make a concept.
This education that has also been here.
I try.
A possibility of solution?
That I've called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
The desire that brought us.
The incarnation.
What are you in a stage?
We're Handa.
This promise is what I'm doing.
We don't see here.
We came to tell us a story.
Only you can happen.
If you didn't count, she would sing.
So ...
In fact?
Music damage.
"Yes."
It's fascinating.
It's a car.
Very important.
It's an evolution.
You don't even know.
Speaking?
We need to do it.
What differentiates?
A human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Jim.
Pássaro.
"Are you sure of a monkey?"
I think of a friend, "Wow!"
So, it happens.
A Nobel Prize, alternative and economy?
The country in development has a magnificent mammal.
What a dilemma?
When I met my dulce.
He used to say that since he was a child ...
He wanted to know what human beings were disturbing.
And the other species.
It's intelligence, no.
It's language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father ...
And he was very respected.
Your father says.
It wasn't stupid, my end.
He assisted a kitchen, he said he became the first stupidist, (Laughter) "Stopdology is a science that we need to study."
It differentiates itself, for example, of imbecility, who?
It's absolutely...
"Yes."
I like to remember the slowness.
Is it a big brother, a creator of violence?
And he'd say to us.
Is it necessary?
That's it.
"Yes."
Is hippothalamic ideal to be a good animal of the ugly to the corte that will be good?
The question.
Thank you very much.
Because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be extremely stupid, and it's something.
Specifically.
To have diplomas and universities.
Thank you.
To do as a person talking about development.
With graphs.
They ...
Sufficized?
Like a person sitting down.
In the branch of a tree, closing.
"So."
"Nice," she also said.
And for him?
I didn't have it.
Two infinite things.
The universe?
That's what human leaders are.
And she grew up: Einstein.
With relation to the universe.
I still have my doubts.
(Laughter)
But I need to say that I discourse.
Diainist and ...
He said, "I'm respecting you."
And considering what?
They are pointing not for characteristics.
The species, yes, the northern museum.
Human beings ...
It's not your nature.
The stupidity, on the contrary.
We were born to be, to cry.
It's forbidden.
So ...
I prefer to think.
We confuse it.
That it was 2.600 years old, said.
What differentiates our species?
In other species, it's inaccabation, it's in complete.
We don't.
We are born humans.
We do ourselves humans.
A sign isn't born, it's broken, you've seen it, and it's going to the sea."
We don't.
We're angry!
That's why saying confuse: human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
School for tartarugas or for...
That's it.
Are they pleasant?
It's education, it's the perfection, we're belonging to them.
And it's not just about cultivating the brain.
What from the 19th century?
It seems it's only.
To develop a rational testing, no.
It's about following.
Keeping the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist.
To develop emotional intelligence and emotional intelligence?
Intelligence, the unionic of dreams, learning.
To read the book at night?
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concence?
To develop consciousness.
Where?
Jocus, values of a ethics.
With heart.
It's your own.
How crazy!
He summarized like this.
Your long existence.
At the age of 15.
I didn't care.
It's the heart.
To learn.
At 30 I planned my feet.
Fortunately in the floor.
The 40s.
Don't suffer anymore.
Perplexity.
Or 50?
I knew what the cells were.
Do you accept it?
I listened to the elderly.
At 70?
I could follow my own heart indications.
Why did I wish it?
Not more this day, borders ...
Is the same as the terapeutas and Alexandria?
It's been around 2,000 years old.
"Shut up clothes."
Five minutes.
It's to be a whole existence.
to exchange.
It's about how it works.
And this is the task.
In this sense?
The nurse?
It refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust.
It's the biggest discovery of the 21st century.
Is the human being?
Now, the opposite case, the question, will it be?
21st century.
Is it the human being?
It's not less than this against this game.
We need everything.
In the new ones.
Gerations.
So, that's it.
The norm is terrible because it's not anxious, it's in silences.
People don't realize it.
It's not easy to become a human being.
David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being.
But the human being ...
As Tiaxatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to cry.
It's served.
Has anyone asked?
Think about God.
And the IT.
I said, "Thank you."
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a monastery in the big window.
It's flowing.
With human beings?
Specially.
So ...
"I want ...
Still talking?
From a story we hear, "Don't go."
For more than 30 years, the little guy learned to know.
This story.
It was once.
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let us flow."
that would take a source, a water drop, and throw it in the fire.
And I returned.
Obviously, another drop.
He'd play in the middle of the fire.
And I returned.
A patience?
The wings ...
Thank you.
That's bad.
I'd play in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, beija-flor?"
Do you think that with these ridiculous?
What do you do?
"Are you going to pay this fire?"
Inferent, right?
And I said, "I know it's not."
An anecdote to everything.
Now, I'm doing this.
That's my part.
They're all very tired.
Revolutionary networks.
We want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way.
Because hundreds become transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
It's the first responsibility.
It's to introduce a little peace, a little order, a little...
What about love?
In this pedacy of the world, that the big world confies each one of us.
What if we don't do this?
Where can we be transforming facilitators?
That's why revolutions ...
And failed, and I kept failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe?
Would I be aware of it?
Can I do it with others?
Comundo and consistent.
I recommend a book: "The Korean conspiration of Marily Fex."
That studied a lot these movements.
Spontaneous, institutions, from a giant narrative.
"Beautiful!"
There's no ideology, no flag.
He's not cutting anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
From the morning, I'm seeing beija-flores who came.
Each one talking about their water drop.
All of you who are necessary?
At some point, you'll be here, in what you're in this stage.
But in stage.
It's your life story.
Tell your story.
Raise your hand.
His goal had water.
Because always.
Can we turn a candle?
Once only, it's complaining.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
Time.
It's from renewable.
I love it.
Poets.
I believed.
We use it.
Love counts like this and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
I want to conclude with a poem.
It's accessible.
Thank you.
Renovante.
It's born in Tedesco.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multilplick has arms to scenarios everything.
Distribute the eyes you've seen you.
It creates others.
For other visions.
Destrons, arms, who have this meat.
For you to forget.
It's cold.
It's always the same.
Always.
It's not simple.
Always.
Love.
Inside.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
Between a good school.
Keep it.
I took good grades.
choose the profession that will define you for the rest of your life, while you're still a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, a publicity, or a market.
Since my mother has angry.
I chose a university of renouncement, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the least effort.
And it's good channels.
Imagine a multinational company not recognized by their family.
Be calm.
I work twelve hours a day, exhausted until the limit of their forces.
To be obvious.
If I get tired, you need to be chronic.
It makes interminable meetings.
Diocosque didn't take me anywhere.
It shows you that you are important for structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
It's seen the shirt.
It's a six flexible point.
Find someone.
Namor, nievated, marriage.
He mini opponents.
Skype is a corporate pyramid.
It's a shirt.
Lambotas.
A job exchange.
Being a manager.
The car of the firm.
Keep offraiding and happy.
Happiness at the time.
Mrs. Cortados and sapatenes.
Dist, shirt.
Luke is the first apartment.
There's a child.
After two years.
This is your second child.
It's listening.
(Laughter) Strange the car, yes, year, no.
It buys a apartment and suffers 180 payments.
That first case is to be judged with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter)
Two years later, every seven days in Europe.
Miami, Europe, Miami.
More meetings that don't take anywhere.
completely disqualified people being promoted before you.
Projects that start and dismorate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of change.
The void that countries in the mall, in the weekends, can't apply anymore.
The download is a pleasure antenna that if it goes so soon, the market lake is broken.
This shirt.
Living socially every day.
The first apartment I was in the beach, the elite, the antidepressants, the void.
The middle crisis ...
The encounter with college colleagues, "My God, we've spent years fast, life is short."
My children in school, my gods, as they grew fast, are short life.
We're well cut by alphabets of the center, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place.
At the end of the weekend in the beach, at the end of the mountain.
Let's sell the apartment of the beach, children grow up and don't even want to go further.
The shirt.
The external thing is a little high, its flat body, as an astronaut that spent years enjoying zero gravity.
None car, because of the healthy habit of passing the file inside, puts all the infections.
There's no end.
(Audience) Lactose Fry, juice, green.
Speaking of the academic semester that you used for two months, today is fourth, day of ugly.
Hamburgers, after being late, in the film, made a project because life is too short to eat the phase.
The vice-president, which is despite all efforts.
He never got there, probably he will never get there.
The continuous fear of losing a job.
Today, they don't value the most experience.
The fear of everything: new generations, the change, the new one.
Why in my time?
Fear continues that prevents you from living.
Fear of death.
A liver feeling of suffocation: hate, otherwise I'm not focused.
The complete disconnection with your children is decorative of 12 hours of work decades.
The retirement was empty.
Thirty of useless and little affection.
You're a winner, this is your only console.
Your life is disruptive?
Executive.
I saw the shirt.
From a wood, for the true time.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
