(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed by the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil, we are living in paradoxes.
Our children are what we have the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children will be very bad treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection in the poorest children in Brazil, which is the majority of the criteria of Mandela, we are a terrible character, because we deny the basic letters, as a health, housing, food, we treat them with violence, and demand that we can change.
We offer her prison, but even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and daughters, who are here.
The thing isn't going well, we committed, maybe, to a small trip about seven capitals that our society still begins against childhood, and we'll take the thing we don't eat.
The wave of Gabriela, a middle class child, typical.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, affection with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, this baby who will be born, and she then starts to attend the hospital, and, quickly, the medical industry wants to convince me to be the best for her to be a Cesare.
A highly lying argument, but it's very convincing: 93 percent of births in the private network, for example, are harmful, dangerous, painful, that generate a greenhouse statistics in our country, a culture that makes women believe that the normal birth must be accessible, which can be done, but certainly won't have the same benefits in a normal part.
We're criticizing the exaggeration, what's unnecessary, what's lie to me, and you grew up with a wood, that's hungry, it's going home, it's hungry, it's hungry, it's hungry, it's safe, it's strong, the same way it happens with a wooden milk.
The child is crying, the ear is weak, in two months, this child is breastfeeding, and she loses the wonders that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms:
Experted, surprised, and the maternity leave is directly lost with the doctor, doing the doctor, convincing his dinner and congressions, and patrocinating integrally the pediatric impairment that ends unconsciously, being one of the biggest causes of "dismami" in Brazil, and it's also very love, and he's infinitely overwhelming the adult life that science is discovered now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother goes to finish the essence, she'll go to the church, because the grandmother can't take care of it.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, there's no money to pay, and they end up exchanging us, the Brazilian food food food food food food food food food food food food, which is a huge amount of salt and sugar, for the children to live with the most important people in their lives, and we can't take them down, and they can't take them down.
Because they are annoying, from the intoxication of the childhood that also leads serious problems, this is the peculiar, of the intoxication of the childhood that also leads pleasures for our children, and even if we want to give food, it's absolutely unpleasant, it needs to run in cap, go out.
Nevertheless, in our urban life, it doesn't allow us to do this, people have fears to let the child go out, they stay at home, they're a wonderful thing, they're a moment of living, family member of laughing, of things that are in the memory of us in childhood, they're crazy, and they're not even in any case, they're a manner moment of consciousness, they're permanent, they're permanently distracted.
(Laughter) This is the name, Hipport, even in the moments where the child needs the awareness, that's what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive distraction, which we confinate our children, and prevents them from the facts of what is most important for us, the creativity and the imagination, and we're pushing it.
And then, in the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program in Brazil for a week, which is "O."
Very well, when it's going to be more massacred by advertising, by consumption consumption consumers, and that instills in it, values like excessive consumption, hyper-realization of appearance.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, even in the consumption of alcohol consumption, we know that the beer in Brazil is not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, and, obviously, those who need friendships are deeply affected by the consumption.
Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want her to be competitive, an adult of a lot of success, and her agenda gets full of commitments, to relax this stress, and they increase a class of meditation, but she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the marvelous light, who didn't meditate in the balance.
Look at the sky, look at the floor, look at the floor, and then it's going to be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, in desertion, "Look at the floor."
That uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance, and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this reaches the children directly and deforms them into a trunk, it passes to be the queen of the family, not the member of the family, and it goes to the school's the fault of the school, we have to talk to the teacher.
She earns many presents when she needed, it would be presence.
And she realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, she needs people who drive her life, this is generating taste and generating symptoms, we know that it's important for our children, and we're losing that the parents don't have authority.
Doing that they don't have the experience of life, and therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration, with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver to them later, this is the peculiar.
Introonization and superproduction is very easy: Well, before so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, shaken, and will eat too much, or will be obese in school, doesn't pay attention, it's imperative.
We need to do something about this: it's not possible these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chair the solution that we're not going to give them the most covered children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, not the medication, but the mediation for them to behave well.
They go to the doctor, the doctor sees that they are sick, they receive medicine, they go home, buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact.
What Fabio, who is producing, is exactly the medicine, and that's what we're doing for our children, not only with the elastic children, adults also in an overwhelmed way.
The three colors are the market that grows the most for the depression, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, in humanity, had, today in the school, would be exactly this, rotated, normalized, and we'd have lost it in two million boxes, we need solutions, but better, changing the paths.
But for the whole problem, complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
It's obvious, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we think about it, a solution that only changes two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And, in relation to time, what can we do, when we talk about cats, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today, means "dism payment," in almost all the churchs, what do we have of more precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
In relation to space, I'd like to propose an exercise for you: 15 seconds, let's close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you, "Confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, and if we don't give us this week, we start with quality of life, it's not a good place to live."
Visualize this place.
(Music) How would he be?
Look at my eyes and tell me if you fit yourself in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure the majority of you, yes, this shows us a little the importance of nature among us; nature is profoundly associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul.
I talked about the convergence of sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment.
Everything that makes good health, does good for the rivers, does good for the Earth, does the animals, things always react in a positive way, creating vicious circles, and I live with nature, with open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it is, and when I talk about books in childhood, it's different children who will know each other and learn to deal with them, who promote psychology, free events in these spaces, live love with affection, and there are many movements in Brazil, making exactly this, and play in the squares, occupying public spaces.
Accessive and careful squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, and the word occupied practically used for citizen resistance today, means this, occupy public space with joy.
And, mainly, taking part in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catástrofes, as in São Paulo happened, where you're seeing here, in a picture of Billings, a source of São Paulo, 30 or 40 years ago, and today.
For the governance magician, and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they come back, and people demand to the publics returned to the public interest, with their sustainability, with equity.
In the end, the same scientists who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, will live very early, our children will take me full, also say, in 97% of scientific consciousness, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing inequality from the environmental level, doing everything we already know, with transparence and doing this, including here in Porto Alegre.
This year, unfortunately, he said that the utopia is in the horizon, so, in summary, this is our proposal, children, already outside, go outside, take the children to the city, we're going to take care of others, and we're going to reduce inequality, and we're only trying to change an energy phase, which makes us walk outside. (Applause)
(Applause)
In 2007, ...
I came across a great group of young adults with disabilities.
Scluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
It was to look at the efficiency of these people who are marked by their disabilities.
So I created the Cafétherapeutic project, the group of parents, students and friends, searching for a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school.
With parents, with their children and with their partner.
People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents.
For the community and for society in general.
People with disabilities, sometimes they're left aside, stop having friends.
Because they think they're not able.
To have friendships.
To feel like acting with people.
Tell the case of the Igor student, for example, that in the other school he studied.
For four years, he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
And people didn't make an effort for that too.
So, over four years, he was in the court taking part in all the physical education classes.
And since he loved running, he was running all the time.
(Laughter) When I got to Campulimpo, I sought to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school.
And what would we do together?
For him to be able ...
They achieved the best learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a place of despair.
[A.DE.]
Well, is it that it's a pull?
Today, it's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
He has many friends, he says I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present in the parents' Day.
And I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning.
Schools think that they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
We need to use and believe that these children are capable inside the school.
To do good for them, it's going to do good for other students, for school community, and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others.
Why did I choose this way?
I have what I know, I have what you know, and I have what we can learn together.
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years, living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my look.
Conviving with people, they can see.
I learned to use my hearing, I learned to value my legs, living with people who don't hear, with those who can't walk.
(Laughter) And I learned to appreciate my ideas with those that often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart.
The heart of my students, to create connections and friendship lakes.
And the most important thing for society?
And to learn the exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
(Audience) Yes.
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been able to cook.
When I was little, I loved to see my grandmother, a cook.
I cooked, worked in the kitchen, she took account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa, and she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hands in front of her, in fact, was my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen.
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use.
The food as a form of prevention cure and treatment of diseases, because these philosophies rescued in me.
which is the Cuidated zelo and respect for nature.
So I decided we could...
Changing the way we change.
It builds the food system through food.
And I believe...
One of the colateral effects of modernization is the affestation of man with nature, the apartment of the urban life and the rural life, so I believe it's us.
Trucé is a little bit of life.
Rural for the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way that we can connect with nature.
(Audience) Yes!
A few years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
food, food, food, as a tool, not only to improve quality of life in health terms, but also to improve.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with this, we need to change.
It's to get it.
Reestructuring the food system.
Changing the food dynamic, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example, there are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale.
The more it is produced, the more cheap it produces, it's quantity and speed.
The worst is quality.
The biggest cost for the environment and the life cycle of the animal is accelerated artificially and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is accelerated artificially.
It's there.
He begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies come when they don't get it, and he begins to lose, to decrease dramatically, his quality of life, his health and his time of life.
I believe that we can and should change this food system, I was the other day passing from the supermarket and realizing that the kilo of Franco was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex?"
This didn't enter my head.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the process of production in industrial scale is also very... Today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotóxes in the world.
Each Brazilian consumes, on average, 5 kg of agro toxic per year.
It's an overwhelming amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so they continue to tolerate this abuse in the use and consumption.
Thank you.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer is why our current society?
There are inverted values, there's an investment of values, why does a person worry about it?
And not buying a perfume, false, because you think there will be any alergic reaction, because you don't know the procedure, you don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people to value organic products, because, how much do you buy, for example, a mass of alphace?
It's a organic officer, you're paying, not only you're investing in many times, you don't know that behind that alphace, there's someone who cared with all the love and took this leap to you, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why I ...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think it's true.
You must know that we produce a lot of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply dispersed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why there are people still passionate about hunger and reason.
It's a map of distribution, we have to review this.
In terms of consumption?
Also, the way we consume in today's food is scary, my grandmother is paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
If I take it and put it in the middle of the Paulista Avenue, I'm sure it's very important, so it's going to have almost a simple topic, but because it doesn't recognize that as a way of reflection, like a synutric form of feeding itself.
And it's...
So ...
These "foods" foods, these quick foods were made of the same country, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about the cell phone, teclating, watching TV, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these biscuits, and so on, have many chemical adjectors, and they end up destroying our paladar, they degenerate our nervous system, a mental dependence, a psychological dependency, a physiological dependence.
In other words, industrialized products in excess is very prejudicial, I don't even call them food, for me, they're food, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes pipoca of panels, pipoca of panels in the microwaves, look?
This question may seem a little inoffensive, not wanting to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the panels for the microwaves, you're already causing a damage for your health, because you're consuming it.
So, I think the excessive consumption of food production is a chemical embalance that you wouldn't put, I'm sure, absolute, in your panel pipoca, and you're also polluting with the embalance to summarize this issue.
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not healthy, it's not.
It's not working, and we must change, but how can we change?
The main answer is going back to the fuel.
To cook ...
This name of art, culture, leisure, health brings autonomy, brings safety, bring independence, bring self-knowledge, cook is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, someone will cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry, (Laughter) because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes.
So, if you leave the industry feeding you ...
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What about a pizza?
(End of video) So I believe we're the one of the script, because not even the pits we know how to do more.
"Oh, no, man ...
Each rice and the feijon fell, broken the rice of each day, that filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are many people who don't have interest, who don't have a price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very workable, very anti-pratic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave it with molds, at night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes, you have a ready beach in the pressure panel, or you can simply take a day and make the kiss.
And let the rest of the week be frozen, this would be maybe the same time you'd take in 20 or 30 minutes, more the legumes you've already cut and wash in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and half an hour you'll wait for the pizza to get there.
Experal of Pizza's book.
So, I believe that we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, woman.
Little, boy, girl, child, adult.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children taking the fair children to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting the children to dedicate a battle, the value.
Simple things in our daily lives, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic vision of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Many people think they come from the Brazilian to the supermarket, so we'll...
To grow regardless of the food industry, because they will know how to cook, they will grow dependent on the pharmaceutical industry, because they will be much less sick, growing with fear of a food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change.
Dynamics.
In food, we have to change our eye.
Our value we have with food, we have to value the food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to leave, education, education.
It doesn't mean!
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us to have less hospitals, this is education.
It's education and prevention.
The future of food ...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing good foods?
They are choices we can do.
To change the world better.
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Life is not the one we lived.
But it's the one we remember and how we remember to tell.
It's here in the background.
To talk about the transforming power of stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family are here.
I came here when I was a child, I spent vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My great-grandmother was the first tribute planter.
From the Brazilian mechanism, here in the lands of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother Tília and had seven children inside them, who got married with my father and after having my five siblings.
I arrived in this world, casually, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago, it's the stories we tell that make us be who we are, and tell them, we transform ourselves, and who listen to them.
And it also transforms us, we want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who come back and honor all stories.
My passion for stories started very early, I've always liked to write, to read, to tell...
In school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me live the mourning, and I know he helped many people too, so having told this story to me one of the most beautiful things about this, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in the other's history, they feel in the school of each one's stories.
So it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because, obviously, someone ...
Go, come and sit in the school of this story and feel welcomed.
But one day, I met this whole world here, from TEDx, I met incredible people around the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood at the age of 45 that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories because the world of advertising had already been very small to me.
So I started doing this: if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx.
about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable about bubble, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bubbles.
Because that's what he always suffered.
And he wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with the subject, but I had water.
While we prepared to talk about it, he always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints with the right, about everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal of telling a story, being to keep complaining who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can assume who they are, as we already said here, without fear?
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time he was gay openly.
He talked to a lot of property about bullying, acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this a lot, because I don't only have this transformation with him, the people I know they know.
Also, having seen that the wheelchair they imagined that Tiago had was nothing more than a great defeat.
And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story a lot of people.
The week went by, he sent me a lesson in his story.
That many boys have sought him, even more in the air.
It's the time that's so expensive of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his history, that they wanted to share with them the problems that were going through in his families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And this hadn't assumed for people in a way that didn't have any shame.
So, telling stories to me ...
These are micro-revolutions in our lives.
They're many, not only in them, but also in my own of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear.
We transform ourselves.
And for me, there's no rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this at seven years old.
training many people to be here, in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give tips about how to start, about how to ask a question to the audience.
It counts something funny, shows the picture of your children, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a great rule.
You have to come from the heart and, to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has the heart color.
That's what I want to say.
I told Ave's story, "Oh, there's a teacher from the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening."
And we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDxLossador, and there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day, two weeks before all.
From his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "It's all here, it's all here, and it shows me your head, how much, in fact, you have to leave everything from here."
It has to be a heart.
And he changed everything.
And one day, he gave a incredible talk about listening.
It's about the importance of listening to others and how it was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the most, when he was a kid, when he had cancer.
What did he do with?
It was to study about this.
And it was him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, there are so many written instructions, but who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me and we saw this today that, how much do we hear, really?
We change ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves, we're afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change, but ...
There's always this fear, and as we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
For us?
And for others.
And the listening ...
We also see, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy.
But we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time.
To people.
Why are we worried?
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
(Laughter) But this, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'm going to ask you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most marked stories I listened, all the others ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) That empathy, I also learned collectivity, for example, that when we say on the street, many of us don't have anything to give.
When they ask us something?
We have "yes."
We have at least one smile.
And he doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others, we truly transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listen and tell him too, it's transported, and in the middle of the preparation a fight that was the process here for me, it was out of my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today, and asked me, "But Ana, after all, why are you doing this?"
Now, and helping people.
And the answer for me ...
And for everyone, I came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To give her the key to your lives.
From the fourth of the flaws, the values, the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many people I know.
The right to cry, the right to change, to give them the faith in life, the faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, to say that they have the right to change, the right to love three, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Freedom of your story, which, although important, is not determining.
Freedom of fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of rest, then they could look at the side and come back to smile, tell and hear.
And you, what stories are you going to tell about your life, what stories do you want you to tell about?
Thank you. (Applause)
(Music) The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, or there are no judgments, where there are all kinds of stars.
It's only linked to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while during a very obscure phase that fell over my life, a phase in which the right of just being denied to me.
However, I didn't look for acceptance, but in respect, since the moment I recognized myself, as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender who was attributed to her at the moment she was born.
So, why is it that we, here below, so small, can't produce something so simple, that acceptance, empathy, and, precisely because this creates this poem, because it makes a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars in the sky?
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal, so that's why we have privilege and the opportunity to be different, we learn new stories, new narratives.
So I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself today to know something or someone different from you, allow yourself.
Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a escape flight, where I could be the same, where I cried, where I questioned God or why I was different.
(Laughter) But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me, "Well, the bathroom turned into a better friend, he was always there after a bubble replete, or when I wanted his place in my head and dance rebeldes, because I only repeated until today.
Or better, why do I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom?
The fact that I'm different, from there I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, because of lack of information?
And when it's about the most difficult universe, I researched on the Internet, but there were people like me, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see my friends transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me, since I want to become a traffic, like this, everyone became, therefore I thought and started the wrong way.
So, I started looking for my true decency, and I started to disappoint myself, for example, because of this process, it has difficult phases when you are in the midst of a lot of transformations, and you still have to learn to deal with the non-acceptance of the other, it's as if you enter a casula, stay a time there, and this is a beautiful turning line.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, are you transmitted, our new thing, there's no traffic face, "No, are you so easy to pass, people, who are consciousness, choose, what life expectancy of 35 years?"
Is there any crazy person here who wants to live like this?
While men exist, have their life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, chooses and seeing the country that kills trans people all over the world?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the Antra, the National Association of transvestite Women, said that we, the most successful women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of murdering and murdering, more than a man, and violence.
Being trans isn't an option, but in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's a wheelchair and a force, resistance, expectation for 35 years, there's no one who could mediate the best panel, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish a transistor, I became a model, a magazine of "J" and "perform" and YouTube, and in an abstain career, after I finally found that I could define this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(Cheers) (Applause) It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went from my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like "Macher, shown," "You'll never be a woman, die."
What doesn't have a price?
(Applause) (Cheers)
What has no price is this message of mothers, of other trans girls, degrading me.
Because by teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best one is to receive a message of other trans mines with brilliant eyes, thank me.
"Tell me there and see yourself there."
This has no price.
For example, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm far beyond this, I'm far beyond it, but to understand this, I need to really understand that we're many, we're plural beings, the aggrega, to understand the difference to something that can definitely change the world.
The sky?
I refuse from being isolated.
Who was me, a being next to me?
A blue immensity, freedom without limits.
I and the sky, the yours and me.
No more looks, I don't ask myself to stop, I've already delivered my corridors.
On the past, only those who remain are scars, who mark my soul.
But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: a cell phone, now I'm, now I'm going, I'm going, I'll fly ... (Applause)
(Applause) I'm a volunteer, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and accompanying children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, many times, I couldn't explain what cancer was, what was treatment, protocols, procedures.
And they knew that I had a ovarian studio, that doctors called "Tera toma," a beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly, to take the tumors, you won't take a sixth."
Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate, I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there, I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point, nothing, at the same time I was full of pipes and connections.
The belly is all mixed, I called the nurse and asked, "Are she talking about?"
So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's out of visiting."
(Laughter) So I asked her to handle me.
until I slept.
I cut only after the room, I was with cancer, metástasis, and committed gangs.
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites, and the only thing that ...
It was the safe information at that moment that I was going to die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone if you can't even say the word "cancer"?
And I was a doll.
And the whistle bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were in the year to help me, and then I realized.
In fact, the surgery wasn't for me, this information of society to help them in hair.
I wasn't able to see myself a doll, and with that I went to see several other information that I thought weren't the most adequate.
(Laughter) When I entered the hospital, I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer," I got from you, "Well, we don't take it, you can stay close to me, don't take it."
But the games were overwhelmed, and the children started talking about various things and counting about the procedures, when I did chemotherapy before, the first I made a veil, I received a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, there was a sabonete, a toothpaste and a teeth curve, but also a shampoo, a touch.
And a pent.
I didn't have a hair, (Laughter) and that, for me, is information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, and what happened?"
The children started to give me their procedures, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong remedy, that's why it's hair." So they showed me, sent videos, pointing chemotherapy, passing through the radio, several procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me what it's going to find.
That's going to fall on my hair, but when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair fall, because it killed cells that get hurt quickly, but not only the cells of the hair clicked, they still said, "Oh, it's working, and the doctors started to connect me."
If there's a patient who's going to put an athlete, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs in the end, it's focused on the patient, he's in the middle, and our creative friends, and we've decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, which we can't understand that the information is focused on the patient.
(Laughter) I think it's not, so we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes: these terms leave our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides per year.
If there's a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we've been pulling 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask, children from New Zealand, Japan, several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese," but we have translator, and GI is very asked in Northeast, because children and parents, many times, are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and risk the pages of the procedures children are going to do with this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
And information, sometimes, is not only that thing, information technology, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotic modernity, sometimes information is a slope.
In a kit, so what do we say, and we prepare?
That if you need information in everything, for example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, Carecas children earn much more present and attention than hair children, but sometimes the child is already done the treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes the child is overwhelmed, with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, it's taking care of the clowns, or there's something at some point.
(Laughter) And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if we put a careful child, sad, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money, but what happens with this when you're the patient?
How many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship and, suddenly, I receive parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home?"
I want to take it to the hospital to see what difficulty is.
(Laughter) Very well, the mother wanted to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to go to the window, to see a good life.
You have information that puts you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
(Laughter) We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
(Applause) In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career.
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I only don't stop what I don't want."
And, fortunately, it's not easy because dependency here gives me a disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, if, in fact, the answer is inside us to treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right?
In the search of this, we thought about several things: one of these defenses is in our brain, it's called "factory barrier," which can be protected by big threats, it's a very small molecule and, by being very small, they have almost balanced by the brain barrier, and act in our brain, the circus reward in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection, which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, until it can engage it and neutralize it.
Some years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day that some researchers in the United States, studying the people who end up using big drugs, we realized that these people who used more drugs, we couldn't add these two things to try to help our patients.
They produced anticopse against their own drug, it's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
It's enough, it's not needing drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use the immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
(Laughter) And me and my team.
A few years ago, we're researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to win again their freedom and control it.
How does this substance work, when the user consumes drugs, this small molecule connects itself to a large molecule and, "pum," it's no longer in the armed barrier, it's false.
And look at this image here, like this beautiful process, these white spots you're seeing, it's a molecule of cocaine in the mark with radiation, when these rats don't immunized, receive this cocaine marked by radiation, it freely passes and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
There's a very significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, which indicates that this cocaine that was passing stopped passing.
Besides, we ask ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is the chemical independence, that this treatment, the vaccine, therapy, is a much bigger concentration in the blood, that the rats don't happen with the rats.
Those who know, for a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time, a time to decide, a time to win new freedom.
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
The psychotherapist ...
It's more than 40 years.
I want to say it ...
Besides.
It's generous.
Besides?
It's a psychologist.
There's a trendy disease.
At the end, everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
Whether he's old, he's going.
And me?
We call it "normal."
A normality pathology.
And I have to say that...
And maybe these are one of the encantations?
To have this TEDx big encounter?
Thank you very much.
It's here.
"No, the song is sitting."
Pontuated from the beginning.
What is the nurse?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some sense.
In some meditation.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Is it an example?
The most dead.
What? What?
It's the lunch.
Until where I can understand, there are two foundations.
The most important ones.
The nurse is the situation.
Systemic.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
Disrespect the fact that the norm has always existed.
Not always existing.
The norm is a typical disease.
From moments?
What do we live inside a context?
Where predominates ...
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
of predominating corruption.
Dishumanity in your word.
Egocentrism.
So, is it normal?
Does this adapt to a sick system?
It's about keeping it.
"I have been."
A worker?
For more than 30 years.
From the International University of Paz.
The only step.
And people think that peace is in the bubble.
What happens is the absence of conflicts, no.
"Dad is good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars, Perei, who came here?
A little of pauses.
To shout down the peace.
But with other weapons.
The weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
The love is compassible.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must be that ...
That they have the ability to present symptoms.
symptoms and concepts.
Sometimes even ...
A conscious, lucid despair.
An indignation?
Just that.
This makes me remember.
From a family disorder.
When is my daughter Isabela?
And today she's 34, and she's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What?
What's the princess you like the most?
"Are you bored, Cinderella?"
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought, "Wow!
And he answered, "What?
I like all May's written.
And I, too.
I'm sorry.
I respect many people who say more.
(Laughter)
Sometimes, because there's accessibility to feel in your own skin.
I love contradictions.
That the "normatic" don't sit.
People who sought me with panic disease, for example, all.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
That they captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it the fear of the family system?
It's a method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction.
It's the fear of animals.
I feel disimate.
Of forests.
And these people say, "Dad, being desertified."
I respect a lot.
People denominated by psychotics and neurotics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten him.
That's why, in Africa, people who are considered crazy.
They are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a "parraia" that captures.
The contradictions ...
Culturals.
Systemic.
And sometimes they don't fail.
And how did I say it?
Stop!
The difference between them.
A leap into a mad person.
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
And he doesn't say anything.
Maybe these people, at least in a great measure we call...
I said, "Yes."
Psychotics are saints, failures.
I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consensus, a dream.
The problem is in the weapons, it's the people who don't care.
It's dehumanity.
So, I think of a occasion that I come from a seminary here is Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, when I knew I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
It's kind.
He gets up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing.
He's stupid.
It's target of bullying.
People get rid of my son, what do I do with my son, he's good?
I don't need to understand.
"What do I want to say?"
It was in lunch.
So ...
I must say that it's all the people I do.
respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this encounter ... (Applause) And nothing against correctness.
(Laughter) At that moment, you have to suffer from a desert.
So ...
You talked about the nurse, of the machismo.
Racism, homophobia.
From diverse?
Exclusions...
"Wow, that's great!
Could we say, "No, it's environmental?"
The nurse gives.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything about almost nothing, (Laughter) is the deaf person catches fire, and each one is looking at the minimum, doesn't realize, their existence doesn't make sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person who is generally specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
Doing the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe?
There's a concept.
In this education that has also been here.
Pontade.
How do I feel a possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice ...
From the desire that brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what's us in a stage like this.
It's because we're wrong with a promise that we're saying.
We see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
And only you can happen.
If you didn't count, she would get stuck.
So ...
The foundation of the norm?
I don't know.
The situation.
It's a car.
It's very important.
It's the evolution, it's also been said today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
(Audience) Yes!
Jim.
A bird of a snake, of a coco?
I ask a friend, "Wow, give a space."
A alternative Nobel Prize, economy?
Mãe went, Max, Life, Chilean, from developing country.
When I met my partner, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know who the human being was disturbing.
From other species.
Intelligence, no, language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father, that world, respected.
Your father says, "It won't be stupid, my end."
Audience: Oh!
(Laughter) It differentiates itself, for example, the immersiality, the one who acced a little light, he says that the first stupid estup has become a science that we need to study.
It's absolutely...
And he told us that it's necessary to be a DNA, I like to remember the slower, the creator of violence, a big brother.
The hypotalamic idiot, to be a good animal, of the vacation to the corte that will be good?
The question ...
It's stupid, because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly...
It's rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
"Molified."
To do as a person talking about development.
With graphs, tablets...
Suffisticated?
Like a person sitting in the tree's branch and closing.
So ...
"Nice," she also said.
That for him only had ...
Two infinite things.
The universe?
This human stupidity.
And he grew up: "Ahimist, with relation to the universe, I still have my doubts." (Laughter)
But I need to say that I discourse.
Diainist and Max nephew, although he's sponting us.
And considering what?
North Mozen are pointing not to the characteristic of the species itself.
Human beings ...
It's not your nature.
The stupidity, on the contrary, we were born to be, to cry.
It's going to be said.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
That it was 2.600 years old, I said.
What differentiates our species of other species is inacabation, it's in complete.
We are not born humans.
We do ourselves humans.
A sign isn't born, it's tired, you've seen it, and it's going to the sea."
We don't...
Are we inacabados?
That's why saying confuse: human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
School for tartarugas or for...
It's so pleasant.
Education is the perfection, we are the perfections, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems that it's just developing a rational test.
It's about following.
Keeping the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist.
Emotional intelligence, the unionic intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concence?
To develop consciousness.
Where?
Jocus, values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
He summarized like this.
Your long existence.
At the age of 15, I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
At 40?
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
At 50?
I knew what the fears of the sky were.
"Are you sure?"
I listened to the elderly.
At 70?
I could follow my own heart indications.
Because what I wanted, not more this day, borders.
It's justice.
Is the same as the terapeutas and Alexandria?
He told us, "You exchange clothes for 2,000 years."
And five minutes, take a whole existence.
It was exchange.
It's about how it works.
And this is the task.
In this sense?
The nurse ...
It refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, the opposite case, the question: will there be 21st century?
Is it the human being?
It's not less than this against this game.
In the future.
From the new ones?
Geractions.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's not insidious, it's in the silences, people don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Give didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being.
As Tiaxatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to be seen.
Someone asked for the IT.
Think about God.
And the IT.
I said, "Thank you."
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a sterile of the big wine.
It's fluorescent.
With human beings?
What potentially?
We are.
So ...
"I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to doesn't happen.
For more than 30 years, the little guy learned to know this story.
It was once.
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let us flow."
that would take a source, a water drop, and throw it in the fire.
And I'd go back resiliently, another drop.
I'd play in the middle of the fire, and I'd come back with patience.
It's a bit like this.
That there are woods.
I'd throw it in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, see, flow?"
Do you think that with these ridiculous?
Gotinhas, are you going to pay this infernal fire?
I say, "I know it's not."
An anecdote to everything.
Now, I'm doing this.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary.
People who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way.
Because hundreds become transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order, a little ...
What about love?
In this pedacy of the world, that the big world confies each one of us.
What if we don't do this?
Where can we be transforming facilitators?
For these revolutions, I want to tell you.
And they failed and continued failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
Can I, with others?
Comundo and consistent.
I recommend a book: "The Korean conspiration of Marily Fex."
That studied a lot, these spontaneous, institutional movements, from a giant narrative.
"Beja flower," there's no ideology, there's no flag, he's not cutting anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
From the morning, I'm seeing "Beja Flores," who came.
Each one talking about their water drop.
And all of you who are necessary, everyone.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you'll be in this stage, but in the stage.
It's your life story.
Tell your story.
And taking ...
Your ego had water, because it's always.
Can we turn a candle?
Instead of just complaining.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
Is it time?
In renovation.
I love it.
Poets.
I believed.
What do we read?
Love counts like this and poetry.
It's still saving the world.
And I want to conclude with the poem of the sixth windows.
Renovante.
It's born enthusiasm.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multiply has arms to scenarios everything.
To destroy the eyes, to have seen you, to create others.
For other visions.
Strange arms that had this meat.
For you to forget.
It's beautiful.
Being always the same.
Always, another.
But simple.
That's it.
Always far.
And inside.
Of all.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause) Between a good school.
It decorates.
I took good grades.
The choice is the profession that will define you for the rest of your life while you're still a child.
(Laughter) Whenever being a lawyer, an advertising, or a market, since my mother has angry.
I chose a collection of genome, of public preference.
I spent four or five years using the law of the least effort.
They receive a channel, "Are you in a multinational company recognized by their relatives?"
Whether it's "treaming," it works 12 hours a day, it's high to the limit of its forces.
To be obvious, your cancer needs to be chronic.
There are interminable meetings, videocose that wouldn't take anywhere.
It shows you that you are important for structure.
More than working?
It's important to appear and it's always producing.
Listen to the shirt.
He, mini opponents, cares a six flexible point, finds someone, boyfriend, boyfriend, marriage.
Vista to the shirt, bambots.
The job exchange.
Being a manager.
The car of the firm.
(Laughter) "I want to freeze in happy hour happiness."
I mean, badly cutting and shoes.
She said, "I saw the shirt."
Luke is the first apartment.
There's a child.
After two years, your second child is to listen.
(Laughter) Strange the car, year, no.
It buys a apartment and suffers 180 payments. (Laughter)
That first case, this conjugal extra with an interesting person in marketing, Disney, two years later, 7 days by Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami, (Laughter) more meetings that don't take anywhere.
completely disqualified people being promoted before you.
Projects that start and dismorate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of change.
The void that countries in the mall, in the weekends, can't apply anymore.
