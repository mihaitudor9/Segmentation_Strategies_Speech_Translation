Have you ever thought about how people's residents are?
If there's any difference?
Or should I have my role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
From then on, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers took the sewage to make some adjusts and that made the fall of the piece lose.
When they lost a long time, they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived.
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of the piece's spirit.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no retreat to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress, with some surface, and obviously I didn't put a scholarship in my back, because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button, to facilitate the time to pass the head.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegics, the ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will wear the person and for paraplegics, who give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for pattern?
I made a website.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information, like size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
It's to think about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
For them to no longer need to find the ideal clothes?
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I deal with the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and that means?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Are they ready and stamped?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition?
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"Me?"
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
That the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who have already been launched the second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
And the world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
So, I realized that all this, my work I'm doing with the children, and today, when I'm in the community, I'm always talking to my children, and today, when I'm in the community, when I'm talking to the child, I've been working with the child, I've been talking to a lot of money, and I've been working with a lot of money, so I've always been looking for a lot of money, and I've been looking for a few kids, and I've been looking for my kids, and I've been looking for a lot of money, and I've been looking for a lot, and I've been looking for a lot of money, and I've been looking for a lot of people, and I've been looking for a lot of money, I've been looking for a lot of people, and I've been looking for a lot of money, I've been looking for a lot of money, and I've been there, I've been there, I've been there, I've been working with a lot of people, I've been working with a lot of people
I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California, to generate these children, they're very proud.
In my family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true and create this family.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the largest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
Imagine all the most parents who are here, like we feel, as a fear of losing our child.
And we had two options: we were going to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for an ossy to find it.
From then on, it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the greatest friends, divulging the company, social networks, brought us a very important message for all of us, the first for us, and then for the rest of the world, for him to be cured.
That when a child gives you leukemia and you risk of life, all or rest of problems, of fears, of concerns don't matter.
Moreover, it doesn't really matter, and we learned to be this lesson and it was spreading for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, saying, "It's true, it doesn't matter the problem I had."
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor, was that people saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes you, just like all these families, because, deep down, it doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to be a family, or a father, or a father of a mother, to be a family, this union, that gives life, that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease, to the world: "What?"
My blood, my anxiety, we can make them the ability to donate blood for those who need it, so it's also raised this awareness, our manufacturer.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating "medula ossea" is challenging as the "medula ossia" to the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, I was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in my life, and that's the message that I believe in it."
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, we are not going to save such a credit life, but for that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in Laikon.
It's good for you.
The base is like you.
This is deafness.
Two here.
My name is Pala-La del Tinaü.
His Syrian was born in Damasco.
Ciria's capital.
In January, I studied at the University of Damasco.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not like that, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
The Arabic is a bit...
In front of Portuguese.
(Laughter) That's it.
And these two guilt.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brochancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do like this.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population was 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child.
Three kilos of clothes.
Honey of Engineering.
All those apartments.
I'm a car in Damasco.
And I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15, 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities of the country.
My mask city was the saferest in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
After five years of war, my country is destroyed.
Guys, those who know me were forced to carry or run out of their children.
They found their fertile voices and mutilated by a bomb, they disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again.
Or not?
Today, millions of Syrian have been killed or have been killed in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, noise and relatives, our life will be back.
I still don't know if I'm going to be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'm going to live them again.
To protect my family.
I went to Barabairoti.
After ten months, I knew that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city to go to Brazil.
Why did they have more opportunities?
And I had only one week to leave behind 40 years of my life.
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, Zara, nine months ago, I had a party to celebrate the university of my children, and everyone talked very well, two 11-year-old children, and I was invited to the kitchen very well.
It's making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook page, "Hey, Syria," that's why now everything has a paper and paper, but the number... (Laughter) I'm in the food of Syria.
And I make food and deliver to Tibor WhatsApp.
We're happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you, or a journalist says, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a human person, think I'm angry of blood."
It's allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly the god.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French, but also Branuz or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of Islam or a basic religion.
I'm not a sacred book that kills a person in which she had killed all men and who read how she killed another, hosted, corruption, a Earth, life, all men, Alkurão, "Sure your mother, see Polo, 32."
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there is no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even like the differences of religion culture.
When people come, a woman using Ri Jabi, that length that covered the hair, like my wife, my wife asked questions, "How?"
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home too?
Alexandre Jabi or Slam has other rules.
Men and women can't touch me, embrace, embrace me, but I've already seen human beings doing all this.
Kebeijam is the hug.
Look at this or slam, those rules, more each person wants to eat, or not.
The debate also brings some things to be the same way they have to be, that they don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I drink alcohol or sex with more than a partner.
This is not happening, comic.
(Laughter) Why?
Because those things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after the agency exhibits, people always understand and respect.
The perfect woman says we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value.
That we must have truth with everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians, or slam, well, that we have to help those who need.
Every year we have Elsaacá and we give 2,5 percent of all our money for the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if poor people are human, crystal or Jewish, and I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil, the world knows the best Islam.
To conclude with "O" or "brecocent."
They make my children.
These are your children.
Valbuder, grow, together in base.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of the Santos Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always wait for the reach.
Those who always believe in their reach, don't believe, soon because of hope, but at the end of the field, I know who suffers, the desire makes food, my salary ends, just like this race, study the girl, what they told me, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity of service, I had a lot of hands, cook.
"Fashineira, why don't you hire me in the mall?" I don't understand if it was for the option all right, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the mouth told me, "You follow this corridor, go back, go back, go to the left, go to the left, go to the left, enter that the little room, that the mall is just waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, the page I created in Facebook, still didn't fulfill four months, and, as I created this page, it wasn't programmed, I was at home, from the page, I took the day to see everything I achieved, my dream was to live next to the beach, and today I live in front of the beach.
I put everything that happens, my mother even slept with me, "Menine, all of you can do, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos, and then I decided to share the things that came to me in my first story, so that, in this case, some stories, I'll start some stories, I'll be able to use the glass in her house and not even the bathroom.
In her house.
There was the bathroom for domestics, but there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, I fought.
This first story on the Internet became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only past stories and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I gave interviews to various media, both international media, national media, London, TV, Germany, and several others, what I was super surprised when I said with these reporters, I saw Skype, that everyone.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces, that the employment announces that I titled as abusive announces, the most valued domestic domestic domestics winning for hours, so totally different from our country, for example, a announcement I read.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry, I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did, and I've always liked reading, but there are domestic, spending for these conditions even today, there are domestic ones, not being able to use the bathroom, and suffer all the books I always wanted, and go to the surprise, the Regina enter in the room.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher in history since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
And for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly and show that the slavery hasn't yet ended.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy," "Yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a job like any, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic, my grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I also went to Mexico, because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with a good appearance photo, would never be ready.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me at least a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, and that's it, and then you are!
Yes, or I'm magic ... (Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are logical apartments, which were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not so far away, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
It's almost the case of employee.
So, if I'm going to clean the room, it's the kitchen of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take from a small girl, with so much ice and affection, the mother was always going to work, it's the kitchen of the employee, and it was so I've been running, and I've been waiting for a lot of time for her to get there, and I'm a lot of money.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I'm drunk, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I said that I'm going to change my job, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you earn a lot of Brazilian reais a month, and she started to cry, and said, "Why are you using a little bit of smiling, because I also left my children in northeastfe, and I'm a little bit of smiling, and they need this money?"
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in the owner, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause)
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and raft.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should be here on my side, and that at some point they will be, everything I do.
The race that my life isn't thinking about money that we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, because in other countries, many domestic patterns, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we will decrease a little bit of the disguise in this country, so I'm here with private property, and I'm not talking to six million dolls.
Sound Africans and unforgetted.
And I'm here today to talk about silence, because I'm dying of fear, and if you stay in photographing my fear, I'm here today to talk about silence, not photographing, but the only way to communicate is talking about silence.
What is silence for you, what is silence for us, human beings?
I was accepted in a table in a surgical center, and then the pain didn't stop, if you don't allow yourself to look at you in the silence of your head, emotionally, and then he turned to me and said, "Frecisco, you're never going to know who you are."
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I remembered a phrase of a author, "You're determining my choices, that I found the first past of what you've already lived, it's a human being, it was fear, and you're not the door of entering a state of presence, there's no color, there's no color."
Now, little by little, I'd like to challenge each of you to take your cell phone, remember, many of you, others justified the importance of it, "No, I don't need it."
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
And you, who were fighting the notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment, display your cell phones, put your cell phones on the floor, (Laughter) put your scholarships on the floor, display this space, put them on the floor.
Now, with all closed, you're not disconnected, look at the ceiling walls, look at the ceiling, look back, look at the ceiling, look at the ceiling, you're fine, get even a little bit.
He was connected, guys.
Close your legs, close your eyes, turn where you are, look, close your eyes.
Put your hands, close your eyes, put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes, anyway, it's not the fear of this guy here in front of you, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's a real fear of what's inside, a fear of this emotional map of life history, of eyes closed.
Take this step with me.
Remember where you are, remember the walls, remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, a south of Brazil, in Latin America, they locate themselves.
At this moment, we are connecting a natural and subutilized system of the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
At this moment, a piece of different minds are sitting down, knowing where you are, and leaving the space vocalization system, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the fifth floor, and feeling where you are, and soon you learned that a little before the hand touching the chicken, you felt the temperature and took your fingers to the chicken.
Observe yourself.
And apply the space location system that you occupy inside this room: the volume, the area, your minimum space, think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that, they feel.
What makes the area you take.
I open my eyes.
I came here today to tell you that a lot of what we do is to look inside, it's in silence, because the connection of fact happens when you communicate, it's new, it's a state of presence that decorates it, it's not only new, it's determined as a new inclusion, it's not difficult, it's not difficult.
It's TEDxT.
It's true that I had the first video, (Laughter) normally.
(Laughter) From a demand of an ideal legion in a TED form, that asked for disabled people to share their friends, their colleagues, their family.
At least, it has an influence in the same time.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
16,16 languages, and almost always 6,000 different translations.
These fears and events like these here.
But, as to allow people with hearing impairment, they can do it.
But it's also Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
MP: To later be fertilized at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially?
It's subjects like "technology," "Entrortinment," which is the "e" we can translate as "diversion" and design the people to refer to.
The ones that come from the seventh or the political, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
Three hours of smell.
The theme is this inventive DNA.
It's that it's terrible that we have, then we don't.
On the other hand, the reduction.
"Daddy, I'm going to take this video game."
It's translating and wanting to transcribe as a bubble false in the NGOs that can be.
And not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that translator is a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do this day and translate it alone.
(Laughter) Not only because I had so tactic people, as I'm getting here.
"Oh, my excellent cognitive!"
(Laughter)
And to become those who are at the time, honestly, that I don't have a doll.
And I also didn't have doubts, I wanted to study.
Specifically and try to commit myself.
To donate the time that's left is different from the same.
And it's a source of young people.
Always, a dream of knowledge in the middle, world researches a lot of work, many hours of researching.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent, pleasant, too.
The best thing that makes us, he can always do better.
Because the text can be better.
And I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, right?
Or how we call it "DC."
In the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese, where we have Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different, we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention in here.
Very well. (Laughter)
Do you want to hear me?
A deep political crisis, isn't it?
My father, who, today, had been two years if he was living, got a primary course, despite this, I knew very well how to write well and make the rooms have mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond what he was studying for his four children.
Knowing that, also, as a commercial, Jumbi that Matele had a presence shop had a restaurant.
There are 1,200 seeds.
All of them, literally, without the roof.
My mother, who today has a few years old, is my help, right?
It was not knowing about cooking.
My wife's wedding supported me, and she decided to do "condicks" to sell.
So, even though we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to invest in a new world.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it wakes you with data of the national research for samples or homicides.
This fascination, this passion.
And a body, in the country, happens in the pink of the ozone, he sees a bubble, the eye visits to appear in the car.
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest pants of the park, but for my father, they would get hurt without knowing, they were living there.
One of the smaller conditions of what we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my life, of my greatest friend, who are my beloved children, Daniel, Nik, the ones I've never put this classmate for me, but for those I did.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children, a coincidence, not four of us, my brothers, became teachers, education is a group of revolutionary ideas that applies to me.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion with initiatives on the TEDx has a fair TV.
What does TED mean, just like my father went to a simple way to explain them?
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where I can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how the letters worked, the numbers, the symbols, and so they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it was super complicated, I started to write the letters from dots to my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I stopped buying a rule, which is a little that allows me to write in Braille, where you write that shows the release.
I ended up going to my notebook and my agenda where I wrote to her that I was learning, I gave tips, and we thought that maybe Braille could take part in the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "maker" course in the school.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming, our teachers, and we wrote everything and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the eyes of the minutes, in Braille, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel, and we tried to create something to help others from what they taught us, and it was very exciting.
AC: All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from an interest in us could help with our aunt and potentially many other people, and that showed us how much we need to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help people.
I leave you to ask you a question: What do you think that, in a book and consent relationship, or adults who don't give sense to their consent, are cases of crime, two or more adults who receive their clients in apartments, in hosthes, or even in very sensitive relationships, can have sexual relationships, with other adults who do it?
In sexual reaction, children, and even in the case of prostitution, against sexual exploitation, it's to confuse a small part, as if it were all, the tendency to confuse that it's forced, that it's coaged, there's also a sexual case.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, Campo de Calfenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks, and that, in fact, are phenomena that are not identified, but that can be included.
Of course, when we talk, when we interview the advantages and disadvantage that enter an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destroyable, like gender inequalities, social inequality, we know that there is a diversity of constraints that influences the whole person has the same options, the extraordinary world is not recognized.
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who prostitute you, think.
The Western societies, and I bet most of you think of one of the two situations, or in a single woman in the street, there's a diversity of people, of practices, of positive experiences, and of life trajectories, which are in a very specific street street street street street, and I tell you that the studies that are made of facts, there are also many women of sexual work.
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiled here, in Portugal, since 1999, it's only minority, but it's not mechanical data, but it's also a victim of a teacher, or a customer, and that has been analyzed by 10 to 20% of the people who do sexual work.
(Audience): Yes.
Another idea we have is that all the people who can do this as an option, the people who have disability, even countries who have the idea to criminalize the clients, are the people who are perfectly related to sexual relevance, and now who are the right to say, and who go to sex professionals.
(Laughter) If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
When they drive in institutions in the area of the section and social security, and they are treated with the concept, and the stigma is a mark that is considered illegitimate, normal and natural, if this can be done without violence, because we continue to disrespect people who do this activity.
The worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta, and in that sense, the stigma of puta is a tool that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that splits socially, it's a tool that is at the service of the control of feminine sexual sexual sexuality, any woman knows how to catch the risk can be called puta.
So, what do I think we can do with a group that has been, after all this, to challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, to hear the sex workers, to give voice to a group that has been able to do so that we don't believe in scientific evidence and empirical positions, and not political ones that are built from sex budgets.
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex sovereignors.
Thank you.
So, because what happens to you is that, if all this has convinced me, in this moment, you have a slightly uncomfortable operation at the same time, and, in this moment, you have a slightly uncontrolled movement, in the aggress, that is a little bit of touch, a little, a little bit, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, and a little, a little, a little, that has a little, that has a little, and a little, and a little, that has a little, that has been replicated, that has a little, and a little, and a little, and a little, and a little, that has a little, that has a little, that has a little, that has a little, and it's, and it's, and a little, and a little, and a lot of a lot of life that has a lot of attention, and a lot of life, and a little, and a little, that has a little, that has a little, and a lot of life that has a little, a lot, a lot, and a little, a little,
Because if you're not going to talk about a medical group, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor, some of you want to raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting that you talk about the best relationship, it's time for us to think that we're passive, and it's passive, and we have to take our hands to be passive, for those who are at our heart process.
So, there's no very good thing: if you give me the chance to accompany your doctor's information, if you're talking to your doctor, you're a very important film, and I need to know that the difference that, in that occasion, when you talk to your doctor, there's a very important film, there's a lot, and there's a lot of information, there's a lot of information, and there's a lot of information, it's a lot of information, a lot of information, a lot, a lot of public, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of public, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, and a lot, and a lot, a lot, and a lot, and a lot, a lot, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, a lot, and a lot, a lot, and a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of good,
This magic that I'm trying to say is that at that moment the magic has happened, that individual has all the interests of taking care of it, at that moment we're talking about, I have a very proud thought culture, and there's a doctor to tend to a protocol in ambulance.
We, doctors, can try to find more unity in our treatment, more compassionate, and all patients, the crisis of not doing, because of a connection.
Thirty and five,000, today, people want to talk to you about a story that changed the biggest way we reach one of the decisions that changed my way of making decisions, and the interesting thing is that, for this group of people, a digital structure has been chosen as digital, as well as those of institutors.
I learned a lot about this because I started to ask myself why I studied this situation in the middle, and it seems a little bigger than the use of the other, and I'd like to study the tourist, because I have a lot of money to influence people who choose the option to have, in this moment, and we see that they are really well-being, and it's very well-being, and it's very difficult, and it's very uncomfortable, and it's very difficult, and it's a way they's a lot of the same way they's in the same way they're in the same way they're going to talk.
So, from these 35 million decisions that we have, it was at the same time, gathering this concept, with the concept of the Revist of Economics, which we've been working at the UFRJ, and, in a certain way, we've been fighting for this profession, and in a certain way, we've been able to bring it to the Fortal Reflexion Agenic Fortion Agenic Fortion Agency, which has a lot of Fortion, which has a lot of Fortion, and a lot of Fortion, and a lot of Fortion, which has a lot of Fortion, and a lot of Fortion, and a lot of Fortion, and a lot of Fortal GDP, and a lot of FL, and a lot of FL, and a lot of LPC, and a lot of research, and a lot of research, and a lot of research, and a lot of people who has a lot of COP, and a lot of COP, and a lot of research, and a lot of research, and a lot of people who has a lot
(Laughter) In this case, I was collecting credit in my cell phones, and then I opened Uber, I was there already marked, and I picked it up with other people, and then someone decided I wanted to go to the Uber's office and I didn't want to receive a cup, and a lady called TFO, and she said, "I don't want to leave." (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So, "Audience) So, "A few options, I't know, I't know, I'm a lot of options, I'm a lot of options, a lot of options, a lot of options, a lot of options, I'm a lot of senses, I'm a lot, I'm a lot, I'm a lot of trouble, I'm a lot of humbly, I'm a lot of trouble, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm a lot of humbly, I'm going
(Laughter) So, Marcelandi said, "I don't realize how much..." (Laughter) So, actually, this is Google, it's Uber, in a few years, in English, in the economic economy, the behavior has also had the name, it's very interesting, that we have a book called "Donantes," and then, what I do, I'm going to ask you to ask you to give an appointment to the person's a little bit of the cell phone, it, "Well, it's a little." (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So, it's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit like this, it's very simple, it's very simple, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's a lot, it's very interesting, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot,
(Laughter) And in this talk, I'd like to take a picture, and it's important to see ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) So, this means that I keep all the decisions of life here, more than 400 people I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave, like, for example, in this text that you're going to take in your life, or you can use, to make a patient of diabetes, the danger, and this is that yes, that you're going to take a nickname. (Laughter)
So, from these 35,000 decisions, we'll be able to build a better world, and I believe that, as these incurbs work, we'll be able to build better interfaces, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, so that we make better decisions, thank you.
