It's like the residence of people with disabilities.
What if there's any difference?
Or should it have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue move so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to put clothes, does it need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
From then on, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took them to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made them lose the fall of the piece for a long time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist ...
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and obviously I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfortunate with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena, a blouse that was opening in the shoulders with pressure button, to facilitate, at the time, to pass the head, by the way, for people.
They're quadriplegics, the ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person and paraplegic.
that gives autonomy to be able to dress alone.
AC: In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disability.
And for Pate, I made a rehearsal.
A very ergonomic good, I've already done it in the sitting position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote the name of remembering him to identify that that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information, like the size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status, the ideal.
It's to think about pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, childhood sessions of the shops, imagine clothes with princesses and color.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and are producing more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs, stamped and more technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their schools.
Because it was already in the second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first, that the big companies, but it was out there, that the American brands recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
What about the world?
What's changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
What about my life?
(Laughter) The middle of the forest?
And it was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
I went to work with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it's going through an adult, "My community, I started working with Dio?"
And I was designing people, "How?
What about this?
Knowing how to separate one's trash.
So I tried to talk to the child and it was winning the parents' awareness.
The parents were catching.
GB: Do you deliver me to children?
People recognized me in the community, and I only studied until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege of a school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
Audience: Yes!
I do with the children I know.
In my community, we have one...
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
To work with this tree, we have a plant.
(Laughter) I met a plant called her name of Engar.
She's a luminous plant.
What we plant everything under it: it's a plant that recovers fast or soil.
Audience: And all the creative plants.
Below, we have a good result.
AC: And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
(Laughter) I met.
That all plants were used each one in their place.
AC: But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth, right?
(Laughter) So, do you have to imitate the forest?
(Laughter) Because there in the arm.
I had a lot of prag that was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Audience: Yes.
So I tried to plant them.
(Laughter) various: there I have the "Asaíu", the graviolla, Andiróba, Copaíba.
with Moru, Guaraná, and everything on the beach.
(Laughter) Before I eat, everything is natural, in my arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, very toxic.
I said, "Mom, bro.
(Laughter) And the fruit of there...
Five separation of ours: in our community, we work there, everything with organism.
AC: You eat everything natural.
AC: There's no toxic in our communities, OK?
(Laughter)
I said, "Can you buy your brother?"
Like an animal.
(Laughter) The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
(Laughter) You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children.
I said, "I'm paying and I'm coming to this tension."
Then he talks to the animal quote.
(Laughter) So, I compare the child like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
The biggest thing for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the eye, "My father says this.
AC: The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person.
Because I observed my house.
I was observing my house.
I stayed at my wife.
(Laughter) She always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, Mom."
So ...
I saw that all this with my work was doing with children.
What's the future?
(Laughter) It would work out.
And today, we have it.
It's a job inside.
It's far from the human being.
I sticked on the other hand when I started there.
It started in a thousand children, for those who don't know what's far from the human being?
It's the Amazon's tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river that's before.
I had a dam.
AC: In front of you.
But it's like this a little of our community.
(Laughter) And this hooligan disappeared and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
AC: Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're getting there.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
So I'm going to pass to this person.
AC: Today, when I talk about it...
The forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) Respire a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest?
(Laughter) It's always talking to people educating children.
"Yes."
And going through other people.
And I have a message to leave here a phrase that is very little, that I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, do people come to us?
Are we talking about it and allowing people?
And I'm very happy.
(Laughter)
I'm yours, if I don't go through it.
My message, my education for other people, I even feel guilty.
AC: Absolute and thank you very much, guys.
That's it.
I got married with a name, I had two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
It's also my family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
And to create this family: until two months ago, in the Sophie of Tancrède, or greater of 11 years, it was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
That's it.
It puts the life of the Enrice.
Imagine all the most guys you're here.
Like we don't feel this.
It's like a method that loses a suffering.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find out.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the other friends, "Wow!
They did a very big movement, divulging the press, social networks, everywhere, bringing people, touching blood, medulating.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was...
And when a child gives you leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
And we learned to be this lesson and it spread to our friends, to the most in school, to society, people in Facebook.
I'm talking about truth, it doesn't matter what problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
It was that people saw us as a homosexual, a parental man.
It's not a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
The important thing is to love the family, this union, this is to give the strength, that gives life, or a father of a mother to be in the family, or a living father, or a father of a mother to save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease to the world.
It's that my blood, my medule, anxiety, started to manufacture it.
Our favour.
The blood is only painful, it's a human being to donate for another human, so it's also upset, this consciousness, we don't have that ability.
To give blood to those who need it, and they know it's not that.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks are precise, and donating medula osse, driving as a medulator, the chances of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be able to wait for them to call me so that I can save my life without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to save them in my life, and that's just the same thing that happens to all of us."
So I thank you all.
Or supporting us for that union that we are not feeling, that support conditioned, is not to save life as big.
In other words, more for having that awareness that we can all do blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
Paz, stop you.
Be it like you.
This is the exhaustion.
Two slams.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Tama.
The Syrian capital.
In January, I studied at Damas' University.
Today I'm stuck in Brazil.
With my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
The Arabic is a bit...
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry!
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
Today.
And I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Broancetto," that exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A war church.
To be a beautiful, calm, cheap, and easy to live in the population.
It was 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew about this child, three dozens of clothes, obscultory, engineering, two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamas.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world, I went to the country.
AC: Like the United States.
SM: Spain.
AC: It's cold.
Until one day.
She started the war, March 15.
It's 2011.
I'll understand.
After that.
I say to all the other ideas.
From the country, my mask city.
It was the saferest of Syria, I had between 20 and 25 bombs.
Good morning.
"Go on!"
I'm five years of war.
Men and country are destroyed.
Let's see.
Those who know it were, thank you.
Carriga, Ocadapa.
Of their children, they found their wives.
Spread and mutilated.
"Well, a bomb."
Familiaries.
It will sound and not come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did I get out to work?
I know how to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian will be stuck, dead or refugee in other countries.
I'm my family.
And we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we, the relatives, and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
I stopped protecting my family, I went to Barabairote.
Hi!
Ten months.
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so on.
I went to talk in Baixada Brasileira and desert.
That São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil, because he had more opportunities.
And you saw Pinas, or more week, "Brazilian Brastrada."
For 40 years.
From my life?
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
I'm 11 years old.
It was like this: today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday, and everyone talked very well about the food my wife did.
And I'll take advantage of it.
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
And that's when I created Bagina no Facebook or Talal with my Syria, that's why now.
Everything has a pen and paper.
Because it's a number, it's the accumulation.
And I make food between them.
Boru WhatsApp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank.
The reception.
From the Brazilian people.
AC: You.
Open the pots.
When the world was closed.
(Audience) Good evening.
Etress, who is at the end of war and attacks.
I'm Togoris.
That's it.
That's it, guys.
I had a wrong idea.
It's about Ossirio.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow, here.
Or a journalist says, "Me?"
And then, what happened in France?
Now, I don't want to talk, talk.
The contact with a Muslim person.
Let's think!
I'd like blood.
That it's allowed to kill the name of religion.
AC: But exactly ...
Oops!
I said, "Hi, that's it!
What happened in Paris was a crime, not about French, but also Branuse.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of the slam.
A religion.
It's a base.
Or Alcuron, I'm not a sacred book, since he kills a person, without having killed it all the men and who gives them life.
It's as if I gave life to all men, to the corridor, to your mother, to see Polo, 30 years old.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there's no type of fight between the sky.
They are Brazilians, even with the differences of culture and religion.
When people come to a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, they ask me, "Why do you use this heat?"
AC: This lesson at home, OK?
In T-Jabi, there are other keys.
Men and women can't touch me, but each person wants to buy, or not, the debate also brings some things to be the same way they have crossed, that don't obey everything, but I've already seen some humans who do all that, except goods of marriage.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or CFC with more partner, what if it didn't happen to me?"
"Why?"
Because those things are exhausted from isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not getting to know Mozla, after the agency exhibits.
People always understand and respect, or "Mohamadez," that we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value we should have, truth with everyone.
It doesn't matter, black white people are saved.
And Indians, or slam Tabéndez, that we have to help the people who need, every year we have or Alsaacá and we give two,5 percent.
of all our money for people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystados, today.
And I invite you to learn more.
It's about O islam.
I'm sure it was August.
Now, it's understanding what a religion is.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
(English)
[A.DE.]
Or Bricocento.
That's how my children.
And it's your child.
Wow, power!
To grow together based on it.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, I do food, in the Sun of Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, I always say, "I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I've had a lot of hands, cook."
Fascinera.
Why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you put me so much to pay a secret course?
But who enters the office?
Opa, sorry, I committed an Eventric mistake, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas: please, give me an opportunity, and the lunch told me, "You follow this corridor, go back, go to the left, go to the left, enter that little room, that the vast is awake, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the Pagina's success, the page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 and this year still didn't complete four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was at home of vacation, due to everyday race, sometimes there's no time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live near the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a domestic employee.
And, as I use Facebook as a daily basis, I put everything that happens in my mother to be a maid, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid of domestics for seven years, and then I decided to share the things I've always been talking about in the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast, and then, soon after I put my first story: my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santo.
This, in 2009, I was hired to be a cook, and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I was doing, I couldn't use her body at home and not the bathroom.
In her house.
What was the domestic bathroom?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and that was always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last stories, and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to several media.
So much the international media, the national media, London babies, television and Germany, and many others.
What I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, Vía Skype, who all of them got excited, and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work, outside Brazil, has another symbolism, the most valued domestic domestics, they earn for hours, so totally different from our country, for example, an announcement I read.
It was for workers.
And to work as a second.
The assessment.
From 8 am.
At 18, winning 380 Brazilian reais per day, a week, much less, a month, 380 Brazilian reais, this is our condition here.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a gigantic library, and I always liked to read, but, books, even today, cost very expensive, there are domestic, spending for these oppressions, not being able to buy the books I wanted, and for my surprise, the Regina enters in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher in history since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
And to conveil the university.
With the gangs, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarize some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but it existed in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, and exhibited some stories.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
(Laughter) Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
MP: The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And that is it.
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman, why do I say it's the sedentary service, my grandmother?
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic.
When I arrived to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I was going to understand each other, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
(Laughter) Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum.
Without photos, they called me, at least, a interview, took a suspicious, and this later deformed, OK?
I took a dirt to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so, "Are you?"
I said, "Yes, or I'm magic."
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are the apartments of luxury today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She arrived.
I was running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for a long time for her to arrive, "You're on the beach day, I hear her entering the car, the barulinho of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came."
And then, when I get there, with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take your money, Monday Tipago."
The modern senior is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered was me who was there.
I only wanted to see, she married, that's it, but unfortunately they didn't invite me for marriage, but, as I'm daring, I put my best clothes in the church, I stayed there hidden, and I put my girl married.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
It's Christmas, I'm seeing my four-year-old family, everybody happy.
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work, it will work, it takes part.
His wife to work.
Tell him who's going to work, but he returns.
For the house.
To witness me.
And the only solution I had was to take copies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get into it.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can run away from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,800 Brazilian reais per month?"
"I'll win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children on the northeast, and they need this money.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot to save.
Because my little kitchen is my opinion.
And then I was there.
And in the service line, pressed, I picked my little bit of soviet.
And this is the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?"
Using the little pot of saving, using the bathroom, what's happening, not your bathroom can use, not because in other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought little.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee, "Today I'm here."
Unlike statistics.
For some people, in my place, I would be there in the faxine, because when I told my pattern, "I want to study."
Do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be happy where you are."
For this attention.
His grandfather wasn't domestic?
Only the mother wasn't domestic, she's already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda!
Great!
Seriously!
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and rage.
Oh, my side!
I'm not alone here today.
(Laughter) Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But just to see that six million domestic women are being represented now?
And many are not watching me, but I'll be able to watch these numbers, that they're cleaning, and that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone here must have several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking, and humanize the relationships, we'll decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, even this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why does the nanny know it's a nanny, but it's not to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country?
So I'm here and control in the United States.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million dolls.
It's one of the African Axias in every day.
Let's go!
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Take off your cell phone.
Not photographing, even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then, I was doing the 8th, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's follow.
And I was almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Take your eye, open your paup, and it's safe, put your equipment.
Spread inflammation points.
The first past of the dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this.
From this chaos, of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of present.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years in Militan, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
In this feeling, in this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation that you have in front of you.
"You're you."
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't believe, the X doesn't have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's in class.
And it was very frustrated.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know who lived a big mine.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the story of everything I had already lived.
And then, the discovery was everything I had already experienced.
That's it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act, I was determining people like I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you.
He only kept his gold.
I'm going to talk about many of you.
Think.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone because all of you have it.
"My daring."
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You sleigh, come this step.
It's not about getting rid of you, but slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then?
And you, backwards, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection: those who connect to the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back, look at the stage.
Then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at her in this way."
I said, "You're fine, get even a kiss."
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
What did you see?
(Making sounds using the lid) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that is born.
It's fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
I said, "No, Americans had it."
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
A strong direction sense?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at this moment, a different piece of mind of you is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the fifth chicle, and soon you learned that a little before your hand touches the chicken?
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a legal vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system to your minimum space.
What about volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What brings the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside, to explore silence.
It's realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
These are self-knowledge technologies that are in the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them.
So available, it's simple.
But it's the last generation technologies.
We already know that in the future, the evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never gone through a TED talk that has had the first video?
(Laughter) And, normally, it's the first view, as my case was, I can say that it's an absolutely tough evaluation.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translations ...
I'm from a demand of a legion in the end of the TEDx.
What did they understand to bring society?
In a shared way with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
(Video) Ricardo Chiara: In the case of your Brazil.
The work of translation is essential once it's worth it.
Five percent of people agree with the behavior of prediscity.
Five percent, at least, have English influence.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Actually.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's translated into 16 and young people.
(Video) And almost 6,6,000 translations made at the moment.
But we're only translated.
Like also transcended.
The talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx to the world, but to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk wasn't in English?
In my case here, I read Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be fertilized at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more beautiful.
Because, initially?
The TEDx, with its own looptype, indicates the ponds of subjects, entertainment, which is the "e" we can translate as entertainment.
We have, for example, and designing the Paulo referring to the talks based on an inferiority of subjects that go from the 70s about political, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature, talks, forms the works of science.
Another of my passions.
This year, what defines the subject is this eventually.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest life expectancy.
And also the reduction of human work's journey throughout people.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do in my ferventive recipe is to translate and transcribe as a bubble false in the NGO of DET.
The TEDx talks can be the TEDx talks, or the TV series are educational videos that can be successful until children in a small one.
And I do this not only.
Because translating is a passion, and the country is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks, whether it's a TEDx, or a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here the book that Trantor is a privileged sector, not only because a pleasure to translate these talks with me as a translator.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here to receive.
People stretching.
But why do I think my time is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence.
Audience: Yes.
In this archives, like this.
That's what I want.
Second, it was cold.
I opened the promise of a girlfriend.
Audience: Yes.
(Video) Raise your hand if you're here.
This is potentially because I don't have a doubt and education.
It's fundamental for them.
And I don't have a doubt, that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged, with good crime, the excluded to our society can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's a donation work, whether I donate if I have, whether I play your knowledge, to split an object.
And what if I work to volunteer?
Because, always, a choice is mine, a mine decision.
And I have to do it in the best way possible.
I tried to commit myself.
To donate the time that's left.
(Laughter) It's different to donate the works.
And the rest of the monsters.
The tradition is a complex activity that demands not only to know the foreign food, but mainly.
What about our life?
And it's already a picture.
What a young man!
It's a perfect translation.
(Laughter) There's always.
A dream of knowledge has been invested.
The world is research.
I said, "Mom, the job.
A lot of verticalations.
And, on the other hand, a fluent translation for Beixes?
There's always a degree that I've tasted.
And frustrated, with facts, what?
Because the best it makes us, he can always do it better.
Because the text can be improved almost in definition.
And here I need to remember.
That the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide.
Most of them.
But, despite this, we create the quality of our history.
(Applause) Not only in respect to the speaker, but without respect to those who work.
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
And they pass through a revision made by their own volunteers.
(Laughter) Finally, they would be approved by a coordinator or a language coordinator.
Or, as we call it, "Yes."
And in the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I said, "Stories."
We have Zai Penama, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
I have our parents.
And it's because of my nose, Gustavo.
The owner or the sun.
What's the guy doing?
The world is fine.
This obsession that I have with education?
PA: Isn't it?
(Audience) I'm a kid.
AC: Not only.
With Brazil.
That lives a deep, political crisis, that the education is connected to the bread, but without even my own personal story.
My father, who today was being two years old, got hurt for primary school.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study further because I was studying and make some studying children.
That's why the one who lived in our little kitchen called Tairobeiras.
He decided to change his four children at the time that I pay a lot of slides, the biggest city we live in.
In some sides, my father used to sell his start his logic to the Uberas, and his site also knew, as a commercial, he had a material of a presence store.
(Applause) At the moment.
In 1914, there was a great presence in Brazil.
(Laughter) After this reception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and lost absolutely everything, he became, literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in the cells.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his failure when my father decided to pay his degrees.
If changing for Belo Horizons as a cold behind, eating well liked to go.
The first horizon.
My mother, who today has been around 30 years old, isn't it?
Also, being a waiting for young people to stop and still today.
It was not knowing about cooking.
So, for many years in my house, wherever it was literally winning the channel, "Give this passing from the best peoples in permission."
So, even though we don't have to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing to my father in Adriama, that we're destroyed to study.
And that's how ...
(Laughter) That's it.
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the national research for samples and homicides.
In the faster of 48 years, at 68 years old in Brazil, only 32% of people with higher personality than 5%.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had for education, disappeared.
(Video) In the Menor Jas, my father, for example, had a very placed habit.
Understanding, when I was seven, at that time, we were going to college entrance exams.
And a vocalist begins, and at the beginning of a teacher, he has chosen a bubble, and in a few years he needs to be able to stay in jail.
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, he was hurting me, shaking, without knowing, he was having a little in this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than this today, we managed to give our children better conditions than we had, and here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life, in my opinion, are our beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
The ones I've never put this paper to my newspaper for me, but for those I've asked all the nights.
And about the stories of all of them?
This adventure was always a pleasure for me and four of my children.
Coincident that, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
At some point in physics.
(Laughter) And one of the brothers is the main educator for me, fantastic, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite our limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
Just like today, it was inspired by these wonderful speakers.
The TEDx inspires us.
And to spread the idea.
What makes us believe?
Think about what?
We can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where she can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where she explained how she worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then she taught us, "But it didn't work very well, because it's super complicated, I started to write the letters from this for a while, but when I returned my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threw me to the roots that I wrote to her, that I was still learning, gave me tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "maker" course in the "Cross" school, and we thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take it on the Internet, we'd be ready to connect with some pines, and we wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in Braille, to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
The whole process we spent met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help in the kitchen inclusion and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't even ended up in high school, we're second year and we're teenagers, we've managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Let's look at us.
Okay, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a motor exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
There's another part with an objective.
It must obtain pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men.
There are women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients.
In apartments, in hotels.
There are street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults that are correct.
The failure that involves us at 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are cases of crime.
These are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially.
I said, "Yes."
The delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual emertion.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer institution and forced institution.
And we're also not going to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
According to the depth of prostitution.
On the contrary, sexual exploration, but taking all the people who make prostitution for victims of sexual traffic, is confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
The investigations have shown that falls in Portugal.
The phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is little expressive, in fact, they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, that the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'll give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic, which is the State organism that changes the river, the information about human traffic issues.
And that there are relatively two thousand accesses, which are the last available data.
It indicates that they were Portugal confirmed 118 victims of traffic.
It's human.
What do you do for likely exploration?
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's just three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that it creates a whole speech and a half.
What are the results of reality?
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
I'm very happy.
It's structured.
What's waiting for someone?
I wanted salvae.
And this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economic inequalities.
There are social and cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of constraints.
That influenced the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when we meet.
Investigator, I interviewed conversations, I'm with the people who do sex work.
What they say is that they're an option, a standard option after the advantages.
And disadvantage that is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly witnessed and not recognized.
What if I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
Sure.
It's when you think of a person who prostitute yourself.
Think.
And I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one, or even in a woman.
It's a sort of bad aspect.
It's a ministry that's in a corner, in a dark street, in the city, which is very likely in the laboratory and that, of course, has someone exploring.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images.
That they don't reflect with rigor.
That's the reality.
There's a very big diversity.
There are people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Of practices, of experiences, not all of us have positive experiences, but not all of us have negative experiences.
And life trajectors are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made of fuel.
And the identity.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century.
Plete Saint-Drop.
What will it represent?
There are only 10 to 20% of the total of depositing people.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
Let's give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the NGOs preservation of Lisboa and that interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of the countryside, men, women, trans people.
And that, in all the country, found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
Forget it if it's a percentage of men who are.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
BP: Although it may appear.
It's an apparently humanist idea when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And what is the idea of the client's criminalization?
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
It's forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex.
The idea is at the base of this law.
It's where people who are in prostitution are victims.
Without exception and, therefore, if they're victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other countries, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-vernamental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they tell me that this law puts in greater rivers.
There are the own dry flavors who put rich people to know how to drive.
And that increases its vulnerability, the violence.
What about stigma?
It's the disease.
Another idea we have is that all people.
That this idea of all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Hmm...
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until research has shown that the relationships between workers of sex and clients.
They are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is dehumane.
They are people.
What are differences of disability or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through gender professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its security and its pleasure, and many of them can make it go through security professionals.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is assistant, sexually someone who receives to know how to have sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroys any argument that tries to be in favor of the crime of clients.
So, if people?
You can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think it's the best option in that moment of their life to make it easy.
There are their economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
It controls the connections of work if this can be done without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the one hand, has a sexuality and considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural.
And on the other hand, we have a security and it's considered illegitimate.
It's normal.
I said, "Anti-natural" and that's where the beginning of the sky is located.
The fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction, of disvaluation of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a brand with deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes, stigma is a form of violence.
It's at the base of so much discrimination about sex observers, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area of justice and social security, they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll tell you this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" followed women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a kind of lady's sphere that is above the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if they have a sexual behavior that is divided, the norms that are restricted socially.
So I took the puta stigma.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
It's so cool!
Why do I think we can do any of us?
It's so that they don't continue to disrespect blind founders.
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
To challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give you voice, to hear the sex workers.
I'm going to give you a group that has been.
There was something of the most attempt to see silencing throughout time.
The secret employees.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70, but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have credibility, they're not heard.
In other words, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
But after all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it was useful?
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
What about medicine?
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cured, art, healing at being a doctor.
It's supported by a fundamental stone, in the medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have such a distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and so that I can add the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship of our time, with all the most superficial and rare, I'm this balance, it's suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors who were also there in different areas.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
That's it.
I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
Banticular: I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer that person that involvement to that love, this attention there.
He's extrapolated.
Audience: Yes.
And this convention, the request of sweat and hours.
(Laughter)
All the doctors who go with us and go from there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
(Audience) Yes.
The simplification that occurs there can be replicated here too, it's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
It was the path I had to cover.
It's a study that moves.
At the beginning of the medical college, if you take a list of objective to the students, the first goals are there.
Altruism is fine.
And these same students.
At the end of the medical group, with the same research, the "top" of the succession.
Fearing, cure.
Some time we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant poet.
And we delivered someone in technical, who knows a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
That's it.
Audience: Yes.
The old relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back to the past.
(Audience talking) Nadres.
Because it's the weight, in medicine, where is the father, in medicine, which is the pop.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't made.
(Video) When I love it, I swallow the apple.
The Eva desengastated, and this was to make a loss air, it's what we do until today we don't touch the same thing.
So why is the address considered, instead, to define me, and why your father teaches me why for the first time?
He had a method there.
It can.
The art of courage, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And, in a way, the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion, it was also developed, it was created a Pope's isolation.
Because even today, it's used in medicine formature.
It was done in a state of 50 BC.
I'm a photographer.
Don't talk to me.
If you're in three words.
In all houses here.
I just talked about the benefit of the diseases.
Exiting all bad volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and beings.
That's it.
And they become respectful to the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
And if I respect this judgment and didn't hear it there.
It would be the title of equation between men and all the time, that I would share the violin that happens to me.
Why, already in that time, if you worry about this, and still today, you do the surgery?
Because we have to be transcribed, because the best patient's relationship is essential for good care, so that's it.
Today, few things are registered by the UN judgment, and, in this case, I've seen an honor to participate in a profession that is registered for a joke.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a individual.
It produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So today, a patient has a lot of doctors who take care of a class, and this class is taking care of a little piece with this, we're specializing a lot, encouraging this and losing the cure of the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group of small people, as a teacher.
And I tricked the patient's processes, I took graphs, resonance, and I understood how we copied the ultrason.
If I look for their hand in their belly, it's not in their faces of consciousness.
"Oh, I also have the composer, the guy calls me a lot, calls me everything and says, "Let's see the network."
That's it.
We had to tackle the patient's finger and removed what was smoking in front of us and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth time showed he had a magician.
The mothers on Earth.
It's crazy, you can see if it's building care.
It's a bit like the South Bigo, you can talk a lot about it, when you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that has, you can remember something that doesn't tell you about the consultation, and he says, "What if all of this should convince you?"
Besides, as you see in the patient.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, he's telling you to extend me.
And at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good, that you're asking him, leave the care of you.
This is the magic.
She's not just beautiful to say "yes" but she's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, who are appealed, improve, but they have a higher rival for precociously.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, but we don't know why it appears.
There's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no rivers, there's no symptom.
And what happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already told me this time.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and to be passive to those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk about a medical group.
Because, in the end, the act of relationship is not merce.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two areas.
There are the doctors against the two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, that was in our curve process, but also by developing your curve process in the decisions of this curve process.
Let's do it.
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
The difference is that, in that occasion, in order to convince someone to publish something, a editor, to have content to say, "Today, a group, you have a very important lesson, but, in a very good way, and we need to know, to filter the ability to generate information is greater than the result."
So, there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
So, the mouse really liked it.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1 or 3% of people inside my curriculum, but I know who I am, and this gives me a huge chat because people get there, because they allow me for nothing to study bad, because this put me in equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, and selling media or other things like this.
So, the second very important thing: the information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, hardly, a conscious laboratory, will have a immediate discovery, without scientific society, doesn't be matured, it't do time.
Third, if you have a paranoid color, like the industry doesn't have any interest in you, it's worth it.
You're downwhelmed, dominate information.
It's hardly someone with interests and exclusions behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president, and finally.
Take the solution, discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information is a knowledge knowledge, takes information, participate in your cure, information is a knowledge.
The second very important thing to be active in a process of cure is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know who you receive that medicine.
If there's a right to know the risk of that surgery, you can't say, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to understand me, I work 20 years."
I know it's time, but I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture of it.
To exist is not to get there fighting with everyone, it's not a teacher, it's not that.
(Laughter) Please, OK?
There is, composing with time, we'll go.
And to make the atendments be different.
The doctors want it.
They want to have money.
They don't want to have this attempt, like the name now, they want to have with chaos.
Once I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, she was a mountain, a human area.
And we had a patient there, that he had a full cancer.
It's with humor.
Let's see.
And there wasn't any orologist, so we brought them to São Paulo to be treated in the field's attitude.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, it was still, I didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor, who obviously didn't speak Germany, had a translator, was the son, who said very good at Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was really comfortable, and I presented a enjoy that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the biomedical, you know this.
Yeah!
That's it.
The doctor was there.
Thank you.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
That indifferent?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interests to take care of him.
This magic, which is the art of going to cure, so it doesn't need to behave a lot, it happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking, and there are doctors waiting for teachers, which are anonymous, few, in ambulants, in consultants.
I'm doing it.
That's it.
By cutting the good fight.
Right?
It's understanding.
That's it.
What about us, right?
We can try to find more unity in our most compassion treatment and all patients.
Try to be active in your cure process, because you don't do it, because there's a connection, and the world is better, and you'll be more disappointed.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I wanted to start with the world here: 35,000.
What are you doing in this environment?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being drinks every day.
And if it gives more or less a decision every two seconds.
There's a person.
Two: they wake up of making a decision for those who want to be satisfied with this talk.
The decision-making talk I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my evolution of making decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this record.
CMS: The racing of the journalist had three emotions of this nature.
It's a digital nature with 59 dolls.
A journalist's structure prizes the citizens' brain that has a slightly digital treatment, but printed by being a citizen.
The respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how entrepreneurs are.
What I really like with these experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
For the second group, it was only two options.
GB: Gital Motion, 58 workers.
And the evolution of how 22 institutors too.
And very interesting is that for this group of people, most of this, I looked at a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to ask you, "What's the notion of the middle of 16,000 moths of printed election?"
No one chose it.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in the egg?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
With what I wanted more to dance, I would make this decision.
I started to study about this, I studied a lot of prejudice, and I discovered that this person is seeing and even a man.
She looked at me and said,
It's a song that is placed in an equation to influence the state of a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
I created a little interesting form, you can see.
I had just been one or two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the option T.
You already know the same to see the past.
AC: This is the third e-mail of her, "Take a look like this, it's better for what I'm going to pay 100 to 25 dollars."
AC: Our company, if I can have two at the same time.
And this is impressive because I started questioning myself why I did everything.
And a talk that, even from TED, made me understand all this.
(Video) My name is Ana, he's doing a comparison.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
I think everyone appears in the countryside.
Silvio Azuldois appears a little bigger than the south of the sidewalk.
Are you ready?
Because I have return to what we see in a different way.
We're going to give birth to our stomach.
But we see that it involves a different way because it involves two influences.
And there's another periodic use that I was fascinated by listening, which is this one.
The hope is to need the cradle on top.
They are equal to low chess pieces.
(Video) Narrator: Is it the same life that you're going to do with the problem, before you review everything?
But I'll show you what it is.
Without addicating the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, it's better to understand that it makes some sense to say that it has returns to us, it really evolves, it has to influence the door we see, the two.
What has returned to the brain is the whole decision.
I work in technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an application through safety.
He said, "That's what you wanted to do."
It's a lot of option and life will not be available.
You can choose these two options, these three, or these two.
And it's not true, I'm sure.
Because we were working, but they said 500 km of possibility of choice.
The work team was working and putting a way of sacrifying this choice to people, this way was to have another profession, if the person was in the orchestra, she would add these three options.
If the person wants to believe me, he wants to see these three options.
It was, at the same time, fighting for the concept of the Church journalist.
I've just realized that there are people.
What they make the drawing of the architecture of decisions today is the other year of decisions.
And this led me a lot of lesson in the world of technology, which is even the name of this profession, called YOEX, which is exactly the people who are the architects of decisions, and the investors or the experience of the territory, working in the decision-making, all formed and the environments in all these areas.
As incredible as it seems, my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this one of her is the person who has to bring the knowledge of the behavior economy to the digital world, and he's super fascinated that he's going to talk to you about Rio Grande do Sul, and he's going to have a power with Denary.
I really wanted to change my review and see it as a result.
She think we don't need much research to know that we use a lot of cell phones, that everyone lives in the third larvae, or outside the dust, or looks at him, but she came to a research in the company that was very difficult.
AC: If you have some people who have a smartphone, there's something like 22 hours a foot.
It's necessary to lose you with your advice, and there's a mood.
So, in these 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think are digital decisions?
Cities are going to be Egyptian Egyptors, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TM, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TM, €TMs, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TM, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs, €TMs,
I started to ask myself all this.
Is it that when I come to this horizon and eat a person, I enter the classroom of this lesion like me?
Is all of us going to change the path story we're going to talk about, and we put the "wes" and we say, "We're going to have a mask, and what's this genius?"
AC: How many decisions do we treat by dealing with power?
For us, a digital need for Google is Google.
We need electricity.
Speaking of drugs, I'm going to talk to you about another year.
It's a wall in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata, it's Ecuador do C.
As you can see, I started to think about this and say, "Where are you going to have books?"
Thank you.
(Laughter) It's not strange.
(Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two pieces of work.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, because in Austria you're already a teenager?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Dinabarca, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magic word that calls "defol".
This word is what you're already.
I don't have to do anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to get out.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and there are two options: one provided the principles.
And another allowed me to receive.
(Audience) Yes.
The recipes were dismartened, the offers were killed.
So someone decided I wanted a party and I didn't want to receive, so I went there and went to leave.
What to get out of the offer's mark and the recipe mark.
Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the cube.
This is the "no" I asked him to leave, if I was really in the people and until then.
I thought it's cool to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take the work they love to talk.
And then, a Uber track tells me a story.
Here's a lady.
I chose a culprit.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage here?"
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose the cube."
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, little by little, I chose to be without even knowing.
She chose what she was already chosen for her.
Isn't it?
It's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
AC: If we go to Google today to research today as a person, there are 567,000 results.
What's the energy we click?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and the same was Google?
After that, what I do: I'll read the click on the scene.
I love Perfect, I see from there because there's peace, "I'm not going to the page."
Just to ask for it.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
AC: These English and English have a name in the behavior economy and its name, they are called "dinities."
Not that it's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy in the person next to you, yes, don't realize anything to do.
That's a little bit old.
So, this is the nickname: Is there a theory?
He has a book called "The Bridge Teller."
And the concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, in a simple way, to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "I thought it's crazy.
(Laughter) In this talk, I created a picture, and it was important to see.
AC: You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austria and Detina Már.
AC: Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
(Laughter) This e-mail had a text.
I've written, "Although you're writing in a TEDx of a person, you're automatically taking power of all your decisions that you'll take in your life."
(Laughter) "Shut up!"
The house you don't want to be too low, you have to stay in this link and ask for it to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
There are more than 400 people written.
There were 13 people who stayed in January.
So, this means that I consume all the decisions of life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, this is an experiment, according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I show the results.
Genome is people who ask the Fabio?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Doctors.
And this can make us manipulate, right?
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
As, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it to do what someone buys something she doesn't need, or you can say to the good, leave the moment, it serves the insulinest life.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the section of the brain waves to detect a seed.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, I know there's a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
AC: There's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine it was?
Pokémon Go's budget.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual learning, machine learning.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe it.
Who we know how to better understand?
And how do these schools work, how do these snows work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We'll be able to build better interfaces.
And we went to lose more consciousness.
To make us make better decisions, thank you.
