Have you ever thought about it?
Do you want to think?
It's like the residuary of people with disabilities.
If there's any difference.
My role as a fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, or should have people with and without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue move so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to put clothes, does it need someone's help?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
From then on, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took them to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made them lose their fall of the piece for a long time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work of these conversations, the conclusion I arrived ...
It was this: making clothes is that this vestuary was really necessary, and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the ceinture to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfortunate with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person, and for paraplegics, that gives autonomy to the person to dress alone.
AC: In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disability.
And for Patty, I made a very ergonomic seat, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote the name of remembering him to identify that that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal, the ideal, would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information, like the size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status, the ideal.
It's to think about pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, childhood sessions of the shops, and colorful clothes.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs, stamped and are producing more technological products.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
(Laughter) And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
Drika.
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their schools.
And it was already in the second inclusive collection, due to the size of success that was the first, but it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who also realized the reality of this college recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about this, we must have empathy, look at others.
(Laughter) The world?
It's changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences, thank you very much.
That's it.
And married with a name, I have two wonderful children who were raised thanks to two women who helped us in California.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the largest 11-year-old, was diagnosed with a very grateful family, those women who helped us make this dream and create this family.
And that puts life on the rhythm.
Imagine all the most siblings you're here, as we feel.
Like a fear of losing your child.
And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find out.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of method, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible, because all the more schools and all the larger friends, making medule, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, the first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was...
And when a child speaks of leukemia and tries of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
And we learned to be this lesson and it spread to our friends, to the most of the school, to society, people in Facebook, saying, "It's true, it doesn't matter the problem I had."
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, the fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
But it was that people saw us as a homosexual, a parental man.
(Laughter) It's not a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a mother divorced from the war, or important, I love the family, this is the union, this is what gives the strength, this is what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease to the world.
It's that my blood, my anxiety, started to manufacture them, our manufacture.
The blood succeeded, it's a human being to donate blood for those who need it, and they know it's not just for someone who has cancer in blood, blood is necessary in births.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks are precise, and donating medula osse, driving as a medulator, the chances of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to be called so that I can save in my life, if I don't give a part of me, to be able to save in my life, and that's only the great message that happens to all of us."
I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that awareness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
Please stand up.
That's it.
Be it like you.
This is the exhaustion.
Two slams.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Damasco, Syria capital.
In January, I studied at Damas' University.
And today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little from the Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Broancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A war church.
The beer was beautiful, calm, cheap, and easy to live in the population.
What I knew about this child was 23 million people, and I had my family, friends, two apartments.
I was a car in Damasco and I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to the country.
AC: Like the United States.
Spanish and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15, 2011 in Draa.
After that.
I say to all the other cities of the country, my mask city was the safer one in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
"Geee!
Of five years of war, or my country is destroyed.
People who didn't know were forced to carry, or shake their children, found their pregnant wives and mutilated by a bomb.
The relatives disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian knocked everything, I and my family were very sad when we had to leave Syria because our relatives and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
I stopped protecting my family, I went to Barabai Ruti.
(Laughter) After ten months.
It's about that Brazil had opened the doors for Syrian, so I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city to go to Brazil, because it had more opportunities.
And I had a pen or a week to knock back 40 years.
From my life, I started again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like this: today I have a Brazilian daughter.
A Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate, and everyone talked very well, the food my wife did was to take advantage of.
Who is the kitchen?
Very well.
And making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook page, "Hey, Síria, that's why now everything has a pen and paper.
Because it's a number, it's the accumulation.
And I do food in delivery.
Boru WhatsApp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank.
The reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened the pots.
When the world was closed.
Branus, Etress, who, on the other hand, is of attack.
I'm a tourist.
Many people.
I had a wrong idea.
It's about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says to me, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a Muslim person."
Let's think!
I'd like blood.
It's allowed to kill the name of religion.
But exactly the opposite, the attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the sovereign French, but also Branuse.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization, the Syrian, that is being associated with the image of Islam, a base religion, or something that kills a person and how it kills all men, to all men, to your mother, towards the 30th grade.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims, they kill sound Muslims, like me.
And my life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between Brazilians and Brazilians, even with religious cultures.
When some people tell me, "Don't worry, I'm not allowed to eat or not, because you use excellence with this heat, you use the silencing at home, but it's about each person to want all that they drink, embrace, embrace, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the sun."
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or be a sex with more than a partner, what if it didn't happen to me?"
"Why?"
(Laughter) Because those things are exhausted from isolation.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after the agency explains, it understands respect, our religion is very important for us, the teacher Mohamadez, that we all have the same value we should have with everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians, or it's so far that we have to help the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystados, today.
And I invite you to learn more.
It's about O islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil, the world knows the best Islam.
KP: That's it.
Let's do it with "O-brecocent."
Thus, my children.
And it's your child.
Valbuder, grow, together in base.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, I always say, "I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I've had a lot of hands, cook."
"Fashineira, why not hire me in the mall?" I don't understand if it was for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the mouth told me, "You follow this corridor, go back, go back to the left, go to the left, go to the left, enter that the little room, that the mall is just waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the domestic success, the page I created in Facebook.
The page came up in July 2016 and, as I created this landscape, it wasn't programmed at all, I was at home, from vacuum, due to the day to day, sometimes not even time to think and see everything we've achieved in life, so I took one day, in the middle of my dream, to live near the beach, and today I live near the beach, almost in front of the beach.
And, remembering everything I achieved, I also came to the memory of when I was a maid for seven years, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind, because I was a maid, I couldn't use the glass in her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
Narrator: What was the domestic bathroom?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and that was always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last stories and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails relating these stories, because the domestic work out of Brazil has another symbolism, BBC of London, the TV of Germany, and several others, I give interviews to several stories, for example, a announcement I read.
It was for the worker.
And working as a second, access.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of all that I always did, and I entered a gigantic library, and I've always liked to read, but, even today, there are domestic, spending for these conditions, not being able to use the bathroom, and suffering all the region in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher in history since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
And for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of letting up the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was resolved, no, I had to pay the month, and, thanks to some teachers and different friends of class, I prefer to enter the room to make prove that it's still not over.
Today, I'm here to generate discomfort, because I believe that only through the discomfort of domestic workers, and it was known by the media of the time as a terror of the patterns, all this, when I come here today, I come here, and I sponsor some stories, and people say, "Wow, it's very he's very heavy."
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
AC: This service can't be edited to black woman, why do I say that sereditary service, my grandmother was domestic?
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I was also ready.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum.
Without photos, they called me, at least, a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this, and that's it, and then you're yourself, yes, or I'm magical.
(Laughter)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are the apartments of luxury today.
What domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She came running, running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for a long time to get there, "You're on the side of the payment, I listened there, entering the car, the noise of the key, opening the door, my pattern came.
And then, when I arrive, with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take your money, Monday Tipago."
The modern senior is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I created it since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend, and I'd suffer, I'd only want to see her married, "I'm this, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage, because I'm having fun, everyone happy."
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little box of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work, it will work, it takes his wife to work.
Tell it to his wife who's going to work, but he returns.
For the house.
To welcome me, and the only solution I had was to take copies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get into it.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can run away from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, do you get 1,800 Brazilian reais per month?"
I'll win this value in another place, and I'm here resisting, because I also left my children on the northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala ...
It's the little box of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of saving.
Because my little pot is my penic.
And then I was there.
And in the service line, pressed, I picked my little bit of soviet.
And this was the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if the bathroom is happening, your bathroom can use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee for that I brought little?"
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee, today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be happy where you are."
For this attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, only the mother was also a domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics: black woman.
Gorda.
Great!
Seriously!
Mulher Professora Borda, Peripérica Iraq, my side.
I'm not alone here today.
(Laughter) Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do would happen that my life is not thinking about money that we don't have money, but only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, because in other countries, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we will decrease a little bit of some people in this country.
So I'm here in the statistics, I'm not doing it.
I'm talking about six million dolls.
It's where African African Axias is unforgetted.
Narrator: Goal!
Invisible, the air in the wind.
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny from the exit.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Take off your cell phone.
Not photographing, even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then, I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's do it?
And I was almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Take your eye, open your paup, it's safe, put your equipment.
Spread the inflammation points, the first past to mix.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos, of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "The silencing is the entrance door for a state of present.
When did I remember that?
And after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
In this feeling, in this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're the human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, what I found.
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know that I lived with a big mine.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the story of everything I had already lived.
And then, the discovery was everything I had already experienced.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act, I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you.
He only stood his gold.
I'll give you many of you.
Think, I don't need it.
So now, I'd like to justify the importance of it, so now I'd like to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone because everyone has it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone.
And they delegate him.
You sleigh, come this step.
It's not to get rid of you, it's to slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
(Laughter) And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
"Stern of connection," who connects the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back to the stage.
Then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at her in this way."
I said, "You're fine, get even a kiss."
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
(Making sounds using the lid) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born from fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
It's a fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
A strong direction sense?
There's a knowledge, you know where you're.
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at this moment, a different piece of mind of you is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the fifth chicken, and soon you learned that a little before the hand touched the chicken, and then you felt the temperature and took fingers to the Chicra's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the system of connected vocalization and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply the space localization system to your minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
(Laughter) It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence is to realize that much of what we do is determined by what we've already seen.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
A habit in our lives is self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available are simple.
But it's the last generation technologies.
We already know that in the future, communication will be from the evolution of race, direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never gone through a TED talk that has had the first video?
(Laughter) And, normally, it's the first view, as my case was, I can say that it's an absolutely tough betrayal.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of a legion of ideas.
who asked for the translations of a shared area with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
(Video) (English) In the case of your Brazil.
The work of translation is essential once it's worth it.
Five percent of people agree with the development of protesting the sound.
And, at least, 5% of influence in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Actually.
We are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's been translated to 16 and young people, and almost 6,000 translations made at that moment.
(Laughter) But we're only translated.
As we also see the talks made in events or facts here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx around the world, but it compares to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk isn't given in English, my case was very Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be fertilized at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more beautiful.
Because, initially?
Now, the talks add to an inferiority of subjects that go from this event about the political and business, entrepreneurship, even literature, we have, for example, the TEDx with its own indigenous logo, addressed subjects, and forms of smell.
And another of my ambitions.
This year, what defines the subject is this event.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest life expectancy.
(Laughter) It's also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think the fact that one of the uses I do in my productive recipe is to translate, analyze and transcribe, as a bubble, talks in an environment that can be the "self-profit" pieces.
And I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks, whether it's a TEDx, or a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and that I remember that Trantor is a privileged mentor, not only because a pleasure to translate these talks with me as a translator.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here at this event.
Inspiring people, but why do I think my time is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence in active initiatives like this one, that roots.
Second, it was cold.
I opened the promise of man in life.
Audience: Yes.
I'm from light to silencing and become something that is potentially empowered, that I don't have a doubt and education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I don't have a doubt, that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged, with good criminals, or excluded to our society, can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's a donation work, whether I donate if I have, whether I play your knowledge, to sweat an object.
(Laughter) Just because you're a volunteer job because you're a choice of mine, a mine decision.
And I have to do it in the best possible way and have to commit myself.
To donate the time that a sobra is different from donating the sobres.
And the rest of our time.
The tradition is a complex activity that remains not only to know the foreign food, but mainly our world.
And it's called "Fones," with young people.
On the contrary of a perfect translation, there's always a dream of knowledge in the middle.
What a lot of research?
(Laughter) A lot of work.
There are many vetications.
And behind such a fluent translation for the elderly beans, there's always a degree that I've tasted.
And frustrated, with facts, what?
Because better than it makes us, he can always do it better.
Because the text can be improved almost in definitions.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
But, despite this, we create the quality of our history.
(Applause) Not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who talk.
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers, so they will finally be approved by a coordinator or a coal coordinator.
Or, as we call it, "Yes."
And in the case of Brazil, in the Brazilian Portuguese Portuguese, we got Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
We have Zai Penama, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
We have our parents who are out of my nose, Gustavo.
(Laughter) The owner, or the sun.
What's the guy doing?
(Audience): The world is fine.
This obsession that I have with education?
(Video) Narrator: In half, she's a kid.
Not only with Brazil, who lives a deep, political crisis, that the education is connected to the top of the bread, but without even my own personal story.
My father, who today was being two years old, got hurt for primary course.
(Laughter) Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study further because I was studying and make some studying children.
(Laughter) That's why the one who lived in our little kitchen called Tairobeiras.
(Laughter) He decided to change his four children at the time, I pay a lot of slides, the biggest city we live in.
In some sides, my father used to sell his start his logic to the Uberas, and his site also knew, as a commercial, he had a small material of a presence store.
(Applause) At the moment.
In 1964, there was a great presence in Brazil, due to this reception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and lost absolutely everything, he entered, without anything, that I've been killed in the cells.
One felt as humiliated as if I paid for the name of my father, and decided, after paying his degrees, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold lady behind, eating well liked to go.
I have one of my horizons.
My mother, who, today, is 90 years old, isn't it?
(Laughter) Besides being an asteroid for Paráid Games, there are still eight jokes.
It wasn't an excellent cooker, a warning warning wedding supported, and she decided to do a ticket to sell, so for many years, in my house, wherever it was literally gained from the worst periodision.
So, even though we don't have to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing, my father and I didn't give up, it was that we were destroyed to study.
And so it was done.
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the national research for samples and homicides.
In the faster of 48 years, at 68 years old in Brazil, only 32% of the largest insolarity in 5%.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared.
In the Middle Ages, my father, for example, had a very placed habit.
(Laughter) As a foot, when I was seven years old, at that time, we were going to college in September, a place where each one thought, "I asked for my newspaper, I came to the class, and for any visit to appear without a car.
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, he was checking me, shaking, without knowing, he was training a little to this talk here, anyway.
I did the question of all the nights of the stories before all, but we got more than this today, we managed to give our children better conditions than the ones we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my opinion, which are my children's dreams.
Coincident that, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
In some point of life, and one of my brothers is the most important educator for me, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies in the education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite our limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiative is a TEDx, just like my father was a simple manager, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us.
(Laughter) To spread the idea.
What makes us believe?
Think about everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, which is a little girl who allows me to write in Braille, where she explained how she worked, showed the letters, the numbers and the symbols, and I started to write the letters from a while, because it was super complicated, and I started to write to her that I was still learning, and gave me some tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Cross School," and we thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, to learn about robotics and programming, and we started to research, but we wrote everything, disconnected and recognized everything, and we started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we ended the clock, and we showed the hours and minutes in Braille, to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
The whole process we spent met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we see that something that was born from our interest could help in our aunt and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't even ended up in high school, we're second, and we're teenagers, we've managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help for everyone.
Thank you.
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Let's look at us.
Okay, we're all agree.
That's it.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is a expression I prefer to use, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercial dance, is that there's a motor exchange, that is, there's a part that has sexual relationship with the objective to have a pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients, apartments, hotels.
There are street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve us 16, or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially.
And the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual emertion.
And even in the case of the Constitution of Dults, which is forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, we're not going to talk about sex traffic situations.
The tendency to confuse that by situation, against sexual exploration, is to confuse a small part.
It was as if it were all.
Investigations have shown that Portugal falls, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, that in Portugal the phenomenon is not possible, I'll give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic, which is the State organism that changes the river, the information about human traffic issues.
And that there are relatively two thousand accesses, which are the last available data.
It indicates that they were Portugal confirmed 118 human victims of traffic.
What do you do for lip exploration?
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's just three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that it creates a whole speech and a half.
What are the results of reality?
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
I'm very happy.
It's explored that they're waiting for someone.
I wanted salvae.
And this doesn't correspond to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim and consider that they make an option.
Of course, we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate economic inequality.
There are social and cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of contradictions that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I find an investigator, I interview conversations, I'm with people who do sexual work, what they say is that they're an option, a pondrated option after disadvantage, which is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
What if I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
Sure.
That's when you think of a person who prostitute yourself.
Think.
And I bet most of you thought of two situations, or in any previous one, or even in a woman.
It's a sort of bad aspect.
It's true and decreases that are in a corner, in a dark street of the city, which is very likely in the operating boat and that, of course, has someone exploring, but this is only two stereotypes: they are simple images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sex work.
There's a diversity of people.
Depratics, experiences, inside positive experiences, not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone sound on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made substance.
And the Western society.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are in the beginning of the century tell us that the perception of the street.
What will it represent?
There are only 10 to 20% of the total of depositing people.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
We're already studying the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by Lisboa's preservation and that interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of the street, as in the countryside, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
Don't forget if it's a percentage of men who are.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
And, although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed, deep down, because it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And what is the idea of the client's criminalization?
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
It's forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex, the idea that's at the base of this law.
It's where people who are in prostitution are victims.
Without exception and, therefore, if they're victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other countries, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, namely the non-vernamental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they tell me that this law puts in greater rhythm.
There are the own knowledgeers of sex, the rich people can know about sex, and that increases the sustainability of violence.
There's the stigma and the disease.
Another idea we have is that all people.
That this idea of all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Hmm...
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until research has shown that relationships between workers of sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of criminalizing clients, is dehuman.
They are the people who are the carriers of disability or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who go back to gender professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its security and its pleasure, and many of them can make sure professional go through it.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is assistant, sexually, is someone who receives to know how to have sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroys any argument that tries to be in favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people?
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them, it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
It controls the connections of work if this can be done without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically sexual moral, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the one hand, has a sexuality and considered legitimate, normal and natural.
And on the other hand, we have a sexy truth and considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural, and that's where the south begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction, of disvaluation of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a brand with deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong and has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
It's at the base of so much discrimination about sex observers, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area of justice and social security, they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" followed women in two types: tied and tired, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta is an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a kind of lady's sword that is above the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if they have a sexual behavior that is divided, the norms that are sexually restricted.
The freedom of being stigmatized by puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
I can be called puta.
It's so cool.
Why do I think we can do any of us?
(Laughter) So that they don't continue to disrespect blind founders.
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to the most distant silencing throughout time: sex workers.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70, but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have credibility, they're not heard.
In other words, we don't want compassion or tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
But after all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it makes sense?
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
It's medicine to the moon.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Art, well cured art, cured from being a doctor, is supported by a fundamental piece, in the medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can add the best treatment for those who don't divide me.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship with our poverty as a surgeon, in these trips that I accompanied many doctors who were also there in different areas.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
It's a white invitation, I thought I'd take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
That involvement, that love, this attention there, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood, to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer to that person.
And I said, "This convention, the request of indigenous, or ordinary.
All the doctors that go with us and steps from there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
The simplification that runs there can be replicated here too, it's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon, that's all this, it's the path I found to cover.
We have a study that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you make a list of objective to the students, the first objectives are: altruism, to have good.
These same students, at the end of the medical group, with the same research, the tops of the succession: knowledge, cure.
Some time we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant poet.
And we delivered someone in technical, who knows a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
That's it.
The relationship with the oldest relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back to the past, in Greece.
Because it's the weight in medicine, where the father is, the medicine, what's the pop.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't done before, when Adão, in Gasboa Maçã, Eva desengastated this, was to make a loss air, it's what we do until today I don't touch the same thing.
So why is it because it grows considered, instead, to define me, and little father teaches me why for the first time?
He had a method there.
It can.
It's an art of courage, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And, in a way, the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion, it was also developed, it was created a poca isolation.
Because even today, it's used in medicine formature for the world.
It was made a 7.5 B.C., a photographer.
I'm going to talk to my classmates, you've prepared three words.
In all the houses that entered.
I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of the children and of the brains.
That's why what they saw, respecting the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
Because it has to be transcribed, because the best patient's relationship is essential for the cure, if I respect this judgment and not violating, to be ethical of returning from men in all times, and if the transgender has a man's honor to participate in a profession that is registered for a giant.
The medical knowledge in Greece, an individual produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that provided in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical team that takes care of this class, and this class is taking care of the patient.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class at college, at a small group, as a teacher.
I jumped with teachers like this: "Look, patients have thomography, resonance, enthusiasm, and when we copy the ultrason, I put the hand in their belly, I don't make a consciousness, "Oh, I also compost it, we'll see the whole network, so we call the class."
That's it.
We had to tackle the patient's finger and noticed that he was smoking inside and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth time showed he had emagressed.
But these maps are crazy, you can see if it's taking care of your own clothes, the dark bigo can say a lot, "Oh, when you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that has to be, if it's all about convincing."
Besides, as you're seeing, patient.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're telling you to extend me.
And at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good, that you're asking him, leave the care of you.
This relationship is this magic, it's not just beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
And children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, are appealed, they improve the fastest and have a higher highest route.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, a house where we don't know why it appears.
I don't have exam operation, I don't have Einstein's interactions, I don't see anything, the diseases have symptoms.
And what happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you must raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's relationship, I'm a patient, and to be passive for those who are at least for me."
Because we'll talk about this for a group of doctors, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two areas.
There are the doctors, the doors.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, and it's not only in our heart process, but also in developing your cure process, in the decisions of this curve process.
Let's do it.
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
There's no content to say, "Today, a Google, you have a very important lesson, but, in a very important way, for you to convince someone to publish something that's a publisher, to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the result of filter, so there are some things that we have to be very good information, very good, very good, very good, and very good, and very good, and we need to do.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but I know who I am, that gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I did, and they allow me for nothing to be bad, because this put me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, and sell media or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: it doesn't believe the scientific things won't be maturing this for a long time, the information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's something that discovered tomorrow, it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry, there's no interest that you're taking this, it's hard to have some other with interests behind it, so these things don't stop, it's not for us, it's for the last.
Take the information, discuss your doctor, he's there for this information in the same knowledge, but discuss your cure.
Second very important thing to be active in the nation of the process of cure is to ask, to exist, when you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know which risk of that surgery, in a way you say, "Oh, in a public hospital, the guy has no time to understand me, I work 20 years."
I know it's time, but I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture to exist, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in the teacher, it's not this, it's slowly to know.
There is, if composing with time, we'll make the atendments be different.
The doctors want this, they don't want to be tried at the same time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, she was in Montoniosis, in her area, and we had a patient there, who had cancer.
It's humor.
And there wasn't any ideologist, so we brought São Paulo to be treated here in the field.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, it was still, I didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor, who obviously didn't speak Germany, had a translator, was the son who spoke very good at Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was supported, and I presented a enjoy that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the biomedical, you know this.
"Oh, that's it."
The doctor said, "Dad.
(Audience) Yes.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interests to take care of him.
This magic, which is the art of letting go, so you don't need to tell a lot of figure, it happens.
At that moment, we say, "I have the pride of thought that there's a doctor to attend in prototypes, in ambulants, in consultants, and so, anonymous."
Making a gluten of the good student, curating, understanding, so, we, doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our most compassion treatment and all patients.
Try to be active in your cure process, because it's not doing, because of a connection, and the world will be better, and you'll be more disappointed about it.
Hello, guys.
I'd like to start with a world here: 35, what did you give to the scientist's office?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being takes every two seconds, and it gives more or less a decision every two seconds.
There are two people who don't stop making a decision, for those who have been prepared to talk about this.
The decision-making talk I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my way of making decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with this journalist Ricorans, the racines of the journalist had three innovations in this nature.
It's a digital nature with 59 dolls.
A representative of the Revistant presents the Civil Center of a Digital Astrature, but also Service Estudores.
The respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how they are the main ones.
What I really like with these experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
(Video) For the second group, it was only two options.
Narrator: Gital Motion, 58 workers.
And we're talking about how the residents too.
And very interesting is that for this group of people, most of that, I looked at a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to ask you, "What's the notion of the middle of 165 dolls of printed evolution?"
No one chose it.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in the egg?
And this left me very uncomfortable, because I wanted to dance and I took this decision, I studied a lot about this, and I started studying all this, and I started studying it until the name, it was called Tikore.
It's a song that is placed in an equation to influence the issue of a decision or another.
And I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
I'll have a little interesting way, you can see.
But, if you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the option T, you already know the least to see in the occasion, this option is a bit of it, it makes the idea to be better, for what I'll pay between 25 dollars.
AC: Our company, if I like to have two, at the same time.
And this is the impression, because I started to ask myself why I did all this.
And a talk that, by the way, made the Internet all over, was a talk that made a comparison.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
I think everyone appears in the countryside.
The CEO of Azudoras Eids looks a little bigger than the south of the sidewalk, agree?
Because I have back to what we see in a different way, but we see it in a different way, because I have the return of influencing, the truth is that it's in the same size, which is this one.
The hope is to need the cradle on top.
They are equal to low chess pieces.
At that moment, we said, "There's the problem in the Atlantic Ocean, but I'll show you what it is.
Without the affection of the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
When I see this presentation, it's better to understand that it makes some sense to say that it has return to us, it gives the same way that it has returned, influences the door we see in the decisions.
I work in technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an application through safety.
It's a lot of option and it's difficult to think about it.
You can choose two options, the stars or these two, and it will never be safe.
Because we were working, but they said 500 km of possibility of choice.
And the team I was working was good for a way of sacrifying this choice to people, this way was to have another profession, if the person was in the orchestra, she would add these three options, if the person was in the microchemistry and see these three options.
That's when, together with the concept of the Church journal, I ended up realizing that there were people.
What they do is draw the architecture of decisions, where I work with decisions.
In the World of Economics, there's even a name for this profession, called YOEX, but it's exactly people and the Researchers or the experience of the website work in the architecture of the decision designing all formed and environments in all decisions.
That's why I came to my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this guy from ERL, he's the person who has to bring the behavior knowledge to the digital world, and he's super fascinated that he's going to talk to you, and produces a lot of my grandfather, and we'll come back to the behavior.
I think we need a lot of research to know that we use a lot of cell phones, that everyone lives in the third larvae, dust, or look at him, but it was a research in Brazil that was very difficult.
AC: If you have some people who have a smartphone, they stay with this smartphone for 22 hours, nearby.
It's necessary for you to lose, and for you to think about it, there's a new one.
So, from these 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think are these digital decisions, these universities will be if we were using digital food or that the medication sometimes took these numbers in the world?
I'll start to ask myself about this: Is it that when I go to this horizon and eat a person, I take a lesson like me?
And we put Wesi, "Are we going to change the story of the path we're going to take, will it be cold that starts to say, "No, that's the Wesi that doesn't add this circuit?"
(Laughter) With both the decisions we're trying to deal with the power for the digital world as we do, it's Google.
We need electricity.
Talents in Douber, I should talk to you about another interesting thing: it's a number in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata, it's 4% - I'm going to ask you to think it was this, and say, "Oh, the number is distributed."
Thank you.
(Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two pieces of work.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, because in Austria you're already a teenager?"
You need to ask to leave.
So, there's a magical word that's called "deflow," this word is what you're already, in Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to get out.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and there are two options: one provided the principles.
And the other allows me to receive offer.
The recipes were dismartened to the offers and they were killed.
So someone decided I wanted a party and I didn't want to go there and go to the website.
I went out, took off the offer and marked the recipe.
Uber has a new functionality, a pupa, you can share the car with other people, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take Uber that year, I thought it's cool to know another person, I opened Uber, I was there and I got a time and told a story.
And one lady chose the culprit.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked strange and said, "You're like this, there's another passage in the car, and he looked at him and said, "I've chosen the cube."
So, little by little, I chose to be without even knowing.
(Laughter) She chose what she was already chosen by her.
So, this is very complicated, it's very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
AC: If we're in Google today to research today as a person, there are 567,000 results.
What is it that we click?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and the same was Google?
After that, what I do, I'll go and click on the website.
I love Perfect, I see from there what parents don't go to the right page and clip.
So I decided to go on.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
AC: These English and English have a name in the behavior economy and its name, they are called "innatis."
Not that it's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to give an information to the person next to you, "Don't realize what you're doing, you're a little ecology, you're a cell phone, there's a theory.
He has a book called "Britteira," he has a book called "Donante."
And the concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, in a simple way, to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood, I thought it's the adults."
(Laughter) And in this talk, I created a picture, and it's important to see.
AC: You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austria and Detina Mar.
AC: Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
In this way that a text written, "Aus inscribes, TEDx de uma pessoa, you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life," (Laughter) "Aw does it explain?"
If you don't want to give up, it's enough to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
(Laughter) More than 400 people inscribed, 13 people stayed there.
(Laughter) So, this means that I consume all the decisions of life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, this is one of the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave, and I show other results.
Genome is people who ask their fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Doctors.
And this can make us manipulate, right?
And my answer is yes.
The danger says that yes, knowledge is a tool.
As, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it to do with a patient of diabetes, or you can use it for good, leave the moment, it serves even more harmful.
Or you can use the brain waves to detect the truck accidents, like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the medition of the brain waves to detect a crop to edit a accident.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, there's an event that happened in 2016, that made people in the world leave 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine it was like that?
And Pokémon Go's budget.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual learning, machine learning.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better how these problems work, how these nails work, we will be able to build a better world, we will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware for us to make better decisions, thank you.
