Have you ever thought about how people's visuality is?
If there's a difference, or it should have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces all people with and without disability, today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why does this issue move so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of course, and one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does this dress have a difficulty to put clothes, does it need someone's help or is it interested in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
So, many times, they bought a clothes, one, two larger numbers, to understand the implications and limitations of the play, and they told me that all of them had interest in fashion, for women who attended their needs, because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work in these conversations, the conclusion I arrived was that this vestuary was really necessary and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was to Juliana.
Elastic in the ceinture to give greater comfort, was from one in a desfile with other women without disability, and I did it with a high-pitched cause to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt that, instead of buttons, I put a veil to facilitate the dress of the piece spirit, and in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs that were offered by the apellium with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in the back, because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with other without disability, in fact, for people who are quadriplegics, the ideal, is to think of a vestuary and for paraplegics that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities, and for pattern, I made a very ergonomic salt, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top of below, under top, reversible, and I wrote the name of Alembraille to be able to identify that that piece would be that weight on the day of the desfile.
Imagine clothes with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, the Ide Kelle, the pianism, or the lowest status, the ideal is to think of childhood pieces and colorful pieces.
(Laughter) It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped and more technological products.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana, and I took the second place?
"I."
Silvana.
[A.DE.]
Adrika.
And many other people, several other stylists, but it was out there that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who were already launched the second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their collections.
We all have to think about this, we must have empathy, look at others, the world is changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences, thank you very much.
I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children who were created thanks to two women who helped us in California to create these children, who are very proud of us, my family and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
And that puts life on the laugh.
Imagine all the most siblings you're here, as we feel, as a fear of losing your child.
And we had two options: we could fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, strength, and continue looking for an ossy to find it.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of method, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible, because all the more schools and all the larger friends, making medule, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, the first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message was...
That when a child has leukemia and tries of life, all the rest of the problems of fears, concerns don't matter, everything else doesn't really matter, and that doesn't really matter, or the most important thing is life, the fight for life and love.
And the second message he happened with this disease, the science of compatibility between a donor and a patient, is that my blood, my medula ossia, so I thank all of you, or two women, to have this awareness, to make a family, or a father of a mother, for someone who has cancer.
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, we are not going to save life as credit, but for having that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
Paz, for you.
The base is like you.
This is Soundation, two slams.
My name is Paula del Chinaud, "So Syrian was born in Damasco, Syrian capital."
And, in gender, I studied at Damasco's university, today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little from the Portuguese.
That's it.
(Laughter) But that's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: British, that exists on the slam because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with Slam.
Before the war, friends I knew about this child, I had my family, barata, and easy to live the population of 23 million people, two apartments.
I was a car in Damasco and I liked traveling.
Until one day, my mask city was the saferest of Syria, started the war, 15th, March 2011, and I loved to know the world, after, I arrived at all the other cities of the country, moved in France, in Syria, it was very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian, I and my family were very sad when we had to leave Syria, and after ten months, I had opened the doors for Syrian, my father and my brother were still very sad, and I don't know if I were able to return to my country, because I had more opportunities.
And I had a pen or a week to leave behind 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, from the food that my wife did was to talk very well in Brazil, Brazil, Brazil of my children, and everyone talked very well, two Orial children, 11 years old, I was to take advantage of the kitchen very well.
And making food to sell was then that I created the Facebook Bagina on Facebook, "Hotalalalalalalade" with Syria, that's why now everything has a paper and paper, but the number... (Laughter) I'm in the food of Syria.
And I make food and deliver to Tiboruatzado.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank.
The reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, Etrest, who, by the war and terrorist attacks.
Many people had an wrong idea about Syrian and Islam today, tomorrow, here, or a journalist says, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a Muslim person, think I'm using blood taste.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the sovereign of French people, but also Banuz, which is being associated with the image of Islam, a religion of Bas, or Bos, not the sacred book, which kills a person, without it being allowed to kill in the name of religion, but also in the past 30 years.
Men and women can't touch my wife, they ask me how, because you use this heat, you use the silencing as me, don't wait well, I'm not allowed to live in peace, they don't respect the Muslims, but I've already seen the Muslims who do all this, even with the cold cold cold cold cold colors.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or be a sex with more partner, what if it didn't happen to me?"
(Laughter) Why are those saved things of the slam?
Lanta Béndez, that we must respect all the religions that all of us have the same value we must have, with all of us, doesn't matter if there are white people, black or indigenous people.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims or crystals today.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm a better Islam, I'm sure it was Augustá to understand that a garbage of basis, now my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows its children.
Valbuder grows together based on the cell phone.
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, because I don't hire myself in the mall, I don't understand, and if you put me here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I have a lot of hands, cook, faxine, and I always wait for the mouth to take a bathroom and take a bathroom.
After this moment, when I compasted this year, it wasn't even programmed, I was at home from Facebook, and, as I did this year, I still didn't fulfill four months, but there was a day when I thought that my last job was to use the cup for seven years, and then I decided to compost all that I achieved in the first story of domestic release, and I was in 2016.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but, even today, I've been very expensive, I've started to cry, there's a lot of domestic, spending several times in the world, and I started to study, and I said, "What I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've always found, I've been doing, I've been talking about what I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, in 200 years, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been doing, I've been a few books, I've been a lot of course, I've been a lot of course, I've been trying to read, I've been a lot of course, I've been trying to read, I've been trying to read, I've been trying to read, I've been working
And for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of advancing the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was resolved, no, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and different friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
Today, I'm here to generate discomfort, because I believe that only through the discomfort of domestic situations, and it was known by the media of the time, as a terror of the patterns, all this, when I come here, and I sponsor some stories, people say, "Wow, it's very he's very heavy."
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to talk to my mother, who would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good appearance photo is also black here in Brazil, and 79% of domestic population is also black.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, then they called me at least a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this, and that's it, and then you, yes, or I'm magical.
(Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are logical apartments, which were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not far away, it's very close to us, it's the owner of the employee.
She came running, and I was nervous, because I was waiting for her to get there, if she's full of payment, and when I get there, I've already entered the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came," it's the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I created it since I was a little girl, with so much elderly, and I knocked a sadness, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, it's Christmas, I'm seeing my family of my dress, everyone happy, and I put my best clothes in the church, I stayed there, I only wanted to see her house, because it's Christmas, and I didn't invite me to work.
He talks to his wife who's going to work, but he returns home.
To welcome me, and the only solution I had was to take copies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you won 1,800 Brazilian reais per month, you'll never win this value in another place, and I'll be here resisting, because I also leave my children in northeast, and they need this money, because the bottle of soap."
Because my little poetry of Sorvette is my Pinico, and then I was there, in this area of service, pressed, I picked my little pot of sovet and made this number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the bathroom to use, not because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that I brought little, because the modern senzala is the little box, today I'm here, contrary to statistics?
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)
(Applause) (Cheers) My side is Caírete, a woman for Professor and Caírete.
(Applause) I'm not here today, behind me, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
So I'm here telling you that my life is not thinking about money that we don't have money, but only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that at some point they'll be there, because everyone should have several patterns, many patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking to TEDx and women.
(Applause) Sound Africans and unforgettable.
Invisible, the air in the wind, the air in the wind.
(Applause)
(Applause) I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect, to switch your cell phones, don't photograph, even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago, I was in a table, in a surgical center, and then I was doing eight, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When the cell started, I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop, he turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's do it?
And I was almost 30 years old, I meditated more than 20 from the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
That's it.
It opens the word, it turns the word, it's safe, it puts the equipment.
Spread the inflammation points, the first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said, "The silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence."
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When I put foot inside this feeling, of this moment of presence, which is the moment when you are not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're your human potential.
When I put my hair inside, guys, if you're a human being, you don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have secret, you don't have sex, what I found.
It was fear.
It was a lot less, it was a lot of anger, and it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions, that I didn't know who lived a lot of me, they were the consequence of the story of everything I had experienced.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced was determining the way I thought, the way I act, the way I realized life was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone, remember?
Most of you?
He only kept his gold.
I'll tell you many of you.
Think, I don't need it.
So now, I want others to justify the importance of him, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone because everyone has it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
(Sigh) "Take a leg, come this step."
Don't be close to you, unleash your cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor ...
(Audience) Yes.
(Laughter) And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you the external connection tool that connects to the human being.
Now, look at the stage, look back, look back, look at the ceiling, look at this environment where you are.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at her in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss.
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are, come?
(Making sounds using the lid) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes, put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born from fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's a real fear of what's inside, a fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Remember the ceiling, remember the walls, remember the approximate dimensions in the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system of the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at this moment, a different piece of mind of you is scending.
Knowing where you are, leaving the localization system, feel where you are, sitting on the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the hot chicken to feel, there's also a knowledge, and soon you learned that a little before the hand touched the chicken.
Now, with the system of connected vocalization and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply the space location system to your minimum space: volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not difficult, it's not difficult, it's new, it's new, it's new, it's new, there's nothing weird here.
(Laughter) It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence is to realize that much of what we do is determined by what we've already seen.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
We already know that, in the future of the evolution of the race, the direct communication between what I feel, are simple, and a state of presence that decorates it and that can become the last 10,000 years.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection, in fact, happens when you communicate authenticity to another authenticity: silence is a source of freedom.
Tedxte.
The one who has never been passionate about a TED talk, who has had the first video, (Laughter) which is normally the first view, as it was my case, I can say, is an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of a formula of TEDx, that asked for translations in a shared way with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
Audience: Yes!
In the case of Brazil, the work of translation is fundamental, once only 5% of the people according to the supermarket budget are, 5% or less, have influence in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world, 10% of them are Brazilians.
We've been translating to 116 young people and almost 6,000 translations made at that moment, but we're not only translated as facts here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx around the world, but it compares to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk is not given in English, in my case, I wanted to read in Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Invertheless, the web with our own logic indicates, add up to subjects, we have, for example, an inferiority of subjects about the political, businesses, in vereorism, even literature, talks, and forms the works of smell.
Another of my passions, letting what defines the subject is this inventive accident, that time we have, then we don't only depend on our biggest life expectation as the reduction of human work at the long time of history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do in my productive recipe can be the TEDx talks, the TEDx talks, the TEDx talks, or the TV series, not only because I learn a lot with them, and that I remember that the translator is a better time for clouds, and that happens to me as a translator.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here at this event, because I think it's worth using my hearing accident in initiatives like this one, that hotel.
(Applause)
The second dangerous one was the cold.
I opened the permission of man in life.
It's ... to give light to fear and become what is empowerment, that I don't have a doubt of education, it's fundamental for that.
And I also don't have a doubt that education is fundamental for people, less privileged, with good crime, or excluded to our society, can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I think about volunteer work, I think it's a work of donation, whether I donate if I have, whether I work for your knowledge, if I choose mine, a mine decision.
(Video) I have to do it in the best way possible and try to commit myself.
To donate the time that the sobra is different to donate the soil, the rest of our time, the condition of complex activity that remains not only to know the foreign food, the deep fight, or mainly our Moon.
And it's called "Fones," it works like this.
Through a perfect translation, there's always a knowledge that shows research, a lot of work, many vertical hours.
In contrast with such a fluent translation for us to see, there's always a degree that I've enjoyed and frustrated with the facts of what?
(Laughter) Even better what we do, he can always do better.
(Laughter) Because the text can be improved almost in definition, and here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
But, despite this, we create for the quality of our translations, not only regarding the speaker, but in respect to those who invest, right?
(Laughter) And to guarantee this quality, all the translations and transcessions pass through a coordinator or a bar, or as we call it, "NC," in the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
Leixtories, we have the IPM, we have Maricene, Claudia, that I have our guys who are proud of, of my birth, liked the tone, or the tone, and the Rafael.
(Audience) OK.
This obsession I have with education, in fact, has to do not only with Brazil, which lives a deep political crisis in which education is connected to the second bread, but without even having my own personal story.
My father, who, today, had been two years old, who was living in a primary school course, even though he knew how to write very well and make the rooms in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond because he was studying and do his four children at the time for many plates, the biggest city that we sleep.
In a road, my father was the talk, and he lost absolutely everything, he was literally, without anything, because he killed in his beginning his logic of the library, and his site also established with a commission, he had a whiskers.
A lot felt as humiliated if I paid for my father's name, and decided, after paying his degrees, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold in front of me, eating well liked to go.
The first horizon.
My mother, who, today, has 90 years old, is in the 19th grade, besides being an asphere for the Parado Games, still today, for a while.
It wasn't a good cooking event, it was a warning warning warning warning wage, and it decided to make a ticket to sell for many years in my house, wherever it was literally gained from the worst stores.
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and I didn't give up, it was that we were destroyed to study.
And so it was done.
A big event without a doubt, because according to the data of the nursery research in the Parliamental Parliament of the 48 years at the 60s of Brazil, only 32% of people with greater insolarity than the fundamental one.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had for education, disappeared.
In the slightest days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself in foot when I was seven years old, at that time, we called the "Cabine Penns," when I asked my newspaper to go to him and to any visit that appeared at home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
Audience: Yes!
(Laughter) Anyway, today, I've been thinking that this should be the greatest pants of the park for me, but for those who, in my five siblings, we managed to study, we've been able to give our children all the names, and the ones I've never spoken about my biggest passion in my life, in my opinion, are my own children.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
Despite the limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has a priority inside our homes.
And my passion with initiative is a TEDx, just like my father was a simple manager, inspired us, just like today, inspired by these wonderful speakers, TEDx inspires us to spread ideas.
What they make us believe in what?
Think of everything.
And we can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where she can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, which is a little girl who allows me to write the letters from the first second year, and when we returned to the classes, I did a lot of times, and we discovered that we could create a clock, and we started to think about it, and we created a program that would take the motors, and we'd be very close to us, and we'd give them a lot, and we'd give them a lot of continued to the project, and we'd be able to create a bridge, and we'd be able to create a bridge, and we'd be able to create a lot of bridge.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from an interest in us could help with a new language, all support, values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, show us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create, with this we are committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help people's applause.
Good afternoon.
Let me ask you a question: What do you think?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
They can't go to the manual.
OK, we're all in agreement, two or more adults, in a free and consent way, can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in the sexual work, which is a expression that prefers, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships with term objective, and the other part with the objective to obtain pleasure, men and women, who generate their business in apartments, in hortheres, or even in street pensions, and who don't have any color.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual empression.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is also a sexual exploration case, is to confuse a small part as if it were all.
The investigations have shown that Portugal falls Portugal the phenomenon of traffic for sexual exploitation is few possible, in fact they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, that in Portugal, the information is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks, human, almost all for extreme exploration.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution, but often people take all the people who are in prostitution as victims.
I'm very happy.
Stories that are waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype, most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim and consider that they make an option.
Of course, we know that not all of us have the same options, the inequalities between rich and poor countries that make sexual inequality, what they say is that there's a decision-making option, but when we talk, the world is extremely unfair, there are structural constraints, like gender inequality, and it's not recognized.
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who prostitute you?
Think.
(Laughter) And I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any pretium, or in a woman of bad aspect and mining, who is in a corner, in a dark street of the city, which is very likely to beaten and that, of course, has someone exploring, but this is just two stereotypes.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people, of practices, of experiences, inside positive experiences, not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories, they're not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, not only women driving, there are also many women of sex work, for example, when our image is equipped with when we think about prostitution.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made of existential societies and try to stimulate the number of people who are in the beginning of the century tell us that the perception of the street.
What will it represent only about 20% of the total of depositing people?
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
They're less, they're minority, but they're not mechanical, we've studied the data of the study that was made in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a free study, men, women, trans people, and that, in all the country, found 10.2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of women drive, and there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
Since 1999, the idea that people who are victims are victims of a oppressor or a client, so we will criminalize their behavior, but they have seen humanist evidences when they are analyzed by the bottom of perceived by very negative consequences for the people who do sexual work, and that is the idea of criminalization of the client.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are victims.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because investigations have shown that relationships between workers of sex and clients are complex relationships, and that mostly these ideas happen with functional diversity or other types of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go to sex professionals.
So, if people who have disability, who are already in favor of the criminalization of clients, there are even countries that have the legal figure that has the sexual assistant, which is quite clear about sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work and their pleasure, and many of them can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence, normal, anti-natural and sexual, and natural, that divides sexuality sexuality into two types, if this can be done with control over the connections of work, why do we continue to disrespect the workers of sex?
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is based on the description of the decrease of humanization, the stigma, it's a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination on sex observers, it's very strong in many consequences: stigmatization and social security.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, honestly, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma is the worst that can fall on a woman."
The worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" and women in two types: "The honors" and the "feminine sexual sexuality" is a kind of smoke behavior that is divided, the norms that are restricted socially, correct the stigmas of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do I think we can do any of us to do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators, and I think the path is one of human rights, of all included by ideological assumptions?
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been able to hear the sex workers, give voice to a group that has been, so for everyone, organized by the 70s, but we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have decided.
But after all this.
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex knowledge.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
The medicine is fine.
But having the good news too, we can cure it.
But at the same time, I have to give a very delicate distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, artic, well cured in the doctor's relationship, to have a technical judgment, and to accompany many doctors too, in this relationship, a very delicate relationship.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white avoidance, I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian said goodbye.
That involvement, that love, this attention that was supposed to manipulate, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer me to that person.
All the doctors who go with us and go from there, in Rockey, and we bring to São Paulo, who brings us to the daily practice here.
The simplification that runs there can be replicated here too, it's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon, that's all this, it's the path I found to cover.
We have a study that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you make a list of objective to the students, the first objectives are: altruism, to have good.
Someone, when we did it wrong, that we got someone who had a brilliant study with the same research at the end of the medical group, cure, poetic assistance, and we delivered someone technical with poetic, who knows a lot of medicine and doesn't know anything about people.
The concern, with the oldest relationship in medicine, where the father, the medicine that is pop, doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before, when the airplane dropped the apple, it's what we even do today, it doesn't touch the same thing.
So why does the church consider, instead of medicine, and its father teaches me why for the first time, he has a method?
In that occasion, it was developed, it was created a logic, an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replied, and in a way that was created in a pop training.
Because even today, it's used in medicine formature, in the world, it was done in a 7th grade of Christ, people in a picture, please.
I'm going to talk to the media, and you've prepared three words here.
In all the houses that entered, I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of the children and of the brains.
That's why what they saw, respecting the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
Because it has to be transcribed because the patient's relationship is essential for the cure, because, already in the collection of this judgment and not violating, it's ethical to reject the men in all times, and if the transgender has a man's honor to participate in a profession that revolves me.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a very incurate individual, and it will lose all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical team that produces science in a way that the teacher could go further, and what happened with this, the knowledge, the doctor, that provides science in a way that the next one could go further.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group of small groups, as a teacher, we're going to see the whole network, and we're going to see the whole network, and when we copy the contraction, I put the hand in their belly, I'm doing a lot of consciousness.
He looked at Bigo Sujo, he could say a lot, "Oh, at the time you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy, he can see if he's taking care of his own dog, he didn't smoke anymore, he't smoke anything, he didn't tell you, and said, "If everything happens to convince you."
Besides, when you're seeing the patient, you're here exposing to consider the vulnerable area, you're telling you to fill me, and at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "Don't see him, you're really well, you're taking care of you."
This relationship, this magic, increases the number of functional diseases in our middle, the same functional functions, but we don't know why it appears, there's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no chestnutch, there's no chest, it's a better apple, and it has a more precocious ratio, children, children, and it's a Christmas, because our society is a little slowly.
Because if you're not going to talk about a group of media, some of you want to raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's relationship, I'm a patient, and to be passive for those who are at least for me, because the act of the relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two aspects.
There are my doctors against two, it's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, which was in our curve process, but also to develop your cure process, in the decisions of this curve process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information, where we're talking about Doctor Hugo, which is fashionable, when it was a child, there was a very important exhibition, there was a very important information lesson, but, in a very important way, the difference that, in that occasion, there was a book, a lot of information.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1 or 3% of people inside my curriculum, but you know who I am, and this gives me a huge chat because people get there because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, selling media or other things like this.
So, the industry doesn't have to want you to leave this, and, for the last, it takes information, participate in your purchasing, so there's no way to discover today, tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know: "Well, third, if there's a paranoid laboratory, with conscious interest, and immediate, without scientific things, it doesn't have a mature."
According to the very important thing to be born in a certain process, it's to ask, exist, if, as it's not this, it's slowly to know, when you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know that risk in that surgery, there's no right to know that there's a public hospital, a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to answer.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, she was a mountain, a man, who we had a patient there, who had cancer, who had humor.
And there wasn't any ideologist, so we brought them to São Paulo to be treated in the future of cancer in Uber.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his transcription, I had a very good Portuguese translator, as I was very bad, he was really not talking about Portuguese, the doctor who obviously didn't talk about Germany, and I presented a conflict that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, for the doctor, is like this: "Ana, breastfeeding, the sea was breastfeeding."
(Laughter) The big deal is that at that moment, the magic happened to that individual without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture than that other individual, this magic that wants to take care of it, so it doesn't need to be very hard, it happens.
At that moment, we're talking about, I have an urge to think, and it's medium to tend to look for anonymous in open consultation, we can have patients, but to find more unity in our treatment, to be active in their facial process, and the world will be better, and you'll be more well treated.
Folks, folks, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my way of making decisions, (Laughter) I'd like to start with a woman: 35, 5,000 Brazilian reais, this number is the number, and if it gives more or less a decision every two seconds, and it's a person, two, to need to pay attention to the 59 dollars.
A journalist's narrative prizes the CFV in citizens, the respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how to digitalize the price as well as individuals.
What I like many experiments is that they usually believe in two groups for a second group, only two options were released.
A digital option, 50 workers, and we're talking about how the institutors are.
And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them have chosen a digital option.
When I talk about the experiments, I believe that this option changed most people's lives in pain.
This observation has two options to the idea: to influence this autonomous person in a decision or another, and you want people to choose the option T, you already know the same thing in education, and I learned a lot about this in a cognitive theory, and neuroscience applied to the tomato of decisions, and I started to influence what I'll pay between institutors.
And this is impressive because I started to ask myself why this is all, it was normally a comparison of these behaviors with today' use, and a talk that, even from TED has made me understand all this behavior.
Because I've come back to do what we see in a different way, but we see that it's a different way, because it has returned from influencing, and in fact, they're in the same size, which are equal to the previous and low levels.
It's at that moment that I look and say, "No, I have the problem in the Jetsons Rome, but I'll show you what it is."
Without addicating the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
In the work of technology, when I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes some sense to say that there's a way of simplicating this choice to people, if the person goes to the orange, it's going to create a training to see these three options.
That's when, together with the concept of the Chronese magazine, I ended up realizing that there are people who do the drawing of the decision-making architecture, where I work in my decisions.
And this caught my attention in the world of technology, and even the name of this profession, called YOEX, which is exactly the people and the Researchers or the experience of the websites, and are the architects of the decision, designing all formed and environments in all decisions.
AC: So, why did I look like my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this guy of RAL, he appealed that it's a guru in this behavior environmental economy, and he was super fascinated that he would start with you, and he changed a lot of my grandfather to come to the hospital?
So, from these 35,000 decisions we make, if it's better for the people who have the smartphone, they get a little bit like this, or that the path we'll give is a little bit of this: how many decisions we're doing, what we're going to study, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do.
Chorus: Here.
(Laughter) You need identity.
Talents of Rio Grande, I should talk to you about Portuguese for the best interesting: (Laughter) In this case, it's an Austria Muroquina, it's 91%, and in general, it's 4% - you'll see where it's from two to two.
When I became aware of this number, I asked myself, "Why do you have 99% of young people's pain, because in Austria, you need to ask to leave, in Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter, without doing anything, it's the decisions I call the birth, you have to go to leave?"
(Laughter) So, it's very complicated, it's very interesting that we imagine who was already chosen by Uber, there's a new functionality, there's a pupa, you can share the car with other people, and someone decided that I wanted to offer the recipes, and another to receive this name of going to leave, if I went to Uber, and even in the audience, (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So, (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So, she chose to choose to choose, without even knowing that I was already chosen, without even choosen, without even knowing, without even knowing it, it, it's very much, it's very much, it's very much, it's very much, it's very difficult for her, it, it's very complicated, it, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very complicated, it's very difficult for her, it's very simple,
What's the energy we click?
(Laughter) Ninety and one percent of people explain in a state of the first Google's first country, will those who chose a place we eat as a person were me, it was the same?
What I do, I'll go and click on the website, then I love the website, and I see from there what has the page "No, I'll go to the website, it's to ask this."
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
These little English taxes have a name in the behavior economy, they are called "innatis."
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "There's a book called Dutch, there's a cellphone, there's a simple way for us to understand these little bonds in the digital world, and the concept of saying, "I don't realize what the adult is."
(Laughter) But it's not true, and in this talk I've created a picture, it's important to see ... (Laughter)
Good afternoon.
In other words, one of the things I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave, (Laughter) If you're thinking that only those who fall into this link, more than four people in writing, even if you're automatically taking the power of all your decisions, that you're going to take in your life and ask them to leave.
Genome is that people ask me a target?
To have this knowledge of these discomforts, of these ages, can this do because we manipulate someone?
And my answer is that yes, as, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it, to do something it doesn't need, or you can say it to the good, to do with a patient of diabetes, the knowledge comes out at the moment, it serves more harmful.
Audience: Yes!
Or you can say, to avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the medition of the brain waves to detect a crop to edit a accident.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, there's an event that happened in 2016, that made people in the world grow 144 billion steps, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world, what you can imagine was: Pokémon Go.
Because Mongol is a game that brings the tone with the concept of increasing reality, and I believe that if we understand better how these nails work, we will be able to build a better world, and what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives, thank you.
