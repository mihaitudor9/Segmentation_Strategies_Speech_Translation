Have you ever thought about how people's visuality is?
If there's any difference?
Or should I have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, people with and without disability, today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why does this issue move so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of course, and one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to put clothes, does he need someone's help, or is he interested in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about it.
Then I did a study, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two larger numbers, took them to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made them lose their falls, because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work in these conversations, the conclusion I arrived was that this vestuary was really necessary, and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
I did it a cause with high-pitched, elastic in the ceinture to give greater comfort, which made a super discreet zip to be able to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with other without disability, in fact, to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will wear the person, and to give them autonomy, to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities, and to be part of an ergonomic good, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
For Jesel, who is visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top of the bottom, under the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him to be able to identify that that piece would be the user in the desfile day, by the ideal, and color of the piece.
"Ai de Kellei" has the same, and for women, with ananism or lowest status, the ideal.
Imagine clothes with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, the child's birth of the shops, the children of princess and the color of pink.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
Thank you.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped and more technological materials.
Did you know that in Brazil we had the first fashion contest in the world, which is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana, and I took the second place?
"Me?"
Silvana.
Adrika.
And many other people, several other stylists, brands, famous and conceptual brands, who were already launched the second inclusive collection, due to the size of success, which was the first, and the target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about this, we must have empathy, look at others, changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences, thank you very much.
That's it.
And married with a name, I have two wonderful children who were created thanks to two women who helped us make this dream true, to create this family, to generate these children, they are very proud, my family and very grateful, with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you are here, as we feel.
Like a fear of losing your child.
And we had two options: we could fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for an ossy to find it.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of method, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible, because all the more schools and all the larger friends, making medule, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, the first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message was...
That when a son of Teleucemia and life tries, all the rest of the problems of fears, concerns don't matter, everything else doesn't really matter, and that doesn't really matter, or the most important thing is life, the fight for life and love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
It was that people saw us as a family, or two women, or a father of a mother to make a family, or a living, homosexual, a parent, or a father of a family, this union, that gives the strength, that gives life that will save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease to the world.
So, if you have this ability to donate blood for those who need it, then you get up, or have this awareness, when you have an accident, at any moment, all of you will need it, and donate me from Laosia, if you can save it in life, without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me, for someone who has cancer.
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, we are not going to save life as credit, but for having that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
Please stand up.
The base is like you.
This is Soundation, two slams.
My name is Talola del Chinaui, "So Syrian was born in Damasco, Syrian capital."
I studied in Damasco's university, today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a little from the Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry!
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: Brutancetto, which exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
Before the war, friends were 23 million people, and I had my family: the beautiful, cheap, and easy to live, the population, two apartments.
I was a car in Damasco and I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15, 2011, and then.
I arrived at all the other city in the country, my mask city was the saferest in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Good morning, then.
My last years of war, or my country is destroyed, family, submissioned, and didn't vote in the series, were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, in millions of Syrian, we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, I still live there, and I still don't know if I'm going to be able to return to my country, my father and my brother, and I don't know if I live them again.
To protect my family, I went to Barabai Ruti, after ten months, I had opened the doors for Syrian, so I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city to go to Brazil, because I had more opportunities.
And I had just one week to leave behind 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like this: "A Sara, nine months."
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well about the food that my wife did was to take advantage of the very well-known kitchen.
And making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook page, "Hey, Syria," that's why now everything has a paper and paper, except a number, (Laughter) I'm in the community.
And I do food in delivery.
Boru WhatsApp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank.
The reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed, Etrest, who, by the war and terrorist attacks.
Many people had a wrong idea.
I think I'd like to go to France now and I don't want to talk to you about Syrian and Islam, or contact with a Muslim person today in the morning.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime in the so-called "Franceses," but also Banuz, which is being used to the image of the Islam, or the opposite, not the sacred book, which kills a person who is allowed to kill in the name of religion, but exactly the United States.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims, the Muslims, the only one, like me, my life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians, even with the differences of religion culture.
When people come to a woman using Ri Jabi, the debate also brings some things to be the same way in which the US doesn't obey everything, but I've already seen the humans who do all that, that they drink, embrace, kiss, kiss, kiss the other rules.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or be a sex with more partner, what if it didn't happen to me?"
(Laughter) Why are those wise things of the slam?
Today, it's very important that we must respect all the religions that all of us have the same value that we must have, in fact, with all of us, it doesn't matter if there are white, black and respect agencies.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims or crystals today.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis.
And now, my dream ...
This is the best Islam, my children here in Brazil, and that the world knows their children.
Valbuder, grow, together based on the cell phone.
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, I always say, "I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I've had a lot of hands, cook."
The faxineer, why not hire me in the mall, I don't understand if it was for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the mouth told me, "You follow this corridor, go back, go back to the left, go to the left, go to the left, enter that the little room, that the vast is just waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the domestic success, the page I created in Facebook.
From that moment on, when I compasted this year, I was still not fulfilled for four months, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken, I put everything that happens in my daily life, sometimes I didn't even have time to think and see all the stories of the past, so I got there one day, in the middle of my 24-year-old life, because I thought that I was to receive only a few stories of the story of the first story of my first story of the beach.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, a consumption of all that I always did, and I always liked reading, but, even today, there are domestic ones, going through these conditions, there are still no more than 4,000 Brazilian announces, and I received a lot of appointment when I started to talk about the most valuable domestic situations here in Brazil.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, I was nervous, maybe palida, I started to cry, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher of history, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and it was very difficult."
Consiling the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was resolved, no, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," because I believe that only through discomfort, in this world, a woman called Lal delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first Sindicato of the Domestics, all that we can change some things.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a job like any, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic, my grandmother was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I took a long time to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I was also ready.
When I understood this and started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me, at least, a interview, take a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, and that's it, and then you're yourself, yes, or I'm magical.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are logical apartments in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She came running, and I was nervous, because I was waiting for her to get there, if she's full of payment, and when I get there, I've already entered the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came," it's the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend, and I'd suffer, I'd only want to see her married, "I'm this, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage, because I't have fun, everyone happy."
And I knocked a sadness because it's Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala takes his wife to work.
He talks to his wife who's going to work, but he returns home.
To welcome me, and the only solution I had was to take part in all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get into it.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, you won 1800 Brazilian reais per month, you'll never win this value in another place, and I'll be here resisting, because I've also left my children in northeast, and they need this money, because the modern senzala."
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service, brought my little pot of saving.
Because my little potato of sorvete is my penic.
And then I was there, in the service line, pressed, picked my little bit of sovet and made this number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if the bathroom is happening, your bathroom can use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought little?"
Because the modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee, today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are."
For this attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, only the mother was also a domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda.
(Applause)
(Applause) Seriously!
(Applause) My side, Mulher Pressandra Gorda, Professora Peripérica Iraq.
I'm not alone here today.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do would happen that my life, not thinking about money we don't have money, but only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that, in other countries, many of them will take this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we will decrease a little bit of the patterns, many patterns, and some people in this country, so I'm here.
(Applause) Sound Africans and unforgetted.
One day, three, three, three, three, four.
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny about coming out.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect, to switch your cell phones.
And don't photograph, until I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago.
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then, I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling very painful.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop, he turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's follow.
And I was almost 30 years old, I meditated more than 20 from the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Take your eye, open your paup, it's safe, put your equipment.
I put the inflammation points, the first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this.
From this chaos, of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said, "The silencing is the entrance door to a state of presence."
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
This feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not inside the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not the anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're the human potential.
When I put my hair inside, guys, if you're a human being, you don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have secret, you don't have sex, what I found.
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It was in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
What I didn't know, that I lived a lot of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the story of everything I had already lived.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had lived, the way I was acting, I was determining the way I realized life, determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
That's it.
Remember?
Most of you?
He only stood his gold.
I'm going to talk about many of you.
Think, I don't need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone, turn it off.
You sleigh, come this step.
It's not about getting rid of you, but slow down.
The disconnected and cell phones?
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor?
Thank you.
(Laughter) And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you the external connection tool that connects to the human being.
Now, look at the environment where you are, look back, look at me, look at the ceiling to the stage.
Then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at her in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss.
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
(Making drum-like sounds) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born from fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's a real fear of what's inside, a fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Remember the roof, remember the walls, remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system of the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at this moment, a different piece of mind of you is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
(Laughter) Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the hot chicken, and soon you learned that a little before the hand touching the chicken, you felt the temperature and took our fingers to the chair, too, there is a knowledge.
Now, with the system of connected vocalization and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply the space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult, it's new, it's new, it's new, it's new, equality, there's nothing strange here.
(Laughter) It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence is to realize that much of what we do is determined by what we've already seen.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become a planet with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available are simple.
But it's the last generation technologies.
We already know that in the future of the evolution of race, communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection, in fact, happens when you communicate authenticity to another authenticity: silence is a source of freedom.
Tedxte.
Who has never gone through a TED talk that has had the first video?
(Laughter) Usually, it's the first view, as it was my case, I can say that it's an absolutely tough betrayal.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of a legion of famous TEDx, that asked for translations in a shared way, their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In Brazil, the work of translation is, in the end, only 5% of the people according to the supermarket budget are less influenced in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world, 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's translated to 16 and young people and almost 6,000 translations made at that moment.
But we're not only translated, as we've also transferred the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx to the world, but it compares to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, my case wanted to be in Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially, the TEDx with our own indigenous logo, abandoned subjects with technology of the roof, entertainment, which is the "e" that we can translate as diverse, and designs the Paulo to refer to.
And another of my ambitions.
By allowing what the subject is this auditory to the 21st century.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our greatest life expectancy, but also the resolution of the human workplace throughout history.
I think the fact that one of the uses I do in my productive recipe is to translate, review and transcribe, as a bubble, talks in an environment that can be the "strox" TEDx pieces, or the TV series, even very small children.
And I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a key word in my life.
I don't only want to help me deal with my secretary, I'm a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that Trantor is a privileged mentor, not only because a pleasure to translate these talks, be a TEDx, a TEDx, a TED event, with me and a translator.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here at this event.
Inspiring people, but why do I think my time is precious?
(Laughter) Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence in active initiatives like this one, in the hotel.
The second dangerous one is the cold.
I opened the promise of man in life.
Audience: Yes!
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) It gives light to the middle and become what is empowered, that I don't have a doubt of education.
But it's fundamental for that.
And I don't have a doubt, that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged, with good crime, the excluded to our society can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I think of a volunteer work, I think it's a work of donation, whether I donate if I have to be a volunteer, because if I choose mine, a mine decision.
And I have to do it in the best possible way and have to commit myself.
To donate the time that the shadow is different from donating the pieces of our time.
The tradition is a complex activity that remains not only to know the foreign food, but mainly our world.
And it works sources, it works like this.
On the contrary of a perfect translation, there's always a well-known knowledge that shows research, a lot of work, many vertical hours.
And behind such a fluent translation for the elderly beans, there's always a degree that I've tasted.
(Applause) And frustrated, with facts, what?
(Laughter) The best thing that makes us, he can always do better.
Because the text can be improved almost in definition.
(Laughter) And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, right, the majority.
But, despite this, we create for the quality of our translations, not only regarding the speaker, but in respect to those who invest.
And to guarantee this quality, in the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, where we have a Portuguese coordinator, or a coal coordinator, or as we call it "NC," in the case of Brazil, all translations and transcessions pass through a television made by their own volunteers.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I said, "Stories."
We have Zai Penama, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
We have our guys who are crazy, of my birth, liked the tone or the tone and the coffee.
(Audience): The world is fine.
This obsession that I have in education, in fact, has to do.
Not only with Brazil, who lives a deep, political crisis, that the education is connected to this group of bread, but without even having my own personal history.
My father, who, today, had been two years old, who was living in a primary school course, even though he knew how to write very well and make the rooms in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study beyond because he was studying and do his four children at the time for many plates, the biggest city that we sleep.
In some sides, my father had come from his beginning to his elderly logic, and his site also knew, as a commercial, he had a small material of a presence store.
(End of video) However, in 1964, where a great presence in Brazil, due to this reception and other reasons, my father was the false and lost absolutely everything, he entered, without anything, that I've been killed in the cells.
One felt as humiliated as if I paid for my father's name, and decided, after paying his debates, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold lady behind, eating well liked to go.
The first horizon.
My mother, who today is 90 years old, isn't she?
(Laughter) In addition to being an asteroid, Parado Games, still today, on the arm.
It wasn't a good cooking event, it was a warning warning warning warning warning, and it decided to make advice to sell, so for many years, in my house, where it was literally banned, from the worst pain.
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and my mother were that we, auditors, studied.
And so it was done.
A big event without a doubt, because according to the data of the nursery research in the Parliamental Parliament of the 48 years, at the 60s of Brazil, only 32% of the people with higher personality than the fundamental one.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared.
In the slightest days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting myself in foot when I was seven years old, at that time, we called the "Cabine Penns," when I asked my newspaper to go to him and to any visit that appeared at home.
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
(Laughter) Today, I've been thinking that this should be the greatest pants in the park, (Laughter) I, my five brothers, managed to study, but we got more than this today, we managed to give our children, when the Nik, the parents never put this talk to me, but for my father, they were living in a little and for my children.
Coincident that encouraged four of us, my brothers, became teachers, education is being a serend, at some point in life, and one of my brothers is the educator without well-being of their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we had to be obsessed with education, despite the limited conditions, despite developing our country, education has a priority inside our homes.
And my passion with initiative is a TEDx, just like my father, was a simple manager, inspired us, just like today, inspired by these marvelous speakers.
(Laughter) TED doesn't inspire us to spread the idea.
What they make us believe in art.
Think about everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where she can feel the things written.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create, from my notebook, in which I wrote to her, that I was learning, gave me tips, I made many times, and I also exchanged several letters from dots in my notebook, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet and made a lot of times, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, learning about robotics, programming, and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and we started to work, but we saw that there was no Internet, we decided to create our own clock, and we showed the hours and minutes in Braille, to make a smaller translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it was to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world, suddenly, we saw that something that was born from our own interests and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have a revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create, with this we are committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, and there's still a lot to be done to help people.
Thank you.
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
They can't go to the manual.
OK, we're all in agreement, two or more adults, in a free and consent way, can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is a expression I prefer to use, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance commercial dance, is that there's a motor exchange, that is, there's a part of sexual relationship with the objective to have a pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients, apartments, hotels, or even street pensions, and they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve us 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual emertion.
And even in the case of the Constitution of Dults, which is forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, we're not going to talk about sex traffic situations.
The tendency to confuse that by situation, against sexual exploration, is to confuse a small part as if it were all.
Investigations have shown that Portugal falls, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I just told you, which is the state organism that field Portugal remains information about the related with human traffic, and that I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traits, which are the last data available.
It indicates that there are, in Portugal, confirmed 118 victims of traffic, human, almost all of them for likely exploration.
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
There's only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim to justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution, but often people take all the people who are in prostitution as victims.
I'm very happy.
Stories that are waiting for someone to save them.
And this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim and consider that they make an option.
Of course, we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural constructions, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate economic inequality.
In other words, social and cultural inequality, we know there is a diversity of strangements that influence the decision-making.
(Laughter) But when we talk, when we interview, when I meet the researchers, I interview conversations, I'm with the people who do sexual work, what they say is that they're an option, a standard option after disadvantage that is profitable, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who prostitute you?
Think.
Okay, and I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any pretium, or in a woman of bad aspect and mining, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely reflected with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sex work.
There's a diversity of people.
Of practices, practices, experiences, inside positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences and life trajectories are not just women in the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone sound on the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made of the Western cities.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are in the beginning of the century tell us that the perception of the street.
What will it represent only about 20% of the total of deposited people?
And when we think about a woman?
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
They're less, they're minority, but they're not negligent, we're going to give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by Lisboa's preservation and that interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of the street, as in the countryside, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of women drive, and there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
AC: Although it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex, the idea that's at the base of this law.
It's that people who are in the Constitution are victims without exception, but they're victims of very strong oppressions, namely the non-vernamental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day, with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And that indicate that this law blocks the biggest risk of its own knowledge, puts rich people to know about sex, and that increases its sustainability, the violence, the stigma and the disease.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are victims.
(Laughter) It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea of what the client has a criminality.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until investigations have shown that relationships between workers of sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are the idea of criminalizing clients is dehumane.
They are the people who are deeficient or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who run to sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its security and its pleasure, and many of them can make it go through security professionals.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure that is assistant, sexually, is someone who receives to know how to have sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroys any argument that tries that are special predalization, so if people?
You can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence, it's normal, anti-natural, and it's equal, normal and natural, that divides sexuality sexuality into two types, if it can be done, with control over the connections of work, if this can be done, without more exploration than in the workplace.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is based on the description of social description, the stigma, it's a form of violence that is based on so many observers of sex, it's very strong in many consequences: stigmatization and social security.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" divided women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in this sense, the stigma of puta is an instrument that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that is divided, normally restricted, it's the service of the sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexuality, it's a kind of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do I think we can do any of us to make so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempted, of the oldest silencing throughout time: sex workers.
So, for everyone, organized by the 70s, but precisely because of stigma, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
But after all this.
And to finish.
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex workers.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
The medicine is very good.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Art, well cured art, cured from being a doctor, is supported by a fundamental piece, in the medical relationship.
But at the same time, I have to have such a distancing that allows me to empathize this relationship, a very delicate relationship, where I have to develop, spiritually, this is a technical rigor, a technical judgment, and so that I can add the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship with our time, in the last 10 years, I've been in the Amazon more than 25 times as a surgeon, in these trips that I've accompanied many doctors, which were also there in several elections.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white avoidance, I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me.
This attempt there, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and offer to that person that involvement to that love, what this convince me, the request of flooring, oral or smelling.
All the doctors who go with us and go from there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo what we bring to our daily practice.
The simplification that occurs there can be replicated here too, it's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon, that's all this, it's the path I could cover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you make a list of objective to the students, the first objectives are: altruism, to have good.
In these same students, when we were wrong, we got someone who had a brilliant stadium with the same research, at the end of the medical class, cure, poetic, and we delivered someone technical, who knows a lot of medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
That's it.
The relationship with the oldest relationship with the patient, a bicycle, goes back to the past, in Greece.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't made before, because it's the fish in medicine, where it's the father, the medicine, which is pop, it doesn't mean that medicine wasn't made before, when the air was dancing, and this was going to make a lost air, it's what we do until today we didn't touch the same thing.
So why is the address considered, in fact, medicine and its father teaches me why for the first time, to have a method?
It can be art, healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replied, and in a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
That even today it's used in medicine formature, in the world, it was made a 7th Cristo, a photographer.
I'm going to talk to the media, and you've prepared three words.
In all the houses that entered.
I just spoke about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of the children and of the brains.
That's why what they saw, respecting the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respect this judgment and not violating, being ethical of repute and men in all times, and if I transcribe a wave, in this case, I have a work of participating in a profession that is registered for a young man.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a very incurate individual, and it's going to lose all this knowledge, so today a patient has a medical team that produces science in a way that the next could go further, what happened to this, the knowledge, the doctor, that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group of small groups, with a teacher, and I tricked with to be like this: "Look, patients have, take the resonance, and in two pieces, when we copy the contraction, "Oh, I'll see the whole network."
Edolo.
We had to tap the patient's finger and noticed that he was smoking and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth time showed he had emagressed.
But these maps are crazy, you can see if it's taking care of your own clothes, the dark bigo can say a lot, "Oh, when you're wearing a patient, you're having a moment of intimacy, you have to remember something that doesn't give you a consultation, and if all this doesn't convince you.
Besides, as you're seeing, patient.
And you're here to answer the vulnerable area, he's telling you to extend me.
And at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good, that you're asking him, leave the care of you.
This relationship is this magic, it's not just a number of functional diseases, it's a house where we don't know why it appears, there's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no range, there's no clue, it's no clue, it's no cloud, it's no cloud.
And what happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you must raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's relationship, I'm a patient, and to be passive for those who are at least for me."
Because we'll talk about this for a group of media, because, in the end, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two areas.
My doctors, contractors, are at the time we stop, who knows we're passive, and it's because it's in our curve process, and it's not only in search of healthy, but also in developing your cure process, in the decisions of this curve process.
Let's do it.
There's a content to say, "Today, a Google, you have a very important lesson, so there are some things we have to think of different information, to convince someone to publish something that is a editor, for example, to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the result of filter, so there's a lot of good information, a lot, a lot of good information, very important, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot of things, and we need to do, a lot of information, a lot, a lot, and a lot, and we need to do.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but I know who I am, and this gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I did, and they allow me for nothing, and this is bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, or selling media or other things like this.
Now, your problems have finished, seriously, you'll see, there's something very important, it's hardly a laboratory with the scientist, it's going to have an immediate discovery, without the scientific society doesn't have a mature of this, it doesn't change, it't change, so it doesn't have something that has discovered today, tomorrow it's in the Internet, and my mother, and my mother doesn't know it't know it, it't know it't know it't know it, it, it's low, it's low, so it's not for us, so it's not for the last.
Take the information, discuss your doctor, he's there for this information in an equal knowledge, but disculp your doctor.
Second very important thing to be born in a certain process: they don't want to have the right to exist, to know, to position time, we'll have to do with that the assistance is not different, but, I don't think this is going to change in the audience, the guy doesn't have time to understand me, I work for 20 years, but I don't have the culture in the world.
Once I was in Amazonia, in her TV, she was in Venezuela, she was a mountain, and it was a friend, and we had a patient there, who had cancer.
It's like humor.
So, for us, we brought São Paulo to be treated here in the future of cancer and gay.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his transcription, I had a very good Portuguese translator, as I was very bad, he was obviously unbearable, and I presented a conflict that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the doctor, you're like this.
"Oh, that's it."
The doctor said, "Pan, I don't care.
The big thing is that at that moment the magic happened, that individual without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, that other individual had all the interests of taking care of it.
This magic, which is the art of letting go, so you don't need to tell a lot of figure, it happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking that there are doctors attending in prototypes, in ambulants, in consultants, which are anonymous.
So, we, doctors, can try to find actively in your process of cure for more unity in our treatment, curating, taking care of what is going to do, because of a connection, and the world is going to be more well treated.
Good evening.
I'd like to talk to you about a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions that changed my evolution of making decisions. The racing of the journalist who had three innovations in nature: a digital nature, 59 dollars.
The respect of this experiment is that the great majority of people chose how to digitalize the printed by also serveries and individuals.
What I like many experiments is that they usually believe in two groups for a second group, only two options were distributed.
GB: A digital option, 58 workers.
GG: And we're talking about how the residents too.
And what's interesting is that, for this group of people, most of them chose digital option.
When I talk about the experiments, I kept thinking, "What did this option change most people's lives in pain?"
And this left me very uncomfortable, she called Tikore, and I learned a lot about this in a theory that studies cognitive psychology and neuroscience applied to the decision-making question.
AC: There's an interesting formula, you can see here, but sometimes there are two options to be better, for what I'm going to pay between 25 dollars: our company, if I can have two for the same.
And this is impressive because I started to question myself why I said everything, and a talk that, including the TEDx, made the Internet all over it, was a talk that made a comparison.
These behaviors are today's illusions.
I think everyone talks about the New York Center, the Civil Azudelis appears a little bigger than the Azulto Lanto Direct, agree?
Because I have another improvement that I'm fascinated by listening, but we see that it's a different way, because I've come back from influencing, the truth is that it's the same size, it's this one.
The fairy craders of above are equal to low chess pieces.
It's at that moment that I look and say, "No, I have the problem in the manga, that's all, but I'll show you what it is."
Without the affection of the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes some sense to say that it has a return to us, the work of technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an education through safety, and we were worried about the difficult figure, it's a lot of option and we're not going to explore it.
After choosing two options, these three, or these two, and the team was working was putting a way and, in a certain way, distributing that we were working, but they said, "Who is the possibility of choosing options, if the person was from mechanics, and there were these three options."
That's when, together with the concept of the journalist of Economists, I ended up realizing that there were people.
What they do is draw the architecture of decisions, where I work with decisions.
And this led me a lot of lesson: X, but only three people in the world of technology have even the name of this profession, called YOEX, and the Researchers or the experience of the eyes, and are the architects of decisions, working in the decision-making architects, all formed and environments in all these areas.
That's why I stopped with my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, he's the person who has to bring the knowledge of the behavior economy to the digital world, and he's super fascinated that he's going to talk to you and produces a lot of review, and he's going to talk to the behavior.
If any of the people who have a smartphone get a crazy thing for 22 hours, nearly, but they get a research in the company that says, "Go to BPI, I think we need a lot of research to know that we will use a lot of cell phone.
So, from these 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think are these digital donors, these universities will be if we were using digital food or that the habitability sometimes is not in one of us.
Is it that when I go to this horizon and eat a person, I'll start to ask myself about this, how many decisions we're delivering and giving the power to the city we take for us, and we put the "weis" in terms of this lesson like this, that is Google?
It's necessary to identify it.
Talents of the Enlightenment should talk to you about another first interesting: it's a wall in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata, it's 4% - I'm here to ask you to think it was this and say, "Oh, the number is activated."
(Laughter) It's not strange, in this case, it's a number of two pieces of work.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, because in Austria you're already a teenager, you need to ask to leave?"
In Dinamarca, you don't need to ask to enter, without doing anything, it's the decisions I call "decision of birth," you need to ask to leave.
(Laughter) Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and then I had two options: one to receive the recipes and another to receive offer.
(Laughter) Ressigo was dismartened to the offspring and was dead, so someone decided I wanted to go to Africa, I didn't want to receive, so I went there and I went to leave.
(Laughter) I asked to get out of the audience's mark and recycle markets.
The Uber has a new functionality, a pupa, you can share the car with other people, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, you don't know if you take the work that they love to know, but when the guy arrived at the top, and he looked strange and said, "There's another way, there's another person, that a lady chooses the cube."
(Laughter) So, fascinatingly, choosing the business without even knowing it, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are, if we were Google today, there are 567,000 results.
What is it that we click?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in the Google.
But did we choose a place where people eat, was I, wasn't Google?
After that, what I do, I'll read a click on the website.
(Laughter) I love the website, I see from there what parents don't, "I'll go to the right page," it's to ask for it.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
AC: These English taxes have a name in the behavior economy also have name, they are called "dinities."
The concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, and the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "There's a book called Dante, I thought it's a cell phone, there's a cell phone, there's a cell phone, there's a simple way for us to understand these bodies in the digital world, I wanted to ask you to give a little pharmacy in the person to do it, not to do it."
(Laughter)
(Laughter) But it's not true, and in this talk I've created a picture, it's important to see ... (Laughter)
Audience: No.
AC: You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austria and Detina Maca.
AC: Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
(Laughter) In this email that a text written, "Aus inscribes, TEDx de uma pessoa, you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life," (Laughter) "Awispica, I'm going to do it."
(Laughter) If you don't want to give up, it's enough to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
In other words, one of the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave, (Laughter) So this means that I keep building all the decisions of life from 300 to 70 conversations. (Laughter) No, this is an experiment and I show the results.
Genome is people who ask you a fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
AC: In these dates, can this make us manipulate someone?
And my answer is that, yes, danger is that knowledge is a tool.
As, for example, if you're there, you can use to do what someone buys something she doesn't need, or you can say to the good, to make a patient of diabetes come out at the time, it serves even more harmful.
Or you can say, to avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same athlete, which makes the medition of the brain waves to detect a kitchen to edit a accident.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we made one of these decisions in the digital world, what you can imagine was: Pokémon Go.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual learning, and what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better how these puppets work, how these signs work, we'll be able to build a better world, and we'll be able to be more aware for us to make better decisions, thank you.
