I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed by the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil, we're seeing a paradox: our children are the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children come very badly treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection, and it requires us to provide changes, which is what I hope to do a little with you today: if we think about the children of Brazil, which is the majority of the criteria of Mandela, we are a terrible character, because we deny them, and if they reveal.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, and, of course, she can be humanized, and she can be born, and she then begins to go to Navidad, one of the many pediatric children who can take a lot of love at home, and replace a very expensive car, and replaced by a very expensive car of her, for those who are very few children who are in the city, who are not here.
Briela grows, his mother's problem is directly overwhelming, and in this way, we're losing the privileges of the amidation, and trying, through the first pregnancy, the natural birth of the material, serious health problems in the children, and that will even reflect on the adult's life, which is discovering now, and it grows because the grandma can't take care of it.
The invitation is what gives us the intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being careful about it, and the child loses with the most important people in their lives, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their childhood.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, there's no way to connect with the Brazilian wall, who's going to pass on the way of meditation, and, since four months, since they've been chosen, they need to run the food of a healthy food, they're completely addicted, they're not even at the same time, they're missing, they're not even at the same time, they're missing, they're missing, they're missing, they're missing, they're very distracting, they're missing, they're going to the same time, they're going to be able to go, they're in the same time, they're in the same time, they're going to be able to be able to play, they're going to play, they're going to play, they're in a little, they're going to play, they're a little, they're in the same time, they're going to go, they're in a little, they're a little, they're in the way,
(Laughter) It's this name, IPOR, I opened it to four hours of television per day, it's massacred by advertising, it's more educated by advertising than by teachers, because we have less time for us, creativity and imagination, and we're pushing this from our children.
And then, in the weekend, of course, it goes to the park, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program of the Brazilian family at the weekend, which is me, very well, but it will be more massacred by advertising, and, obviously, that they are profoundly affected by smelling products, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, for smells, and for smells, and for smells, and for smells, for smells, and for smells, and for smells, for smells, and for me.
