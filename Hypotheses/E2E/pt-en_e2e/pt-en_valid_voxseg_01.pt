I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed by the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil, we're seeing a paradox: our children are what we have the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children are being very bad treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection and demands that we can change, which is what I hope to do a little with you today.
According to Mandela's criteria, we are a terrible character, because we deny the basic rights as health, housing, food, and if they rebel it, we offer it to prison.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, and we're going to take the wave of Gabriela, a very convincing class, so convincing, that produces the culture of the Cesare, a culture that can be hungry, and, in two months of seven pieces that we're going to be able to be there, in the city, and it's a doctor, and it's a very recess, and it's very powerful, and it's very powerful, and it's not very powerful, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, in two months, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, it's very expensive, it's very expensive, and it's very expensive, and it's in two months in two months,
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms: "Premean," "experpray."
The maternal milk, Tadinho, is Pro, it's loving, but the industries do directly with the doctor, doing the markets, convincing the newspapers and dinner, and congresses, and patrocinating integrally the doctor's society, which ends up unconsciously, with a lot of love, and it reflects on the adult life, which is discovering now, because the grandma can't take care of it.
The invitation is what gives us the intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being careful about it, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their lives, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their childhood.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, they don't have money to pay employees, and they end up exchanging, we're exchanging the Brazilian food food food food food food food food food, which is wonderful, so that children are completely addicted to food and healthy food, they can't, because they are annoying.
And this leads serious problems, like diabetic obesity, that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to give food, that we can come from healthy food, for our children, it's not so healthy because it's in one of the agrotoxes, and we're also worldwide consumption of agrotóxes.
Audience: Yes.
Gabriela will go to a church that has cables, since four months, and two stages for each one, if it's not the same in the car, we'd look at the window, we'd go to the landscape, in the form of meditation, and then, when I'd travel with cars, it's an incredible moment of living, it's highly distracting, it's a moment of being destroyed, it's not even at 10 hours, it's a moment of being destroyed.
(Laughter) Even in moments, where the child needs more money, this exists, this comes from the weapons, you can go there, punish the hypothesis.
This is the name - IPOR - I opened it, there are four hours of television per day, it's massacred by advertising, it's more educated by advertising than by teachers, because we have less time for us, creativity and imagination, and we're pushing this from our children.
And then, in the weekends, of course, it goes to the park, it doesn't go to the park, the family does the classic program of the Brazilian family in the week, which is U, very well, where it will be more massacred by advertising, by consumption products, and this advertisement is an obsessive program.
The hyper-valorization of appearance.
Audience: Yes.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, even in the consumption of alcohol consumption, we know that the bee in Brazil is not bipidocolic, it's totally liberated, and the market of the mercantilization of childhood and consumption is very successful, because their parents want to be full of commitment, and their agents are more than their agents.
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who's already in the middle of the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." (Laughter) There's no beautiful meditation, which is this one.
Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this: the type of erotization that our society proposes, in desertion, that uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization, which is based on machismo, the objectification of women and sexuality.
This is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their heads completely when they've been eight or ten years old, the affection of the childhood and the erotization for what?
We know that the importance of limits are not fundamental forms of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability, instead of that, we're doing what the Americans call "Helicopterprinting," we're interconnected between the experiences of their children and the world, and when they need a child, and they don't develop mechanisms to lead with their frustration, they don't have a lot of love, and they need a lot of love, and they need to give them, and they't have a lot of them.
What's the solution that we won't give to bad children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, no, the medication, we need to do something about it, it's not possible to these children in this way, in the same way, of course, the childhood will be rebeld, whilsty, etc.
Kin, from Mafalda, says this: "Take a wonderful way, they buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact, what the fact is that people spend bad in these children, not only with the elastic children, adults, also in an overwhelming way.
The medicalization of the most directed phenomena of the attention and interactivity had today, in school, it would be exactly this: rotating, normalizing, and asking that children to be themselves, and I'm sure that some of these genius, in the world, are not working, we need solutions, but better, change the paths, we're always a very complex solution, and invariably, and invariably, obviously, obvious, obvious.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we think about this, a very useful solution to TEDx, I'm also going through my time, but it's OK, I'm a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what can we do? When we talk about pecados, we're talking about penitence, penitence, today, means "dismo," in almost all the churchs, what do we have of more precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 hours of vigilance, one.7 hours we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes, this gives a lot and 40 per day, it's not very possible, it's only to priorize, and if it doesn't give us the time to convive our children, in relation to space, I'd like to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, my own self-confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a bad place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not a good place to live.
Let's see this place.
How would he be?
Look at your eyes.
And they tell me if you fit in this statement.
Yes, right?
I'm sure most of you, yes.
This shows us the importance of nature among us: nature is profoundly associated with health, remains, it's these factors, we all know this, what we don't know, and there was an interesting experience, I started that with the pattern behind, who wasn't bringing me in my presentation, and said, "Wow, but you're talking about something incredible, I didn't know that everything I do good for me, it't be good for nature, with open space, what he does."
And when I talk about elevating cancer problems, we're not talking about spaces when mines with the public space with nature, that promote psychorias, events for free knowledge, for children, who will know each other, and learn to deal with them, they'll promote the book between families, with love, with affection, and mental intelligence, and they'll reduc the consumption of physical materials.
Places accessible and well careful, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, it's the word occupied, practically used for citizen resistance, and, above all, it means this, occupying public space with joy, and, mainly, taking part in the governance of the city.
So, in summary, this is our proposal: children, already outside, go to the city, we're going to occupy the public spaces with a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, and lives very early, we're going to take the kids to the square for the water, for the invitation, and we're going to learn to take care of the other, and we're going to reduce inequality.
The more I approached myself, the more he gets away, if it approached me a thousand steps, it's already a thousand steps, so that it serves utopia exactly to make us walk, that it makes us walk outside.
Thank you.
In 2007, I came across a great group of young adults with disabilities, including regular education, and since then, my greatest challenge was to look and see people's efficiency marked by their disabilities.
So I created the Cafétherapeutic project, the group of parents, students and friends, searching for a really inclusive society.
To be able to discuss the inclusion inside the school, with parents, with their children, and with their partner, people with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents, to the community and to the general society.
People with disabilities, sometimes they're left aside, stop having friends.
However, they think they're not able to have friendship.
So, throughout four years, he stayed in the court participating in all the physical education classes and with the teachers, for four years, he didn't enter the classroom to feel act with people, with the case of the Igor in Igor, for example, and people didn't make a strength for that, he was running all the time.
When I got to Campulimpo, I sought to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school, and what together we could do for him to be.
They were better learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a despair place.
Well, it's not that a clean guy, today he's very happy, he has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
He said I'm his best friend and, for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on his parents' Day.
I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading, the school can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning.
Schools think that they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them, but schools need to win these difficulties, they need to use and believe that they are capable and that these kids inside the school.
To do good for them, it's going to do good for other students, for school community, and for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others, because the choice is like this.
I have what I know, I have what you know, and I have what we can learn together.
AC: Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see.
I learned the disabled.
My hearing, living with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs with those who can't walk.
(Laughter) And I learned to value my ideas, with those that often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart and the heart of my students, to create connections and friendship lakes.
And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise.
From empathy, thank you very much.
Good evening.
Audience: Yes.
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been to cook: when I was a child, I loved to see my grandmother cooking.
To cook, to work in the kitchen, she who took account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa, she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hand in their hands, in fact, were my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen, and this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then, something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I started to realize that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study philosophies, they registered in me, something that is the Cuidated and respect for nature.
So I decided we could change the way we could.
Thank you very much.
I build the food system through food, and I believe...
One of the colateral effects of modernization is the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's us.
Trucé is a bit of rural life for the city, we can strengthen the laws between men and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way we can reconnect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen, but also to improve how a tool for a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
It's able to reestructure the food system, change the food dynamic, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example, there are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale.
Today, Brazil is the greatest consumer of agrotoxic products in the animal, it's accelerated artificially, and it begins to grow and produce in an industrial scale for our health, and for the environment, because, as it can cost so little, you can create an animal, and its quality of life, and its health consumption in average, 5 kg of agrotóxics per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so, they keep tolerating this abuse in the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer is why our current society.
So, I'd like to understand and discover that this change of values, and we need to teach people to appreciate the organic products, because when you buy a false profile, because you think there's someone who cares with all the love and affects it, there's no investment in your health, and we respect nature.
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food, in terms of distribution, it's not efficient, for the culinary and nutrition.
It's simply desperate, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why those executives or those scared people walking on the street, talking about a very harmful piece of pizza, for example, because, in fact, it's very important, and in terms of consumption, many people think that we lose the notion of society, and, in fact, it's a very harmful way of distribution for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these little whiskers and so on, also have many chemical addictions, they degenerate our nervous system, a food dependency, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes jokes, instead of buying that small pack of panels, that pack of panels in the microwaves, look, half a half, (Laughter) who still makes jokes, also half a half a half, huh?
(Laughter) This question may seem a bit harmful, I don't want to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only to exchange the popcorn of microwaves, a package in this that could be a less likely waste in the world.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think it's very dynamic to feed this food system, it's not healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
To cook.
It's this name of art, culture, pleasure, wisdom.
To cook brings independence, bring autonomy, self-knowledge, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
If we don't cook, someone will cook for us.
I hope it's not an industry, (Laughter) because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes, so if you leave the industry feed you.
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What about a pizza?
I think there are many people who don't have the price for the kitchen, who don't have the price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very far away, but, for example, if you let the red beaten in front of us.
This would be maybe at the same time that you would take to wait the pizza to get there.
So, I believe we must change the book of pizza.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: man, woman.
So, changing education, we teach children to take the children to the fair to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, child, adult, gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook, so the children will grow.
I believe that we have to change the food dynamic, we have to value the food more, value the act, growing food, a healthy food; they will grow independent of the pharmaceutic industry, to eat.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to leave, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us to have less hospitals, this is education, education and prevention.
The future of food will decide the future of humanity.
cooking.
And choosing good food is choices we can do to change the world for better, thank you.
Life is not the one we live in.
But it's the one we remember and remind us of telling.
Being here in the background, to talk about the power of my mother's transformation, is being here, I came here, when I was a child, spending vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to the families' parties.
(Video) My grandmother, Mario Güeyuce, was the first tribe planter of the mechanized work in Brazil, here in the earths of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got to my grandmother's grandmother, and after having my five siblings, I got to this world, casually, it was yesterday, before looking at this future, we wanted to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history, and honor all stories.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories and announces in 15, 30 seconds about products, this book helped me live the mourning, so having used this story, that I needed to expand, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in the history of others, they always feel very important to me.
So, I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx, about everything they had done with him, and I left him because he had to do with him, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bullying, because that he always suffered, without fear.
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, of the people I know they know, also of having seen that the wheelchair they imagined, that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defense, and they started to understand him better, and he welcomed us.
He welcomes me in his story, the week went by, he sent me a audio saying that many boys have sought him, even more in the air.
So, telling stories for me are many not only in them, but if there's no rule, there's the time we can give tips about how to start, about how to tell stories, I work with this for seven years, and for me, if theater is not the biggest rule, and for me, if we don't have this formula, there't have a great rule.
It has to come from the heart, and to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage, and it's not the roof that courage has a heart color over it.
I told the story of Ave, the avenue, the teacher of the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening, and we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDx Laçador.
And he changed everything, and one day, two weeks before the talk of him, I called him in the Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this, every time you talk about it, about the importance of listening to the other, and how was the fact that he had heard when he needed the person, when he had cancer.
So we talk about change, but we're afraid to change, we're going to change, and we've seen this today, that when we hear the truth, there are so many courses of office and writing, there's always this fear, and as we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, and how to listen.
I'm not going to listen to ourselves and to others.
And listening, we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time for people, because we're worried about our lives, we always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about my empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
And this, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, and I could tell you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most varied stories I heard, all the others.
For example, when we say in the street, many of us, that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, we have, we have at least a smile, and it doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell, that they make us be who we are, and to listen to each other in fact, we change ourselves, and, in the middle of the preparation, a fight that was a process here for me, it was out of my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot of people asked me, "But Ana, why are you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?"
Liberating fear means that many people I know had, at least one minute of rest, after they could look at the side and go back to their lives, from the fourth of the flaws, of the values, of the kitchen, of the uncertainty, I wanted to free many people I know, to have the right to change the right of not to love, and to come back to smil, to tell and hear.
And you, what stories are you going to tell about your life, what stories do you want to tell about you?
Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, or there are no judgments, where there are all kinds of stars, only belong to their plural spaces, there's no flag, ugly, rich or poor.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender who was attributed to her at the moment she was born, but, in fact, resisting and always was my life condition for me, and the right for life.
So, why does this create this poem, because it does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars already in the sky, no one was covered or the beauty of the other, the universe is infinite, and, together, there are millions and millions of stars, but we couldn't produce something so simple: accept empathy.
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society in which we were all equal, so, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand the other, it's important that we understand who we are first, where I laugh, where I cried, where I questioned the bathroom, the bathroom, and the opportunity to be different.
Well, the bathroom turned into a better friend, he was always there, after a bullying replete, or when I wanted to put his place in his head and dance rebeldes, because I only repeated until today.
(Audience) Yes.
But the question is: what was in the bathroom that there were no other places and that was denied to me, and, for this difficult path, it was in theater that I learned to deal with the difference, theater showed me a lot of information, and, if you still have to learn to deal with the acceptance of the other, it's as if you enter a couple, it's a time there, it's a beautiful bone, it's a little bit of turning.
They bother each other with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come, do you bring new things, don't you have traffic face, no, you're easy, it's going to pass?"
Folks, who are consciousness and choices that life expectancy is 35 years old?
Is there any crazy person here who wants to see your institution?
While men have their life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, chooses to live in the country that kills trans people all over the world?
And I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the National Association of transvestite Women said that we, transsexual women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed.
I started to use my art as a form of disconnection of life for many people, and, for example, if we compare with the United States, for example, the number of Brazilians have to have 9 times more chances of dying with the rest of criodity and becoming a model, the cap of reviewing and driving, for other people, not only an option, I couldn't be able to drink the best panels, but in each one of us, and I could be able to change the world, for more than a million people, in 130 countries.
ME: It's a responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went out of my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that appeared on me on the Internet, they talked about it, they were comments like macho, shown, showing, "You'll never be a woman, die, what doesn't have a price."
What doesn't have a price is to receive messages of other trans girls, degrading me, to teach them more than their own daughter.
The best message of other trans girls, with brilliant eyes, thank me for seeing me there and seeing me, this has no price.
So, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm far beyond that, I'm far beyond it, but to understand this, I have an unknown place, I really need to understand that we're many, we're very pleasant, someone who can definitely change the world.
The sky is the refugee of being isolated, but the future, not more looks, I and the sky that marks my soul, is what I want: a side, now I'm, I'll fly, I'll fly, very brilliant.
(Applause) I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've been working with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
And I spent many years doing this, and accompanying children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, open the belly, take the tumors, and it's not going to take a course, I was already used to the doctors, the nurses, and I decided to go to the surgery there."
I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point, nothing, and I went to the two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and I didn't have it, and I asked my parents to call my parents, and she said, "It's outside the visiting area, and it's just about tales."
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So, I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites, and the only thing that was the safe information at that moment is that I would die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information that sometimes it didn't help, that didn't engage, and how can you engage someone, otherwise you can't even say the word "cancer."
I was a doll, and I opened what bothered me, scholarshiped, laughed, but my friends were hurting my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized this information of society to help me in my hair, in fact, the surgery wasn't for me, the surgery was for them, that I couldn't see myself expensive, and with that I thought it wasn't the most adequate.
When I entered the hospital, Careca, I got from you, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer, the children said, "Wow, you'll be a hair to stay like us," I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I don't get it."
But the games were overwhelmed, and the children started to talk about things and count on the procedures, which in this kit came a sabonete, a cow of teeth, but also a shampoo and a pent, and I didn't fit it.
So, for me, they showed me, sent videos, working, kimiotherapy, going through the radio, several procedures, until the doctors started to explain to me, "If there's a patient who's going to put me here, and I said, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I don't have a lot of money, but I't have a lot of money, and we can't understand that the doctors't understand that the doctors were going to talk about it, because they's a lot of health professionals, and what they're going to work, and what they're going to do, and what they're going to do, and what they're going to do, because they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're a lot of course, they're going to do, they're going to do, they're going to be a lot of course
I think it's good, so we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes: these terms came out of our first material, which was a guide, and it's still distributed to 3,000 guides per year, if we had a patrocinator in the audience.
When I was in treatment, if there's something in society, unfortunately, I'm a publisher, and we know if you know more about it, sometimes the child is overwhelmed, it's with cancer, in a kit, and sometimes it's not only for children, because children, and parents, many times, they're in the alphabet, it's more than 40s in Brazil.
(Laughter) And what happens with this, and when you're the patient, how many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "My daughter is giving me a lot of problem at home, I want to go to the hospital to see what a difficulty is."
OK, the mother wants to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window, to see, and a good life is good, and at that time we need self-esteem, you only have information that put you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
We make information with all this state, to help some children, they save my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, it's not easy because it's the dependence here in the disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
(Laughter) But what if, in fact, if the answer is inside us to treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right?
It's in search of this that we thought about many things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of these defense defenses, which can be protected by big threats, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and don't do bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they are very small molecules, and for being very small, they have a almost balanced passage for the ematoencephalic barrier, and that's why they end up entering and acting in our brain in the circus of recompense in another circuit.
We also have another system of protection, which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, until it can engage it and neutralize it.
Well, then, could we not join these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are innate, which are ours?
A few years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day when some researchers used drugs against their own drugs, it's almost as if their immune system disseminates them like this.
It's enough, you don't need drugs in the system, you're overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use this immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
(Laughter) Yes, my team.
And then, that problem that Barria Metcefalca had to let the drug pass on, that is, the immune system produces anticorps and anti-corps are large molecules, and in the last two years we can get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is capable of sending this message to our immune system.
And look at this image here, how is this beautiful process, OK?
Here, the right to you, we have a rhythm that didn't receive the vaccine, and then you can see, on the left side of you, there's a pretty significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, when these rats don't receive this cocaine that was passing.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rats have a concentration of radiation much greater radiation than the rats that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking, drugs were arrested in blood fabric.
The other very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these people who have chemical dependency, so our group is working now, it's, in fact, to bring this solution to the market, to help people earn freedom, we believe that they have a more inhibit than they don't happen with the rats who receive cocaine.
Narrator: Goal!
Invisible, the air in the wind.
Wow!
"I'm being."
A psychotherapist.
It's more than 40 years.
I want to say, besides.
It's painful.
Isn't it nice?
It's psychological.
There's a trendy disease.
Finally, everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
That Janifelenu, Pierre, go, and me.
We're called "normal."
Patrology of normality.
And I must say that maybe these beaves of encantation.
The big encounter of this TEDx.
KA: Thank you.
That's it.
No, the song is sitting.
Thank you.
Ponctuate from the beginning.
What is the nurse?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors full of social processes.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some sense.
In some meditation.
The war is, for example, maybe the most dead example of what the north is.
Until where I can understand, there are two fundamental foundations of the norm, and it's the systemic situation.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
From respect to the fact that the norm has always existed.
It's not always existing, it's a typical disease of moments.
What do we live in a context?
Where predominates?
Violence?
Dishumanity, lack of listening, lack of care, lack of responsibility, where predominates corruption in its word "ego-centrism."
So, is it normal?
This is to adapt to a sick and maintain system.
I've been.
Is it a worker?
About 30 years ago.
From the International University of Paz.
The only step.
And people think that peace is in the good one.
What happens is the absence of conflicts, no.
"Dad, it's good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this Guinness: "How many wars, Perei, who came from a little bit of words."
Archimilitary for peace.
But with other areas, the weapons of the responsibility.
Is love compatible?
So ...
It's the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes the duty person is the one who has the ability to present symptoms.
symptoms, concepts.
Sometimes it's even...
A conscious, lucid, indignation?
Juste.
This makes me remember.
From a family word, "When my daughter is Isabela, she's five years old, and today she's 34.
And there's a 8-8 boy.
The mother asked, "What's the princess you like the most?"
Is the cigarette, Cinderella, the beautiful adolescence?
She thought and answered.
And I like all the Mayan writes.
I also, "I too."
I respect many people who say more.
Sometimes, because it has to be the same idea of feeling in its own skin.
I love contradictions.
All of them were sensitive people who captured the disease of panic, for example, that the "normatic" didn't feel, for not to say sensitive, had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is it the fear of a family system?
Is it a method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction?
Is it the fear of animals?
I feel disimated.
Of forests.
Being desertified, and these people say,
I respect a lot.
People denominated by psychotics and neurotics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten him.
That's why, in Africa, people who are considered crazy are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a paradise that captures cultural contradictions.
Systemic, and sometimes not fragile.
And how did I say it?
What's the language?
The difference between them.
A santo in a mad person?
It's that Santo knows, maybe, these people, at least in a big measure, that we call "psychotics" to hunt.
And I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consciousness, a dream.
The problem is in the weapons, it's the people who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I think of a occasion that I'm here from Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, when I knew I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing, he's good.
It's target of bullying.
People get rid of my son, what do I do with my son, he's good?
Do you understand what I want to say?
It became a lunch.
So ...
I have to say that all the people I have.
Respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team organized this encounter.
That nothing against the correctness.
[A.DE.]
At that moment, "Oh!
What is suffering from a desert?
So ...
You talked about the norms, the machismo, the racism, the homophobia.
From different ones.
Exclusions.
"Noramose."
We could say, "No, it's environmental.
The nurse of ultra-specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing. (Laughter)
And each one is looking at the Mino Memory, and doesn't realize, their existence doesn't make sense, we're in an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
To do the police of the generalist, but they are not the functions of the computers.
Maybe there's a concept.
In this education that has also been pointing here.
A possibility of solution that I have called vocation, as I feel the most profound voice.
From the desire that brought us to the Internet.
It's what brings us in a common stage.
It's what we're making a promise that we're saying.
We don't see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
And only you can tell yourself if you didn't count, she would lose.
"So?
The nurse's foundation?
It's the situation.
There's another very important: it's evolution, it's also been spoken today.
It's the question we need to do: What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us?
That's it.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I ask a friend, "Wow, give a space."
A alternative Nobel Prize and the economy of developing country, Max, Chilean.
When I met my dulce, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know that the human being disturbed himself, "No, language is not culture, it's humor, no."
And one day, talking to his father, that very respected world, his father says, "It won't be stupid, my end."
He assisted a little light and said he became the first stupidist.
The stupidology is a science that we need to study, it differentiates itself, for example, of imbecility, who is absolutely...
One day, I like to remember the slower, the creator of violence, a big brother, and he used to tell us that it's necessary to be a hypotalamic idiot, to be a good animal, on earths for the fourth brain.
The question is stupid, because it revers itself of rationality, a person can be highly stupid, and it's highly rational.
To have diplomas and qualified universities.
And to do as a person who is talking about sophisticated development, with graphs, tablets, like a person sitting in the garbage of a tree, closing.
"So."
Next, he also said.
That for him, there were only two infinite things.
The universe in human stupidity.
And he grew up: "Ahimist, with relation to the universe, I still have my doubts."
But I need to say that I discourse from Einstein and Max nephin, although they're pointing out, not for the characteristic of the species, yes, from the north museum to the human being.
We were born to be, to cry, not from your nature, stupidity, but on the contrary, to serve, so ...
I prefer to think of a confusion.
That what differentiates our species of other species is inaccabation, it's in complete that, in 2600 years, we don't born humans, we do ourselves humans.
But treating a kid is born, being tired, you've seen it, and go to the sea, "We don't."
We are born unreachable for this to say confuse, the human being needs education.
Have you ever heard of school for Tartarugas or for Tana Juras?
It's education, it's perfectly the perfection, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, it's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul, the psychiatrist, developing emotional intelligence, the union of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concensional?
To develop consciousness of where to play the values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
[A.DE.]
He summarized like this.
Your long exist.
At the age of 15, I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
It's 40.
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
At 50s, I knew which were the fears of the sky.
When I was obsessed, I listened to my elderly.
At the 70s, I could follow the indications of my own heart, because what I wanted no longer that day, the borders of justice, the same as the scenarios of Alexandria.
Two thousand years ago, you exchange clothes in five minutes, take a whole existence to exchange coordination.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The nurse refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
These are people who haven't invested in the most own human mind, that's why I like to trust, that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, the opposite case, the question: Is there 21st century for the human being?
And not less than that, it finds this game.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible, because it's not insidious in the dimensions, people don't realize it.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being, where his own nature can learn to know each other, to know, to smile, to smell.
Has anyone asked for the IT?
Think about God.
And UT.
"Flured."
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a monastery in the big wine.
It's flowing.
What about human beings?
What potentially?
I'm.
So ...
"I want ...
Still talking about a story we listen to doesn't happen.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned the knowledge of this story.
It was once ... "Wow!
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let it flow."
That took a source, a water drop, and played in the middle of the fire, and returned with patience, and, unfortunately, another drop was over.
The little arms already burned.
You think that with these ridiculous, Benjaflor, played in the middle, and said, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Good, are you going to erase this infernal fire?"
And I said, "I know it's not.
Now, I'm doing my friend Tatu, my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary, people who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way, because there are hundreds of people who are transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
[A.DE.]
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order, a little of love.
In this little pedacy of the world that the big world confies each one of us, and if we don't do this, where could we be transforming facilitators?
That's why revolutions.
He failed and continued failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
It means to breathe consciously with each other, with each other, I recommend a book to the Korean conspiration of Marilyn Fex.
These spontaneous, institutional movements, from a giant narrative.
Flow bee doesn't have any ideology, it doesn't have flags, it's not cutting anyone, it's pushing anyone, it's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stay standing, and we can do our part, by the way.
Since tomorrow, I'm seeing beija-flores who see each one talking about their water.
And all of you who are in this room.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you're in this stage, but in the stage of your life story, telling your story.
Raise your hand.
Your drop of water, because we can always attend a candle, instead of just complaining the darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
It's time for renewation.
I love it.
That's it.
I grew up.
GG: Let's read.
Love with the passive and poetry will still save the world.
I want to conclude with the poem of Black Sicilia.
Renova.
It's born enthusiasm.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multiply has arms to scenarios everything.
Stories, eyes that have seen you, create others for other visions.
Destrons, arms, who had this meat.
so that they forget to run.
Being always the same.
Always the other.
But always: self.
I'm always far.
And inside of you.
Thank you very much.
Between a good school.
The decoration.
I took good grades.
choose the profession that will define you for the rest of your life, while you're still a child.
I always wanted to be a lawyer, a publicitarian, a market, since my mother has angry.
I chose a recovery of public preference.
Four or five years ago, using the law of the least effort.
Remember a channel.
Imagine a multinational company that hasn't recognized me by their family, that is, "treaming."
I work twelve hours a day, exhausted until the limit of your strength.
To be obvious, your tired needs to be cruel.
Interminable interminable reunions, videocose that wouldn't take anywhere, shows that you're important for structure, more than working, it's important to appear and it's always producing.
He sees the shirt.
The car is a six flexible point.
There's someone in love, inherited, wedding.
He, mini opponents, stays the corporate pyramid, sees the shirt, lambots, job exchange.
Being a manager, the car of the firm.
(English) "I want diapers and happy."
Happiness at the time marked?
Three bad cuts and shoes.
Vista, shirt.
Luke and the first apartment have a son, after two years, your second child, is to listen to yourself.
(Laughter) Try the car, yes, year, no.
It buys an apartment and suffers 180 payments.
That first case is extra-conjugal with an interesting person in marketing.
(Laughter) Disney, two years later, seven days by Europe, Miami, Europe, Miami, people who don't take anywhere, projects that start and dismorate as their desires.
A continuous feeling of change, the void that countries in the mall in the weekends can't apply anymore.
The discharge is a pleasure antenna that if it goes so soon the lake of the merchandise is broken, seen the shirt.
The baby socially drinks every day.
The first apartment I was in the beach, the elite, the antidepressants, the void.
The middle crisis, the encounter with college colleagues, my God, as the years went fast, life is short.
My children in school, my gods, as they grew fast, are life and listening.
To be well cut by alphabets of the center, you're a principal, you're anonymous society.
The first place: after weekend in the beach, after weekend in the mountain, we'll sell the apartment of the beach, children grew up and don't even want to go to the shirt anymore.
The external thing is a little high, its classic body, as an astronaut here spent years, producing zero gravity.
(Laughter) None car, on account of the healthy habit of passing the file inside, put all the infections.
Blue has faith, fried lactose, sugar, planting semester of the academic that you used for two months, today is fourth, day of ugly, hamburgers of fingers after being tired in the film, they made a project because life is too short to eat the faces.
The vice-president, who, despite all the efforts, has never arrived, probably will never get there.
The fear of everything: the complete disconnection with your children is decorating from the 12 hours of work, from the new generations, of the change, of the new, a continuous fear that prevents you from living, fear of death.
The empty retirement surrounded by useless and little affection.
You're a winner, this is your only console, your life is executive, executed.
Vista Chamisa, from Madeira, from the true time.
Thank you.
