I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed.
For the way I treat your children.
But in Brazil, we are living in paradoxes, our children are what we have the most precious.
We want the well-being to any cost, to give them our lives, and, however, our children will be very bad treated for society.
In fact, this demands a reflection and demands that we can change, and I hope to make a little with you today.
If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, what about most of them?
According to Mandela's criteria, we are a terrible character, because we deny basic rights such as health, housing, food, we treat them with violence.
And if they rebel, we offer her the prison.
But even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and children of you who are here.
The thing doesn't work well, we commit, maybe we don't crimes.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, of affection with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, and she begins to go to Christmas, and, quickly, the red industry, but it's very convincing, so convincing that women believe that the normal birth is for her pregnancy.
Among 15 to 20% of the developed countries, this generates enormous benefits for children, this makes us lose this moment of love, and replaces for a medical, surgeon, a woman, adopted, immobilized, and, of course it can be humanized, and it can be well done, but certainly won't have the same benefits in a normal part.
Remember that, of course, there are cesáreas in these areas for each of these markets we're going to be.
And we are criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me, the same way happens with a mother's milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter.
But, as you get out of maternity, one of the many pediatrists who can be there working will say to her age, "You can take a mammal, it's an indigenous formula in your case, it's hungry, it's hungry, it's alive, it's hungry."
The child is crying, the toilet is weak in two months, this child is breastfeeding, and she loses marvels that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement for consumers, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to shapes: "Premean, ex-per-proof."
Surprising, Materno Tadinho's milk is an amator, but he just comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms.
But the industries do the advertisement directly with doctors, their markets, convinced of their medical qualities and congresses, and they are integrally taking care of the pediatric society, which ends unconsciously, being one of the biggest cases of the basics.
The privileges of the amydation, and they try, through the first pecado, which is the privation of the natural birth of the maternal leiting, serious health problems in children, in mothers, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovering now.
And my mother grows, her mother will end up in essence, she'll have to go to the church, because her grandma can't take care of it.
And she'll spend six, eight, ten, twelve hours in a institution, but get home, her parents are regretted from tired from a long workplace, in bottles, and they'll live little with her daughter, and they'll take a shower because, after all, no one is iron.
And what happens is that we lose what is more precious in childhood, we, as much as it depends on adolescence, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their lives.
The coexistence is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person, these are our precious children and we are losing this because of the terrible peculization of the child.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, they don't have money to pay employees, and they end up exchanging, we ended up exchanging the Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy, for a rich food, fatigue, saturated, huge salt and sugar arms.
Crocants out there, swallows inside, all the weapons that industries, through food engineering, highly developed, do so that children can be completely addicted to healthy food, they can't, because they are annoying.
This leads serious problems, like diabetic obesity that are exploded in childhood, and even if we want to give food, that we get from healthy food, for our children, it's not so healthy because it's in one of the agrotóxes data, and we're the world's consumption champions.
This is the sintoxication of childhood that also leads serious problems.
Gabriela will go to a church that has cables, for four months, and someone knows that it's highly negative to the involvement of a child.
She has an absolutely explosive energy, she needs to run to play, go out, and, however, in our urban life, it doesn't allow them to leave children to leave, she stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise she can, she doesn't block me, and doesn't want this entire world.
So these children spend eight statistical people.
Eight to ten connected hours with your devices today, again, connected with the yellow device, it's great, but not eight hours followed, children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted.
And since we were a child, it's a wonderful thing: we'd play a damage, those who play a damage, things that stay in the memory of us in childhood, we'd look at the window, the landscape pass in a form of meditation, so today it's two sides and two stages for each one, if we can't do something in the car, right now, right?
(Laughter) Even in moments, where the child needs more money, this exists, this comes from the weapons, you can go there, punish the hypothesis.
This is the name, IPOR, and I still come with a layer to cover the tablet, and this is what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive, and this makes us confined our children, and prevented them from the fact that they are more important for us, creativity and imagination, and we are pushing the confinement of permanent distraction.
In April, there are four hours of television per day, it's massacred by advertising, it's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because we have less time in school.
And then, in the weekends, of course, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program of the Brazilian family at the weekend, which is O.
Very well, but it will be more massacred by advertising, by consumption products, and this advertisement is a covard for characters, making it fall in love with obsessive consumption.
The hyper-valorization of appearance.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree.
In obesity, it's going to disagree, even in the consumption of glasses, we know that the beer in Brazil is not an alcoholic drink, it's totally liberated, and, obviously, those who need friendships are the teenagers, and they are profoundly affected by the child's consumption.
Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want her to be competitive, an adult of a lot of success, and her agenda gets full of commitments, to relax from this stress, and they increase a class of meditation.
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: "Who's already in the middle of the balance, look at the sky, look at the floor..." (Laughter) There's no beautiful meditation, which is this one.
Ronga is money with a class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, in desertion, that uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization, which is based on machismo, the objectification of women, in the excessive value of appearance and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their heads completely when they've been eight or ten years old, this is the date of the end of childhood and the erotization for what?
Gabriela has parents who are afraid of her, because they don't live with her, so instead of limiting them, they put them in a trunk, she passes to be the queen of the family, and not the member of the family, she earns many gifts, and when she needed, she was present.
And she realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, she needs people who lead her life, this generates taste and generates symptoms, and we know that it's important for our children, and we're losing this ability, instead of this, we're doing what the Americans call "Helicopstraperinting."
We interrupt ourselves between children's experiences and the world, making them not that they don't have the experience of life, and therefore they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver them later, this is the peculiar.
From the internalization and the superproduction of the infancy, well, before so many problems, it's clear that the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, shine, belt, and will eat too much, or be obese in school, it's not possible for these children in this way.
In the same way we take these poor children and put them on the chair.
That's the solution that we're not going to give to the bad-comported children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, the medicalization, we're going to give medicine and the worst fish.
Kin, from Mafalda, says this: "Take a wonderful way, they buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact, what the fact is that people are doing with these children, not only with the elastic children, adults in an overwhelming way.
Medicalization of the most popular phenomena, you see that in the United States, 15% of children today are willing to prepare this competitive and individualist society.
The three colors are the market that grows the most for depressive, we're arriving at this point, and the ritaline, the medicine of the medicine, which is for the disorder of attention and interactivity?
It sold in 1999 70,000 boxes, in 2010, more than 2 million boxes.
And this isn't the epidemic of disease, and it's a massacre against childhood, we're going back, normalizing, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, would have lost that of wonderful children that are at the same time.
So, we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but for the whole problem, complex of humanity, already said philosophers, there's always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
It's obvious.
But I want to propose a simple solution for you.
I think we reflect on this, a very useful solution to TEDx, I'm also going through my time, but it's OK, it's just a little.
A solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing.
In relation to time, what can we do, when we say "pecados," we're talking about penitence today, means "dismo," in almost all the churchs, the saying is to give a part of what we have the most precious to our childhood, our children, which are our sacred.
What do we have more precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
We have 17 waters.
These are 7 hours we have to dedicate to our children, 100 minutes.
This gives a lot of 40 per day, it's not very possible, it's just to priorize, and if we don't give, in the weekend, we start to connect in the weekends, it's possible to give time to live our children.
In relation to space.
I'd like to propose an exercise for you.
Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, my own self-confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, a bad place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not a good place to live.
Let's see this place.
How would he be?
Look at your eyes.
And they tell me if you fit in this statement.
Yes, right?
I'm sure most of you do.
And this shows us a little the importance of nature among us: nature is profoundly associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul, we know what makes us healthy, it's not medical, hospital, medicine, these factors, we all know this, what we don't know, and there's an interesting experience.
I started with the pattern behind, who wasn't giving me my presentation, and she said, "Wow, but you're talking about something incredible!"
I talked about the convergence, health and sustainability, and I didn't know that everything I do, good for me, is being good for nature for my environment, everything that makes good health and vice versa: riding a bike, making my body, my city, the pollution, the collective transport, makes good, for the time of coexistence, creating simple vicious, and the living rooms, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it is!
And when I say "levate Children for nature," we're not talking about spaces when boys with fat steps, "fitness," and now it's going to make people from the stars, it will give us a moment of awareness, especially for children, to reduce the consumption of immissive material, to be mental, and play in the squares.
To occupy public spaces, with games, with love, affection, with coexistence, there are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this.
And not only the initiative of physical use has been reinvented by public policies that facilitate us in contact with public space with nature, that promote psychology.
According to the free events of these spaces, the urbanization, the gardens in schools, the high cities, public transport to take these places, security.
Cessive and well-carded squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, it's the word occupied, practically used for citizens' resistance, and today, it means that occupy public space with joy, and, mainly, participate in the governance of the city.
To conclude, the same scientists who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, who is coming from there, will live very early, our children will take me full, also say, in 97% of scientific consciousness, there are many movements in Brazil, starting to do this, including who matters, and it's cool, we participate in this.
And taking children outside, taking the children to the square, to the water, to the invitation, to empathy, we're going to learn to take care of others, and we're going to reduce inequality, taking the children to nature.
We're going to do with those love and nature because only experimenting the ice cream, not seeing in YouTube, and we learn to love this box and defend it in the future, which we only defend what we love, so, in summary, this proposal will occupy public spaces with game, with games, with games, with participation.
It's this, and since we're talking about utopia, guys, I'm often showing myself in the Galiano phase that left us this year, unfortunately, he said that utopia is in the horizon.
And the more I get closer, the more it affects, if it approacts 1,000 steps, it affects 1,000 steps, so that it serves utopia exactly to make us walk.
What makes us walk outside?
AC: In 2007.
AC: I came across a big group of young and adults.
With disability, excluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge was to look and see people's efficiencies are marked by their disabilities.
So I created the Cafétherapeutic project, the group of parents, students and friends, searching for a really inclusive society.
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school, with parents.
With their children and with their partner.
AC: People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents.
Community.
It's in general.
People with disability.
AC: Sometimes they're left aside.
(Laughter) Let me have friends.
On the other hand, think they're not able.
I'm going to have friendship.
I wanted to interact with people.
Like the case of the Igor's student, for example, that in the other school he studied.
(Laughter) For four years he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
AC: And people didn't make an effort for that too.
So, over four years, he was in the court taking part in all the physical education classes and, as he loved running, he was running all the time.
When I got to Campulimpo, I sought to know the Igor in a global way.
I tried to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school, and what would we do together?
For him to be able.
They were better learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a place.
From despair.
Well, isn't it that it's a clean one?
Today, it's very happy.
AC: He has classes with several teachers.
There are many friends.
And he said I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on his parents' Day.
I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And it can teach the student to enjoy it.
The own learning.
Schools think.
That they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties, they need to use it.
And believe it.
(Laughter) They are capable and that these kids inside the school.
To do good for them.
It's going to do good for other students.
For school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others.
(Laughter) Why did I choose this?
I have what I know, I have what you know, and I have what we can learn together.
Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see.
I learned.
I said, "You know."
My hearing, living with people who don't hear.
I learned to value my legs.
With those who can't walk.
And I learned to appreciate my ideas with those that often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart and the heart of my students.
To create connections.
And friendship laps.
And the most important thing for society?
AC: It's learning the exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been to cook: when I was a child, I loved to see my grandmother cooking.
I'd cook, work in the kitchen, she'd take account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa, and she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hand in their hands, in fact, were my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen, and this is the answer I want to give to you today, because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I started to realize that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies and treatments of diseases, as a form of medicine.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics."
Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many young people.
which is the Cuidated zelo and respect for nature.
So I decided we could.
Changing the way we ...
I build the food system through food, and I believe...
It's one of the side effects of modernization.
It's the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's us.
Try a little of the rural life for the city, we can strengthen the laws between men and nature, for example, planting urban gardens, it's a way we can reconnect with nature.
And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food, food as a tool, not only to improve the quality of life in health terms, but also to improve, to use as a tool.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with that, we started.
It's to reestructure the food system, change the food dynamic.
The process of production, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example, there are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it is produced, the more cheap it produces.
The worst is quality, and the cycle of the animal is accelerated artificially, the animal's life cycle, it's accelerated artificially, and it loses its health and its time of life.
So, I believe that we can and should change this food system, I was the other day passing on the supermarket and realize that the kilo of Franco was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can this not enter my head?"
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the process of production in industrial scale is also a lot, each Brazilian consumes, in average, 5 kg of agrotóxic per year.
It's an exorbitant amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxisms, but even so they continue to tolerate this abuse in the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer is why our current society.
There are inverted values, there's an alergic reaction, because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal, right?
And why is that?
So, I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values, and we need to teach people.
To appreciate the organic products, because when you buy a well-being of the producer, which is something that people don't know that behind that alphace, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
(Laughter) That's why I ...
I think you must know that we produce a lot of food, in terms of distribution, it's not efficient for the culinary and nutrition.
It's simply desperate, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why there are people still passionate about hunger, and the reason is a "mapolitics of distribution," we have to reverse this.
And in terms of consumption consumption, the way we consume today's food is scary: my grandmother is paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
What if I took her to put her in the middle of the Paulista Avenue?
I'm sure it's very scared, seeing those executives, or those pressed people walking on the street, talking about the cell phone, swimming a piece of pizza, for example, because it's also very important, but it doesn't recognize that as a way of reflection, like a form of feeding yourself.
And it's...
And then?
These Food Foods, these quick foods, were made the same way, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about our art, clanding, watching TV, and this makes us lose the notion of society, or we end up opening space to Google, which is very harmful for our health.
So we need to reveal the way we consume food.
And these biscuits, and so on, have many chemical addictions, and a level exaggerated of nervous system, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
Who here still makes jokes, instead of buying that small pack of panels, that pack of panels in the microwaves, look, half a half, (Laughter) and who still makes a small pack of panels, also half a half a half, huh?
This question may seem a bit harmful, I don't want to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, just to exchange your health, because you're consuming chemical chemicals that you wouldn't put in your panels, and you're also polluting with the package of panels.
So, to summarize this question of food production, I think that this dynamic of feeding this food system is not healthy, it's not working, and we must change, but how to change, right?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
To cook.
It's this name of art, culture, pleasure, health.
To cook brings independence, brings self-knowledge, brings autonomy, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, someone will cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry.
Because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes, so if you leave the industry feed you.
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What about a pizza?
And it's about scripts, because not even Pizza, we know how to do more, right?
So I believe we're ...
(Applause)
I think there are many people who don't have the price for the kitchen must think that making food is very harmful, very anti-pratic, it's loss of time, but, for example, if you leave the mirror of each day, that keeps our belly and our soul.
It's still frozen for the rest of the week, gathering with a fresh street that you do in 20 or 30 minutes, more the legumes you've already cut and washed in the refrigerator, and in the midst of now you have the ready reflection.
This would be perhaps the same time you would take to wait the pizza to get there.
Esperal of Pizza's book.
So, I believe we must change.
It's the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook: man, woman.
There's no age, there's no sex, girl, child, adult, soft, sex, there's no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education, we teach children to take the fair children to choose the vegetables that will have to dinner, putting children to dedicate a battle, the value.
Simple things in our daily lives, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic vision of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Because many people think it's from the supermarket shelter, so we're children good.
I believe we have to change the food dynamic, we have to value the food more, value the act, growing food, a healthy food, they will grow independent of the pharmaceutic industry, because they will be much less sick.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to leave, education doesn't mean.
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us.
It has less hospitals, this is education, education and prevention, so ...
The future of food.
It will decide the future of humanity.
cooking.
And choosing good food is choices we can do to change the world better.
Thank you.
Life is not the one we live in.
AC: But is it that we remember?
And how do you wake up to tell?
It's here in the background.
To talk about the transforming power of stories, it's to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family came here, I came here, when I was a child, to spend vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My grandmother, Mari Güeyuça, was the first tribe plantator of the mechanized work in Brazil, here in the earths of Butiá.
For me, and then, he got married with my grandmother Tília and, after having my five siblings, I got to this world, casually, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago.
These are the stories we tell, that make us be who we are, and we want to change, but we are our history, before looking at this future, we need to see.
Those who come back and honor all stories.
Even my passion for stories started very early, I've always liked to write, to read, to tell.
In school, I even wrote a book called "Scaminhos," which talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened, this book helped me live the mourning, so having told this story to me one of the most beautiful things about this.
That it's the power that people can feel welcomed in the other's history, feel in the colore of each one's stories.
So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us, that I wrote stories, reports, 15, 30 seconds, about products, but from then on, one day I knew this whole world here, from TEDx, I met incredible people, because the world of advertising had already been very small to me.
So I started to do, if one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable today, but he brought me another challenge.
That she talked about bubble, because that was what he always suffered, and he wanted to share the story with others, and I left him because he had to do with the subject, but I had water.
(Laughter) While we prepared to talk about it, he always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints with the right.
Especially what they had done with him, but what's the goal of telling a story, being to keep complaining who did that with us, and otherwise, to inspire people that they can accept who they are, how we've already said, without fear?
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time about bullying, about acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, the people I know they know, also to have seen that the rod they imagined that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great defense.
And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story a lot of people.
He welcomes me in his story, the week went by, he sent me a audio saying that many boys have sought him, even more in the air.
At the time, it's so expensive to dialogue and acceptance.
And I hadn't assumed this for people in a way that I didn't have any shame, now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story to tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story, that they wanted to share with them the problems that were going through in their families, so tell stories to me.
These are micro-revolutions in our lives.
There are many, not only in them, but also in my own of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear, we change ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this for seven years, training many people to be here in this place.
But if there's no rule, there's the hypothesis about how to start, there's a funny question, it shows the picture of your children, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important, and for me, if there's no formula, there's a big rule.
It has to come from the heart, and to talk about the heart, you have to have a lot of courage, and it's not the roof that courage has the heart color.
That's it.
I told the story of Ave, the avenue, the teacher of the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening, and we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDx Laçador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day, two weeks before his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "Let's discover what's wrong with it."
Every time you talk to me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head: when, in fact, you have to leave everything here, you have to be in the heart, and it changed everything.
And one day, he gave an incredible talk about the listening, about the importance of listening to the other, and how was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the person, when he had cancer.
Because he told me, and we're afraid of transforming ourselves, we're afraid of changing, although the word "madic" here is that we're going to change, and that's him who taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count, so we talk about change.
There's always this fear, and as we always get there and say.
I'm not going to listen to us and to others.
And listening also comes, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy, but we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time for people.
Because we are worried about our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
And this, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx.
(Audience) More.
MA: And empathy?
(Laughter) There's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 stories of the most varied ones I listened to.
Follow all the others.
For example, when we say on the street, many of us, that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, we have, we have at least a smile, and it doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others, we truly transform ourselves.
What about this other?
Listen and tell it too, it becomes... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do high, many people asked me, "But Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?"
I'd like to free many of the people I know, to give her the key to their lives, of the fourth of the flaws, of the values, of the kitchen, of the uncertainty, I'd like to free many of the people I know, and for everyone to come from a poem that I even wrote, and that now I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Liberating fear means that many people I know had at least one minute of rest, then could look at the side and go back to smiling, saying they have the right to change, the right to change, the right to love, not to love, between 65 days a year, 24 hours a day.
And you, what stories are you going to tell about your life, what stories do you want to tell about you?
Thank you.
The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, where there are all kinds of stars and stars, they don't pull roles or classify them, they're only belonging to their plural spaces, there's no fat or magician, rich or poor, they are only elected to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender who was attributed to her at the moment she was born.
I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life.
And that's exactly why I wanted this poem, because he does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the star already in the sky, the universe is infinite, no one was covered or the beauty of the other.
So, why is it that we, here below, so small, can't reproduce something so simple, that accepting empathy and understanding definitely that the difference adds?
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal.
And this is rich, that's why we have the privilege, and the opportunity to be different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives, so that's why we allow ourselves to know something or someone different from you.
AC: Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a cape flight, where I could be myself, where I laughed, where I cried in my body, where I questioned God, why I was different.
Well, the bathroom transformed into the best friend.
He was always there, after a replete of bullying, or when I wanted to put his place in his head and dance rebeldes because I only rewarded until today.
But the question is: what was in the bathroom that didn't have other places and that was denied to me, or better, why was it necessary for me to have this freedom and simple answer, made of being different?
From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this artistic society, where I had the opportunity to know myself inside, theater showed me in the world, and it was a divisor of water in my life, it was in theater that I learned to deal with the difference, it was in theater that lack of information, and when it was about the wrong way, it was as if you entered a cash, it was a time there, and it was a beautiful turning line.
That's why this process has more difficult phases, we go through many daily tests, and if you're a black woman, fat, this most difficult path, you still have to learn to deal with the acceptance of others, there's a lot of empathy in this world, in the case of us, for example.
People think I'm a phase.
They bother each other with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen, so they ask, "But come, do you really bring new things?" No, "No, you're so easy, it's going to pass?"
FR: People.
Who are the choices and the life expectancy of 35 years?
And there's something crazy here, "Do you want to see your teeth?"
While men exist, have their life expectancy of 76.
Who are aware, chooses to live in the country that kills trans people all over the world?
And I wouldn't choose that.
I said, "So?
They question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the National Association of transvestite Women said that we, transsexual women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed.
And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, in the 44 people who were killed here in Brazil, in 2016, facing 21 deaths in the United States, there is no choice, but in a life condition that we could measure the best panel, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a way of disconstruction of ideas to establish about myself, after I finally found that I was, after I finally found that my essence, I was invited to live a trans person in TUB, and in the absence of life, for each one of us, it can definitely change the world, and I was becoming a reference for many people.
It's more responsibility.
It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went out of my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like macho, shown, showing, "You'll never be a woman, die, what doesn't have a price."
What doesn't have a price is to receive a message of mothers from other trans girls, thank me.
Because of teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best message of other trans girls, with brilliant eyes, thank me for seeing me there and seeing me, this has no price.
Understanding the difference is someone who can definitely change the world.
But I also understand that I don't want to be just a stranger.
Translation is only a small part of what I am.
I'm far beyond this, I'm too late.
But to understand this, I take a test of knowledge, I really need to understand that we are many, we are plural beings, the agreek difference.
The sky is the refugee of the salty beings.
Who was me, a being there?
A blue immensity, freedom without limits: me and the sky, the sky and me.
I've already delivered my corridors, not more looks, I don't ask myself to stop, but they remain their scars.
But the future, what the future promises, which marks my soul, is what I want: a side, now I'm, now I'll fly, I'll go.
(Applause) I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've been doing work with children and hospitals, children with cancer.
A beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we opened our heads, we opened the belly to get tumors and it won't be able to explain to children what cancer was, what in the treatment, the protocols, the procedures would be like."
(Laughter) Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate, I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
(Laughter) I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point, nothing, and it was with a surgery of two hours of a simple procedure, I woke up ten hours later and I didn't have it, and I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's outside the visited time."
So I asked her to handle me.
Until I slept, I just cut it in the room.
I used cancer, metastasis, and committed gangs.
(Laughter) I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because after all, I didn't realize it.
(Laughter) It wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
(Laughter)
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites.
And the only thing that was the safe information at that moment is that I would die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
And then, in that time, I was realizing so much information.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone if you can't even say the word "cancer"?
And I was a doll.
And I opened what bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were donating my hair to help me.
So, at that moment, I realized this information of society to graduate in hair, in fact, the surgery wasn't for me, the worst for them, that I wasn't able to see myself a doll.
And with that, I saw several other information that I thought it wasn't the most adequate.
When I entered the hospital, Careca, I got from you, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer, children said, "Wow, you'll be a hair to stay like us, I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I don't get it."
But the players overwhelmed and the children started talking about procedures, which, in this kit, came a sabonete, a cow of teeth, but also a shampoo, a touch, and a pent.
And I didn't have hair.
And this, for me, is information, and I started photographing the procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent to the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through it, and what happened to me, the children started to give me their procedures."
(Laughter) So they showed me, sent videos, working, chemotherapy, going through radio, several procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we were playing, but when we explained that chemotherapy caused the fall of hair, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong remedy, that's why it falls fast, like the cells of the hair, they understood, and they still say, "Oh, it's working!"
And one day the doctors started to talk a lot about procedures, and we started to engage the children, and we started to talk a lot about the procedures.
If there's a patient who's going to put an athlete, if you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs," "Oh, but then I have a patient who's going to put a leg, it's focused on the patient, he's in the middle, and we's in the health professionals, and our creative friends, and we're in the middle of the process."
So we put children to work.
So we'd spend a lot of time listing what we thought could improve, what we'd doubt, what we couldn't understand that doctors talked about, but with a very important thing: sometimes, as something seems, you don't need to be explained, when you like someone, and you write, I love with the heart, you draw the ventricles.
I think it's good, so we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes: these terms came out of our first material, which was a guide; this guide is to distribute to 3,000 guides per year if we had a patrocinator in the audience.
(Laughter) We have, for 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: hospitals started to use, they started to ask, children from New Zealand, Japan, several places, and I'd say, "But there's a Portuguese," but we have a translator, and the guide is very asked in the northern northern northern order, because children and we have to give up and engage the patient.
And to make several other actions.
The information, guys, is very important, and the information sometimes isn't only that thing, the technology of information, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotic modernity, sometimes the information is a pent in a kit, so what we say, and we prepare.
That if you need information in everything, for example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, children, dolls, earn much more present, and pay attention to what the hair is, but sometimes the child is careful, or there's something at some point.
And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
When I was in treatment, you have that society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if putting a kid, shake, sad, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money, but you can look at the website of Biabax, there's no.
And what happens with this is that when you're the patient, how many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home, will I get to this internship to see what a difficulty is?"
OK, the mother wants to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there's a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window, to see, and with a good life, and at that time we need self-esteem, you only have information that put you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
Because we think it's very important.
I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Fortunately, it's not easy because it's the dependence here in my disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
But what if, in fact, if the answer is inside us to treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients have reason?
It's in the search of this that we thought about many things, and one of these things is in our own organism, one of these defense defenses, which can be protected by big threats, it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain and don't do bad for our heads.
Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier, they are very small molecules, and for being very small, they have a almost balanced passage for the ematoencephalic barrier, and that's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain in the circus of recompense in another circuit.
But we also have another system of protection, which is very important, which is our immune system.
Our immune system is composed by cells, anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria and viruses and substances as well.
Well, then, can't we add these two things to try to help our patients, two defense mechanisms, which are innate, which are us?
A few years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day when some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using big drugs, they produced anticops against their own drug.
It's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
Stop, it's enough.
AC: You don't need drugs in the system, you're overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use this immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients.
(Laughter) Yes, my team.
A few years ago, we're researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system, a message of hope.
(Laughter) In other words, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to win again their freedom and control it.
How does this substance work? This substance is located in our organism, it makes our immune system produce anticops, and anti-coffs are large molecules, and then that problem that the barrier really leaves disorders, because when the user...
It's consuming drugs, this little molecule connects itself to a big molecule, and "pum," it's no longer on the bottom of the cefarium.
And look at this image here, how is this beautiful process, OK?
Here, the right to you?
We have a while that didn't receive the vaccine, these white dots you're seeing, it's a doll molecule still marked with radiation.
(Laughter) When these rats aren't immunized, they receive this cocaine marked by radiation, it freely passes and accumulates in the brain of these animals, and then you see on the left side of you, there's a very significant decrease decoration of the white dots in the animal brain.
Besides that, we asked ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that vaccinated rats have a concentration of radiation radiation much bigger in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated and indicating that, besides blocking, drugs were arrested in a blood fabric.
The other very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is the vaccine of therapy or vaccine, they have a behavior that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency.
Those who know that, a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time to decide if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much.
Let's go!
"I'm being."
A psychotherapist.
It's more than 40 years.
And I want to say that ...
Besides.
It's painful.
Audience: Wow!
Isn't it nice?
It's very difficult.
There's a trendy disease.
Well, everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
Who's ever said, "No, Pierre, go?
And me?
We're called "normal."
Patrology of normality.
And I have to say that ...
And maybe these ones, of encantation?
The big encounter of this TEDx.
In Saturday.
That's it.
No, the song is sitting.
Ponctuate from the beginning.
What is the nurse?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
And in some sense.
In some way.
The war?
Cool, for this, it's an example.
The most dead.
What is love.
Or even where I can understand, there are two foundations.
The most important of the norm is the situation.
Systendio.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
From respect to the fact that the norm has always existed.
Not always, it will exist, nor is it a typical disease?
What about moments?
I said, "What?"
And we live in a context.
Where predominates?
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility, of predominating corruption.
Disumanity, in its word, is egocentrism.
So, is it normal?
This is to adapt to a sick and maintain system.
I've been.
Is it a worker?
About 30 years ago.
From the International University of Paz.
It's the only step.
And people think that peace is in the good one.
What happens is the absence of conflicts.
I said, "No.
"Dad, it's good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars, Perei, who came here, a little bit of payment.
The one who's military for peace.
But for other areas.
The weapons of the responsibility.
Is love compatible?
So ...
It's the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The healthy person is the one who has the ability to present symptoms.
"So, but with you?
Sometimes it's even...
A conscious, light despair.
A indignation?
Juste.
This makes me remember.
From a family word, "When my daughter is Isabel, she's five years old, and today she's 34.
And there's a 8-year-old boy.
The mother asked, "What's the princess you like the most?"
Is Gata bolira, Cinderella?
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought.
And he answered.
And I like all May's written.
And I too.
And I too.
I respect many people who say more.
Sometimes because it has to be the same to feel.
The own skin.
I love contradictions.
People who looked for me with panic disease, for example, all of them.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
That they captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear, is it the fear of a family system?
Is it a method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction?
It's the fear of animals.
I feel disimate.
Of forests.
They're desertified, and these people say, "Dad!
My respect is the world.
People denominated by psychotics and neurotics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten themselves.
The people who are considered crazy are also considered blood.
Because they are like a paradise that captures cultural contradictions.
Systemic, and sometimes it's not fragile.
And how did I say it?
I said, "Lengue!
The difference between them.
A santo and a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where others don't know.
And he doesn't say anything.
Maybe these people, at least in a large measure, that we call psychiatric, are saints to hunt.
And I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consciousness, a dream.
The problem is in the atmosphere, it's the people who don't care.
It's a dehumanity.
So, I think of a occasion that I came from a similar to here, from Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, when I knew I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
He's kind.
He gets up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing, he's good.
It's target of bullying.
People get rid of it, my son, what do I do with my son, he's good?
I don't know if you understand.
What am I trying to say?
It became a lunch.
So ...
I have to say that all the people I have.
Respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team organized this encounter.
That nothing against the correctness.
At that moment, "Oh!
What is suffering from a desert?
So ...
You talked about the norms, the machismo, the racism, the homophobia.
From diverse ones.
Exclusions.
In harmony.
We could say, "No, it's environmental."
The nurse of ultra-specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing.
No, no.
And the salt of Torta takes fire, and each one is looking at the minimum, it doesn't realize, its existence doesn't make sense, we're using it.
In an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
To do the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe that's it.
Let's do a concept.
It's in this education that has also been here.
Pontaneous.
As I feel a possibility of solution that I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
From the desire that brought us to the Internet.
It's what brings us in a stage.
It's because we're making a promise that we're saying.
We don't see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
And only you can tell yourself if you didn't count, she would lose.
"So?
The nurse's foundation?
I don't know.
The situation.
There's another.
It's very important.
It's the evolution, it's also been said today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates the human species of other species?
What differentiates us?
G.G.
A bird of a snake, of a monkey?
I ask a friend, "Wow, give a space."
Is it an alternative Nobel Prize, an economy?
From developing country, Max, Life, Chilean.
When I met my dulce, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know that the human being was disturbing from other species: "Intelligence, no, language, no, it's culture, it's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father, that very respected world of his father said.
Isn't it stupid?
He assisted a little light, he said he became the first stupid.
The stupidology is a science that we need to study.
It differentiates itself, for example, of imbecility.
Audience: Yes.
It's absolutely...
And one day, I like to remember the slower, a creator of violence, a big brother, and he told us that it's necessary to be a hypotalamic idiot, to be a good animal, of the areas for the short brain.
The question is stupid, because it revers itself of rationality, a person can be highly stupid, and it's highly.
Rational.
To have diplomas and qualified universities.
And to do as a person who is talking about development with graphs, sophisticated, like a person sitting in the garbage of a tree, closing.
"So."
"Nice," she also said.
That for him only had it.
Two things are infinite.
The universe in human stupidity.
And she grew up, Einstein.
With relation to the universe, I still have the same.
But I need to say that I discourse.
They're pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, from the north museum of Einstein and Max nephing, and considering that human beings ...
We were born to be, to cry, not from your nature, stupidity, but on the contrary, to serve, then.
I prefer to think of a confusion.
In 2600 years, what differentiates our species of other species is inaccabation, it's in complete, we don't born human beings.
And we do ourselves humans.
But treating a kid is born, being tired, you've seen it, and go to the sea, "We don't."
We are born inaccabated, that's why saying confuse, human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
School for Tarugas, or for Tana Juras?
It's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul, the psychiatrist, developing emotional intelligence, the unionic intelligence of dreams, it seems that it's only about developing a rational testing, not to learn to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concensional?
To develop consciousness of where to play the values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
He summarized like this.
Your long exist.
At the age of 15, I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
It's 40.
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
At 50s, I knew which were the fears of the sky.
When I was obsessed, I listened to my elderly.
At the 70s, I could follow the indications of my own heart because what I wanted, no longer that day, the borders of justice.
Is the same as the European therapists in Alexandria?
Two thousand years ago, you exchange clothes and five minutes, take a whole existence to exchange color.
And this is the task, in this sense.
The nurse refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be human beings.
Now, the opposite case, the question: Is there 21st century for the human being?
It's nothing less than this against this game.
In the future.
The new generations.
So ...
The norm is terrible because it's not anxious, it's in silences, people don't realize it.
It's not easy, you become a human being.
David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being, as Tia Chartan said, is the space where his own nature can learn to know each other, to smile, to smell.
Has anyone asked for the IT?
Think about God.
And the IT.
I cried.
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a monastery in the big wine.
It's flowing.
What about human beings?
What potentially?
I'm.
So, that's it.
"I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to doesn't happen.
For more than 30 years, Betinho learned the knowledge of this story.
It was once.
What is it?
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let it flow."
That took a source, a water drop, and played in the fire's nest, and it was resiliently turning the other drop.
He was playing in the middle of the fire, and he came back with patience.
The wings are already burned.
I'd play in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, see, flow?"
Do you think that with these little ridiculous, will you turn off this infernal fire?
And I said, "I know it's not.
We listen to everything.
Now, I'm doing my part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary, people who want to change the world of society.
Even with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way, because there are hundreds of people who are transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order, a little of love.
In this little pedacy of the world that the big world confies each one of us, and if we don't do this, where could we be transforming facilitators?
That's why revolutions.
He failed and continued failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
It means breathing, consciousness.
I manage with others, with others, with the world and with mystery.
I recommend a book: "The Korean of Marily Fex."
He studied a lot, these spontaneous, institutional movements, from a giant narrative.
Flow bee doesn't have any ideology, it doesn't have flags, it's not cutting anyone, it's pushing anyone, it's part of it, that's what we can do.
We can stay standing.
And we can do our part, by the way.
Since tomorrow, I'm seeing beija-flores who see each one talking about their water.
And all of you who are in this room.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you're in this stage, but in the stage, there's your life story.
Tell your story.
And taking it?
Your drop had water, because we can always assemble a candle.
Instead, it's just complaining about darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
It's time.
of renown.
I love it.
That's it.
I grew up.
GG: Let's read.
Love with passive and poetry.
Still saving the world.
I want to conclude with the poem of Cecília, well.
Renova.
It's born old.
Multiply your eyes to see more.
Multiply has arms to scenarios everything.
Stories, eyes that have seen you, create others for other visions.
Destrons, arms, who have this meat.
so that they forget to run.
Being always the same.
Always the other.
It's easier.
Alto.
It's always far.
And inside.
That's it.
Between a good school.
It decorates.
I took good grades, no.
