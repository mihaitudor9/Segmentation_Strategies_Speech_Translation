(Applause)
Have you ever stopped to think?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
Is there any difference?
Or should I have my role as an inclusive way stylist?
Is it to create a vestuary?
That's the hug of everyone.
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue move me so much?
Everything started in 2009.
When I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
From the vestuary?
For wheelchair women.
Then I talked to it.
With different women, even with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one...
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
It's time when they lost a lot of time.
I lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations...
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist ...
That was it.
Making clothes ...
For everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It's from one, a challenge, with other women without disability.
And I did it.
A cause with high-cost, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil.
To facilitate the dress of the piece's breast.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface.
Obviously, I didn't put bags on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities.
To unfill with another without disability?
And I did it for Carlena?
A light that had openings in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button.
To facilitate the time to go through our heads.
In fact?
For people who are quadriplegics, ideal.
It's thinking of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women.
With and without disability?
And for pattern?
I made a website.
I came in ergonomic, I've done it in the sitting position.
To give more comfort.
She says it's visually impaired.
I did a dress that she could use in many ways.
On top to the bottom, below the top, irreversible, and I wrote the name of Alembrae.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that would use in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal ...
It would always be to think about making tags and labels in Braille for people to have access to some basic information.
Like size and color of the piece.
"So, what about it?"
Isn't it anyway?
And for women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
We launched pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued.
This is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news?
Women are already thinking about it.
They are producing more modern products.
Like colorful wheels chairs.
Stop prostheses?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world.
It's already in the last edition.
I left the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
What about me?
Silvana ...
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
What are the big companies?
Famous and conceived brands that realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections.
"How does American take?"
And it's already in your second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at others.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Why will we be?
All equals.
Our differences.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
My family has always come from the rock.
I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life?
The middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
It was working with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it will pass through adults.
My community started to work with a record.
I was designing people, "How?
What's this about?
To know how to separate the other's trash.
So I tried.
Starting with children?
It was winning parents' awareness.
"Dad, did you get it?"
Do you deliver me to children?
Do you recognize me in the community?
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate.
But today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community ...
We have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
I'm going to work with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
"Yes."
I met a plant called her name of Engar.
It's a light plant.
We plant everything.
Below, is it a plant that recovers the soil's fast?
All kinds of plants like this.
How much below it?
Are we?
There's a good result.
And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met.
All plants.
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
So, do you have to imitate the forest?
"Why?"
"Ana brapa."
I had a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them.
It's various.
(Laughter) There I have the exit, the graviol, Andiromba, Copaíba.
I said, "Maru."
It's time to love.
Everything, there, doesn't give up.
"Light, eat?"
There, all natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
"Mom, brave."
And the fruit on the side?
The recovery of our own.
In our community?
We work there, everything is organic.
Everything is natural.
There's no toxin in our communities.
"Me?"
Are you ready for your brother?
Like an animal.
The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
She talks, she stays listening, and then she goes through another child.
The potato was there and was listening to this attention.
Then he talks to the animal quote.
So, I compare children like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
"Mom, I've cared for those children."
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
It was putting everything in the eye.
What's going to say?
The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
Is it a person?
And I observed my house.
What was I observing my house?
I saw that my wife always likes everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So, I saw that all this made my work, who was doing with children?
It's absurd.
And it's OK.
And today we have ...
A job inside?
It's far from the human being.
"Shut up, don't you take it?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, "Why don't you know what's far from the human being?"
Taruga da Amazônia.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And are we repowering the river that before?
I had a dam.
In front of you.
It's like this a little of our community.
And ...
This hooligan exploded.
It ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're achieving.
Living with nature.
To understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
I went through this person.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
The forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel.
It's typical.
They turn into a pure air there.
So, me, my experience in the forest?
Is it always talking to people educating children?
And ...
What's going through other people?
And I have the message to leave here.
The phrase she's very little?
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, do you know people?
Come to ...
Are we closer to us?
Are we talking about it and allowing people?
And I'm very happy.
I'm yours, if I don't pass.
My message, my education for other people, I even feel guilty.
(Applause) Thank you very much, guys. (Applause) Thank you very much.
(Music) I'm gay.
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children.
It's very proud.
In my family, it's very grateful, those women who helped us.
To make this dream come true.
To create this family.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that's it.
It puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you're here, as we feel.
It's like a fear that loses our child.
And we had two options.
You just have to fly, cry, or...
To solve, fight.
Creating, faith, strength, and continuing looking for an ossean medule.
To get there.
For him, being able to do a transplant of the metro, what he needs to do.
It's a peculiar one.
From then on.
It was very incredible because all the more in school and all the more friends, ours.
They made a whole movement.
Very big, sharing the press, social networks, everywhere, raising people, touching blood, funding medule.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
All this movement made us think that another secret through this disease.
It brought us a very important message for all of us.
First for us and for the rest of the world.
The first message.
That's it.
When a child gives you leukemia and you risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns.
They don't matter.
Everything else doesn't have a relevance, it really matters.
Do we learn to be this lesson?
And did you spread for our friends, for more school, for society, people at Facebook?
Talking is true, it doesn't matter the problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, the fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
That's it.
And people?
They saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
A family that is called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families.
In the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be in the family, or a living father?
Or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is love for the family, that union, that's what gives strength.
What gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that the other thing happened to us.
This is the disease for the world.
"What?"
Neither blood, nor medule, anxiety.
We can manufacture them.
Our manufacture.
The blood is only blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human.
Or that highlight raised that awareness.
We have this ability.
Dedoing blood for those who need it, and knowing it's not just...
For someone who has a house, I don't know.
Tanga is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating Medula Ocea, driving as a dozen medula ossia, the chances of compatibility.
Between one pain and a patient, and one ...
About 100,000 people.
So, if you...
"Let's save life," it's as if the mega-senha was winning.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when a meat of stars...
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to save in my life, and that's what it is.
More beautiful, and what is the message?
Or is it so credible?
It happens to us all, so I thank you all.
That's it.
Or supporting us for that union that we are not feeling, that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that awareness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
She slept in Laikon.
It's good for you.
Be it like you.
This is deafness.
Two here.
My name is Talola El Chinão.
It's serious.
It was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I'm an engineer.
I studied at Damasco's enthusiasm.
Today.
I'm fixed.
Not Brazil.
With my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
"Hi, I'm a bit...
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
And that's what happens.
In some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today.
I'm going to talk about...
What bothers me the most.
"Brocanceto."
OK, there's a slam about.
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do as a slam.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
It's a garage.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was from Vinci.
Three million.
Debe people.
And I got it.
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three fingers of clothes.
Homo sculptorio of Engineering.
Two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamasca.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Have you seen?
For countries, like the United States.
Spain.
It's France.
Until one day.
It started the war.
March 15.
It was my 11.
Interal.
Hi.
I get to all the other cities.
In the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had the entrance, Vinci.
It's 25.
Pombas.
Forget it.
What a good thing!
And five years of war.
Mine the country, this one.
It's destroyed.
Thank you very much.
Those who know it were, thank you.
Carrica.
Oh, Cadava!
From your children.
They found...
Are you good?
Very moved and mutilated.
Or a bomb.
Familiars.
This will look.
And they didn't come back.
My last years.
In Syria, there were very difficult.
I didn't know if it was.
I know and it's going back home.
When did you go to work?
I saw my family again.
Or not?
Today.
Millions of Syrian.
They gave me everything.
They're dead or they've been refugee in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad.
When do we have to leave Syria?
"Wow, noise, relatives."
And our life brings you back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still lives there.
I don't know.
"You're going to see."
They, again.
To protect my family.
I went to Barraba Irute.
Well, ten months ...
It's about that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
"So?
I went to talk to Baixada Brasileira.
And desired.
Nampaolo.
It was the best city.
To go.
In Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
It was in Pinas.
A week to leave behind.
For 40 years.
From my life?
And that's how I say new.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family.
Two children.
Oriald, 11 years old.
That was it.
As a result, today I have a daughter.
"Brazilian."
The Sara.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party.
To celebrate.
The birthday of my children.
They all talked very well.
The food that my wife did.
Palara, Bara.
I'll tell you what the kitchen is.
That's OK.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created Dagina no Facebook or Talal with my Syria, that's why now.
Everything has a pen and paper.
It's a number, it's palacy, it's Syrian (Applause)
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
(Laughter)
We are happy in Brazil.
We thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened doors when the world...
I was closed.
For us.
Etrest, who, on the end of the war and attacks.
Two terrorists.
Many people.
I had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow, here.
Or a journalist says, "I?"
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, talk.
Or contact?
Like OMABSOI.
Human beings.
Let's do it!
I slam likes blood.
That it's allowed to kill.
The name of religion.
But exactly ...
Or the bubble.
Or "attack," what happened in Paris?
It was a crime, not about French.
More, also, Branuse.
Or Syrian.
Islamic State is a terrorist organization.
It's suggesting the image of Islam.
A basic religion.
Or Alcurão?
I'm not a book.
Thank you very much.
In killing a person.
That she had killed another, hosted, corruption, on Earth, and how all men were killed.
And it's life!
It was like saying, "Life to all men."
Alcurão.
It lasts your mother to see school, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunitar.
How am I?
My life in Brazil ...
He showed me.
Can we?
To live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
Children of bright between Syrian.
It's Brazilians.
Even like the differences.
Culture and religion.
When do you see a woman using Ri Jabi?
That silence that I covered my hair.
Like, my wife, my wife.
They ask questions, "How?"
Why do you use excellence?
With this heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline Tirai Jabi.
Today, they have other rules.
Men in Molière.
"I'm not going to have to play."
A hug.
Immediate.
It's sex-so-so-de-boys.
The marriage.
Some people say to me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Bejamin is hug.
See me alone, so Slam has these rules.
Moreover, it goes from each person to want to eat, or not.
The debt is fine.
Robbia, some things to be.
It's the same way they have to be treated.
Those who don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went from blood to Brazil, the doctor asked me, "So?
It's a alcohol baby.
Oh, it was sex!
Like more than a partner.
This is not happening to me.
"Why?"
Because these things are exhausted.
And Island?
Our religion is very important for us.
Please.
Despite not knowing Moisla.
And then?
That agency is explained to people like this.
Do you understand?
It's respect.
Or "Teacher, Mohameddez."
We must respect.
All religions.
That all people have the same value.
What should we have?
Beautiful.
With all.
It doesn't matter.
There were white people.
Negros.
Or Indians.
"Hi, Lanta bem-Desis."
We must help those who need it.
Everything has a Zaka nose.
And we moved.
Two, five, four hundred.
All our money for people.
More poor.
It's not a sadness.
Being poor are Muslims.
Crystalos, today.
I see you to learn more.
It's about Islam.
I'm sure.
That it was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
To end.
With "O-brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
And your children?
"Wow, power, grow."
Together, based.
What is molecule?
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life.
They come to recite my rhythms.
In the Sun of the Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always willing to not give up the love of those who always wait for the reach.
Those who always believe in their reach.
I don't even believe it, so I lose hope.
But in the daily lap, I know who they suffer.
"Let's do food, my salary ends, just like this race."
All the girl was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
The opportunity for service had a lot of hands.
Cozinheiro.
It's a fascinator.
What didn't hire me in the mall, I don't understand, if you put me so much to pay a secret course?
Who enters the office?
I said, "Dad, I've got a mistake, I've got it."
To clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation: Deo, ME, CT, IC, Donestics.
OK, I have many friends.
This is where these situations have already conformed, but I don't.
To use new areas.
Men gave me an opportunity.
And the lunch said to me.
Keep this corridor, go straight, turn the left, enter that little box that the vastor is suspicious, be welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011.
I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the website: domestic employee.
The page I created in Facebook.
The picture came up in July 2016.
This year hasn't completed four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at home, I was at home of vacation.
Last day by day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember all I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook, daily?
I don't know.
I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Menina, you can do Facebook, it's tomorrow, my new newspaper."
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind.
What I was a domestic employee for seven years.
And then I warned the guys, "Look at me, some stories, I'll start.
To bet on Facebook and use the hashtag and domestic employee.
For this case, other people have already gone through this too, compatible, and then I can keep following that everyone wrote.
We're always talking about the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos.
In 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food that I did.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
There was the bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, I compatted.
This first report on the Internet became very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page.
Because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last history, and not stories from today, 2016.
Imagine, there are less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I give interviews to several media.
Both the international media, the national media, London babies, television, Germany, and many others.
I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers.
I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose themselves, and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
The domestics are more valued, they earn more.
For hours, for hour, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces.
It's a job announcement that I titled "How abusive announces," for example.
A announcement I read.
It was for worker, to go to work for a second.
"The access."
From 8 am.
At 18.
winning 380 Brazilian reais.
The day, no, a week, much less.
Men.
380 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestic ones going through these conditions still today, there are domestics that are being prevented from feeding themselves.
And they don't earn value, they exist domestic.
Not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities.
I've always been there in the page.
More than seven years old.
There were several oppression stories.
However, in one single house ...
And I found something that I call humanized treatment.
And it's the rule, and soon when I arrived at her house.
I started cleaning, the consumption of everything I always did.
I entered a single library that had a gigantic library, and I always liked reading, but books, until today, cost very expensive.
And my domestic mother, my father, a wallet, didn't have the conditions to buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and started to shake up.
This became a daily practice, so what I did was arrive at her house, gathered everything rapidly, left half an hour to clean, to the TV.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting down deliciating myself with those books.
And to my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous.
Maybe "pálida," I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And knowing about the experiences I had already gone through last year.
I was very nervous, and then she sat there with me and said, "Wow, you have to be interested in studying, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a story teacher, since I was little, I read many books, I want to understand the story of the world."
And there she started to indicate several texts.
And in 2009, when I entered the university, I arrived to read at the university as well.
So, this is what I call "humanized treatment," in 2009, it was very difficult.
Counciling the university.
With the gangs, because I entered the university, everything was solved, no.
To pay the mensality.
And thanks to some teachers and various class friends.
They woke me up, I summarize some texts.
I need to enter the room to make proof that it's very difficult to concilate a totally heavy job.
It's the studies.
And then, for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the Brazilian traditional family to show that slavery hasn't yet ended.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool.
What else?
There was, in this world, a woman called Lao delina de Campos Melo, black woman like me.
And in the '60s, the first symptom of domestics was created.
She was known by the media of the time as the land of the patterns.
All of this when I eat and exhibit some stories?
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy."
Anyway, today, I came here to generate discomfort.
Why do I believe it?
Just through discomfort that we can change some things.
No one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
Isn't it?
And why?
The great majority of workers.
Domestic in Brazil: 796%.
According to 2013, women are black women.
And this one ...
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one, yes.
Fifty and three percent of the population is also black, right?
I was in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black woman.
What am I saying is to be a publisher?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic.
When I got there to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I stayed without understanding, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
How much do I work in the family houses here in Brazil?
I would also pass.
Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum ...
Without photos, they called me, at least, a interview.
They called a suspicious, and this after a format, OK?
They took dirt to see my experiences, to have established this, that and so on.
"And then, are you?"
"Yes."
Or, "I'm magic."
(Laughter) (Applause)
I say that what was the big house in the past?
These are the apartments of luxury today.
They were domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not so far away, it's quite close to us.
They are domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's almost the case of employee.
She arrived.
I ran away, and I was nervous because I was waiting for her a long time to get there, "You're on the beach day, I hear her entering the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came."
And then, when I get there...
She's already with the clothes away, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says,
It was so bad, "Wow, I forgot to take your money on Monday Tipago."
The modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her.
All the needs she spent and suffered, I, who was there, I only wanted to see her marrying, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage, but, as I'm daring.
I put my best clothes.
I went to the church, I stayed there hidden, and I posted to see my girl marrying, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, it's Christmas, I'm seeing my family of my dress pattern, everyone happy.
I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because the modern Cesala ...
It's almost the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work.
He'll work, he takes his wife to work.
Go to his wife who's going to work, but he returns.
What's the house?
To welcome me.
And the only solution I had was to take part in all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and so I can flee from his seeds.
Because when I say I'm going to change my friends and say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,700 Brazilian reais a month?"
You'll never win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children on a northeast, and they need this money.
What modern senzala is?
It's the little box of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of sorvete.
The little green mouse is my penic.
And then I was there.
In the service line, pressed, I picked my little bit of sovet.
That's the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?"
Using the little pot of knowing if I use the bathroom, what's happening, not your bathroom can use, not because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee for that I brought little.
What is modern senzala?
It's the little box of the employee.
Today I'm here.
Unlike statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine.
Because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be happy where you are."
Your grandmother wasn't a domestic, only the mother wasn't a domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So, you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda, rapper, peripheric ... (Applause)
(Applause) Women are black.
Hello.
Thank you.
Hello!
I'm not here today.
Fortunately, there are 6 million domestic women.
"What should I be here on my side?"
At some point, they will be.
Everything I do?
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But just to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, many patterns, and some domestic ones.
I don't know.
And each one gives this idea of talking and humanizing relationships.
We decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestics work and study, and here, this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why does babies have to be dressed as white?
It's a uniform, yes, to be able to identify it, and so, inside the house, does the pattern not know it's a nanny, but it's to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country?
So I'm here in the statistics, I'm not alone, I'm talking to six million domestic women.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
And today, to talk ...
Thank you very much.
Silence.
And it's already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
Let me tell you.
At the time of my talk, first to discuss yourself.
Follow your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
I'm scared.
If you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Let's see who says that silence is a entrance door for those we are.
Emotionally.
Who are we emotionally?
Who are we really?
If you don't allow yourself ...
To look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was deceived in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
In the stage, I was already very inflamed.
Have you ever started?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another one in this aunt.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco."
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
I followed.
And I had it.
Thirty years ago, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize it.
It started.
Open the word.
That's what I look at.
It's safe, with equipment.
Put the inflammation points.
The first past to destroy.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level.
And it's the certainty that I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
And I'd say, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door to a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I've never had it.
It was my present state.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
And it's the moment you're not.
The consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation that you have in front of you.
It's you.
It's human.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
There's no credit, no sex.
It's a human being.
It's time I put my hair inside, guys.
I found ...
It was fear.
It's much less.
It was very angry.
It's not in the heart.
It was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
And I didn't know that I lived in a big deal.
They were the consequence of history.
Everything I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
I loved it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to delegate your cell phone.
Do you remember?
Most of you?
She stood her gold."
Several of you?
It's going to happen.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you.
Take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me.
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
"Deslige."
Come this space.
It's not to get rid of you, it's slow.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor ... (Laughter)
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close them.
And you, who were putting our notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything?
I closed.
You are not connected.
You took close to you, the tool.
It's a matter of connection.
Who connects themselves is the human being?
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back.
Look at me.
Look.
Propal.
And then, look!
For the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Let's look at it in the face of this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss.
(Laughter)
He was connected, guys.
Let's see people.
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you read it?
Did you see?
Audience: Yes!
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands in your hands.
Wow, the legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are you really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
"Are you afraid?"
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
The fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at the closed eyes.
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember this...
From the approximate dimensions to the salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
It's a natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
Does it make sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Half of you.
He was scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are.
Feel the chair.
Do you remember when you were children?
Do you take your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touching Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected.
And feeling where are you?
It's true, yes.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
What do you occupy?
In this room.
Be careful.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
It's in front of the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
It's strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality.
It's new.
Like it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence?
It's realizing it.
And a lot of what we do is determined.
That's what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
Freedom, real of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it.
It can become...
A habit in our lives?
Technologies of self-knowledge.
Question.
In the planet.
Together with our productive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them.
Are they available?
They're simple.
But it's J.
A lot more generation.
We already know.
And in the future, it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be.
Direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate.
Authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
Who has never been passionate about a TED talk that had the first video?
(Laughter)
Usually, it's the first view.
It was my case.
I can say that it's an absurdly lasting appearance.
The walls are so seductive that the idea is translated.
We had a demand of an idea of childhood.
And they asked for society.
It's a shared area.
Your friends, your colleagues, your family.
In the case of Brazil.
The job of translation?
It's a tool.
Once there are only one.
Five percent of people according to the behavior of prediscity.
Five percent, at least.
It has English influence.
How does it work like that?
The translator thought.
And it's possible to see a door in this field of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
10% of them are Brazilians.
It was translated to 116 languages.
And almost always 6,000 translations made at that moment.
But we're not only translated.
Like also transcribed.
The talks made in elements like these here.
The work of transition is very important, not only to take our TEDx over the world.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment?
I can accompany the combination of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English?
With my case here, there's a Portuguese.
The first one is transcribed.
Leis of the original man.
To later be fertilized for me instead and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
And initially?
"Tech" with its own, "Love Chimpo" in Chica.
The good news of the subjects as "technology" on the TED.
Unfortunately, the "e" we can translate as a entertainment.
And I left.
The people got together.
Nowadays... (Audience)
The talks.
Now, there's an inferiority of subjects that go from an accident or the political, business, entrepreneurship.
Until literature.
We have, for example.
There are talks that evolve the smells.
Another of my passions.
This year, what defines the subject is this auditory accident.
It's that terrible time we have.
Sorry, we're not.
For our biggest life expectancy?
Like also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think it's true that one of the uses I do of my goal.
It's translating and receiving as a bubble.
Talents.
A man comes from the roof.
And it can be.
The TEDx talks, TEDx talks.
The TV series are short educational videos.
"Oh, you need children."
Very small.
I do this not only.
Because translating is a passion, a country is a state word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be a trox, to be a TV.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only that they help me walk, but they're a very anxious person.
Isn't it just a charming?
Thanks to this day, I found myself alone, but half an hour and hours a day, two treasures went by with me and countless translators.
Not only because I had fantastic people, I met here in this event.
I'm a assistant.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
In these actions, like this.
"That's it."
The second dangerous thing is that cold.
I opened the lesson of man in life.
Audience: Oh!
Audience: Yes!
Do you give light to yourself?
And to become something that is very potentially because I don't see any education.
It's fundamental for that.
And I don't have doubt that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged, with good criminals, excluded to our society.
They can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's the work of donation.
Whether it hurts your time?
Whether it's from art to knowledge?
Can you help an object?
Just because your work is willing.
Because I always choose a mine, a mine decision.
I have to do the best way possible.
And try to commit myself.
Do you have the time left?
It's different to equate the works and the rest of our time.
The translation of complex activity that demands not only to know.
The menstrual food, the funds, mainly.
Our language.
And it's called "Fones," that keeps us growing.
It's a perfect translation.
There's always.
A dream of knowledge instead.
The world is research.
A lot of work, a lot of research.
And for us, such a fluent translation to be a black girlfriend?
There's always a degree that I've enjoyed.
And frustrated with facts, what?
The best thing that makes us, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved in almost infinitely.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, they are the majority.
But, despite that, we create the transparency of our translators.
I'm not only in respect to speakers, but in respect to those who talk, OK?
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions.
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers.
It was finally ...
They've been approved by an orchestra language, a coordinator of a bar.
Or as we call it "DC."
In Brazil's case of the Brazilian Portuguese, which is Juncia Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
Do you have the Gayma?
We're Maricene.
Claudia.
That's it.
We have our guys.
And what was my birth?
I liked it.
Together or luck.
And the coffee is me.
A good world ... (Audience) Hi!
This obsession I have with education?
In reality?
I have to hear it.
Not only with Brazil.
What a living in the air?
A deep, political crisis, denied education.
Audience: Good afternoon.
But without it, my exchange is personal.
(Applause)
My father, who, today, had been two years if he was living, got a primary course.
Despite that, he knew how to shake well and make the rooms and mathematics very well.
And the dream of this was to always be able to study the language I've studied.
And to make my children come up.
That's why he lived our neighbor from our girls called "Tairobeas."
He decided to change his four movies at the time, I'll go very fast, the biggest city we live in.
In some places, my father had come from his beginning, his logic, the library, and his cycle.
Knowing that, as a commercial, he, from a small hotel, had a presence store, had a rest of years.
At the moment.
In 1964, there was a great presence for Brazil.
I became this exception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and lost.
"Ah, I'm sorry."
Audience: Yes!
He literally said, without anything, because the semiors don't have the nineests.
(Audience) Yes!
One felt the humiliated feeling of his economic failure, my father decided.
After a couple of degrees.
If changing for Belo Horizons as a cold behind, eating well the liked to go.
In Belo Horizonte?
My mother, who today has a few years old, is my hearing, right?
Besides being an asteroid for Paráito, it's still a hole, a hole.
It's not to know about cooking.
She was a warning conclusion, and she decided to skateboard to sell.
So, for many years in my house.
Pon de queijo was literally winning the stage, reaching this disguise in the best Pan of queijo of Perdalisans.
(Applause)
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father didn't mature his hand.
It's that we're destroyed to study.
And that's how ...
It was done.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with the penalty of the national research for the samples.
In the 48-year-old faix, at 60 years old in Brazil?
Only 32% of people in greater solidarity than me, fundamental.
And this obsessed, this passion, that my father had for education?
Transparentia?
In the worst days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting me.
From standing.
During the seven years of age, at that time, we would take the college entrance exams.
(Laughter) When I got to the country, I got to work, I got to work for a few visits that appeared at home.
You can imagine, and then I'm entering the words.
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get there shaking.
Without knowing?
And he was having a little to know how to be here.
Let's see.
I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than that today, we were able to give our own.
When dreams come better, what do we have?
And here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life of my plan, many are my beloved dreams, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
Parents, I've never put this as a chair to have a newspaper for me.
But for whom I asked all the nights.
To have stories to disappear.
It's a culture that was always a pleasure for me.
And for my daughters.
Coincident who coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, became teachers.
Education is being a group in an accident.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is a creative educator.
Interprets, revolutionary companies, that apply, in the education of light, their own school.
So ...
The only message I can leave here today?
It's that we need to do it.
It's education, an obsession: we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite the limited conditions, even if we develop our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
It has to do exactly.
I'm the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was his simple way.
He inspired you.
Just like today, I was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
Right?
Don't inspire yourself.
To spread ideas.
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
We can.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had her first contact with Braille.
A alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So they taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when they returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the braille.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule.
It's a little girl who allows me to write in Braille.
In the jungle, you can write that the release shows.
I ended up in my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to the roots.
I wrote her that I was learning, and I still gave tips.
And with that, in the first second year's passing.
We found out that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Coyation da Cruz."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we would take one on the Internet and be ready to connect with the engines, and we would have a clock.
But Vick didn't have the Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors.
Right?
And I'll show you the hours and the minutes.
It's funny for you to feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake up and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything and started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock.
And we showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us.
And they encouraged us to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille.
It was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family.
He showed us how important it is to develop his own interests.
And use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help, in the kitchen, and potentially many other people.
This showed us how necessary it was to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple.
They haven't yet been created, and if even us, two students from high school didn't even end.
In the middle, we're on the second year and we're teenagers.
We managed to create something innovative.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
(Music)
(Applause)
Let me ask you a question.
What do you think?
Abult people.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
They don't do it for the manual.
OK, we're all in agreement.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that are commercial.
It's a mountain exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part, with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women.
That they generate their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients.
in apartments, hotels, or even street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
That's what I'm here to talk about.
I'm not going to talk about cases who involve it.
Children?
Or adults that are correct.
Scasses that involve us 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases.
These are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially, and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In addition, sexual child is sexual.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, this inherent volunteer institution and forced constitution.
We're also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations.
The trend is the confuse for the situation against sexual exploration.
But taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
In other words, research has shown that's Portugal.
The phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact, it's phenomena that our identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic, which is the state organism.
Here, in Portugal, there is an information about human traffic issues, and that, relatively, there are in 2016, which are the last available data, indicated that there are Portugal confirmed 118 victims of traffic.
Human.
Almost all of them for natural exploration.
Vitimate for sexual duration.
Only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify a judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in the prostitution.
Like victims.
Very ugly.
Sturated.
That's something that expects someone to save them well.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
I also have all the people, the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economic inequalities.
Desqualities for cultural beings.
We know there's a diversity of constraints.
And influence the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator meeting interviews, I talk to people who do sex work.
What they say is that they will be an option.
It's a pondrated option, after decorating the advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter a terrible activity, but which is highly destined to disagree and is not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
(Laughter) The mind.
Do you think of a person who prostitute themselves?
Think about it.
Okay, and I bet most of you thought of two situations, or in any newspaper.
Or at least in the woman of the bad aspect?
And from Ministry, in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
And it's very likely to be a psychoanalyst and, of course, there's someone exploring.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images.
That they don't reflect with rigor.
The reality.
There's a very big diversity.
Of people who are in sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Proactics.
Of the experiences, not all the people with positive experiences, but not all the people have negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
I say that the studies that are made substance.
Western cities.
They try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century, tell us that...
Please stand up.
Because it will only represent 10% of us.
It's the total of depositing people.
And when we think about women?
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
They're minority, but they're not licensed.
Let's give you the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the person in days.
I'm interested in Lisboa.
And who interviewed 140 sec workers, both in the street context, as in the countryside context, men, women, trans people.
That in all the country and found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does.
It's about the victim of a man or a teacher who forgets what a percentage is.
And men who are.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, in high school.
"What? What?"
Although it may appear.
It's an apparently humanist idea when it's analyzed by negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And it's the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's rained.
To sell sex.
But it's a crime.
The idea is based on it.
Where is this law?
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception.
However, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and so we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But it has been very strong evidences.
Especially the organizations of new phenomena that are on the ground and that work every day.
With people talking about sexual abuse, and they tell me that this law puts in greater risk.
The own drivers put themselves in rich people to know about sex and that increase their sustainability.
Violence.
It's stigma.
And there's a disease.
(Audience) Yes!
Another idea we all have is that this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
They are victims ... Hmm!
Audience: Yes.
It's an idea that, without big explanation, happens to the wind.
The resources of people, and this idea of what clients have is a criminal.
For an idea that I think is ideologically invested, even because research has shown.
And the actions between them.
The workers of their sex and their clients.
What are complex relationships?
And that mostly, they are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea that we call clients is dehuman.
What are the people?
They are deficiency carriers.
People with functional diversity or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right.
There's your sexuality.
It's your pleasure, and many of them can do it.
It's a huge sex profession.
There are even countries.
What has the fungal figure, which is the sexual assistant, what is someone who receives train?
I want to know how to have sexual relationships.
They are people who are teachers' producers.
It's science.
I think this example is.
It's quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
about sexual work relevance.
And now, what has destroyed any argument?
What's in favor?
It's one of the clients' criminalization.
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment, your life, to make it easy.
To your eyes.
These are the economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done you.
It was found on the work conditions.
This can be done.
Without more exploration than in our work activity, why do we continue?
I don't give so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
It's the cause of moral.
And is it specifically moral?
Sexual?
That divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, it has a sexuality considered legitimate.
"Normal."
And natural?
And on the other hand, we have a sexy deafness considered illegitimate.
It's normal.
Anti-natural and that's when it's placed.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base.
The stigmatization.
A essential rejection.
From the description of the sanction, of the devalorization of people who do this activity.
The stigma.
It's a coffee mark of deep sewage.
The stigma that rejects sex employees is very strong in many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
It's at the base of so much discrimination about sex creators.
For example.
When they drive in health institutions.
In justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'll tell you this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if any of you has ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on the woman.
The worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
In other words, the stigma of puta divide women in two types, tied and downloaded, seriously and not seriously, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of the feminine sexual sexual security control, it's a kind of smoking behavior that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior disorder, normally, it's the risk of being the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to disappoint the risk.
You're called puta.
But let's go.
What do I think we can do any one, we can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is the human rights of all and include people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from idiots.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge the stigma.
But I'm here doing this moment.
And to give you a voice.
To hear sex workers.
Dar voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to the oldest silencing throughout time.
The sex employees?
So, for everyone, organized and used 70 but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have creativity.
We don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights.
That's what I think we're talking about.
After all this.
And to finish.
Do you think it makes sense?
And it's natural.
We must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause) I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
That's it.
It's art, it's time to cure art.
It's hard to be a doctor.
And that's the idea that I could give a fundamental stone.
It was a doctor to be.
This relationship is very delicate.
Where I have to develop myself, spiritually, this is the way I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have the father, empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing.
And that allows me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment and for me to act.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the human relationships of our time.
They are all more superficial and rare, so the balance is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
A different time.
Where did we get there?
In our arrogance of...
From "elite Branca," I thought I was going to take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian.
One, two, a half-speaking.
I found myself in a feeling that I wouldn't have since childhood.
Do I relate to someone who needed to know how to do and offer to that person?
That involvement, that love.
This assistance there.
He's polar.
Wow!
And this convention, the request of floor and hours.
Honorane.
All the doctors who go with us and go there.
And Rocky.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
I said, "Yes."
"Simplification," which runs there.
It can be replied here too.
It's the grandmother who doesn't need to go to the Amazon to discover this.
So, the path I had to discover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of medical college.
Have you made a list of objective toys all over the world?
The first goal is.
Very good.
It's going to be OK.
These same students, at the end of the medical curtain.
With the same research?
Just because the association of success is knowledge.
It's crazy.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we got someone who had a poetic brilliant TV?
And we delivered someone technical, who knew a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The concern with old and patient relationships is based on the past.
Nathrés.
It's the chest, in medicine, where the father is, the medicine, what populations.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't affected.
When Adão got married with the apple, the Eva desengastated, and that was to make a stone trip, it's what we do until today, I don't touch the same thing.
So why is the Greece considered, instead, to define me and little to your father in medicine, because for the first time?
There's a method there.
It can be art, healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And, in a way, the development of these people had a logic.
In that song too, it was developed, it was created a pócric isolation.
And even today, it's used in medicine shapes.
For the world, it was done in a 7.5 BC.
It's a good person, OK.
I prepared three words, that is, there are very complex words.
In all the houses I entered, I just talked about the benefits of the diseases.
Exiting all bad volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and sisters.
Of course, what they saw is respecting the life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
It's respecting this judgment and not violating, being the dignity of equation between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today you do a journey?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered by the owner judgment.
And, in this case, I've had a work of participating in a transition that is registered to a John's program.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a individual produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable.
I'd absorb all this knowledge.
So today, a patient has a medical team because he takes care of it.
A class and this class, each one is taking care of a little bit like this.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot, encouraging this and losing the patient's cure.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group class, as a teacher.
And ...
I tricked the patient's processes, the tomography, the resonance, and the microscopy, the other sound.
I'll put my hand in the belly, I'll be at home of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called everything and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
He looked at the taxi driver's finger and noticed what was smoking and saying that he didn't smoke anymore.
The five-year-old hole showed that he had emagressed.
As you're on the loss, it's light and dose, you can dress.
And he's able to take care of his own cocoon, a juice, he can talk a lot, "The time you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy that you have, he can remember something that doesn't teach us, and he said, "If all this didn't convince you?"
Besides, as you're seeing, patients.
He's here to answer the vulnerable area, he's testing you to wear him.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "No verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, because you're wearing the black because you want to do the kiss and you're paying attention to him, leave your care.
This relationship is this magic, it's not just beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, who are appealed, improve the fastest and have a higher highest route.
More and more, it increases the number of functional diseases, our means, the same functions, but we don't know why it appears.
There's no exame operation, there's no administrative interactions, there's no Haluty, there's nothing, the diseases are there.
In other words, what happens if our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already raised the mother and said, "Well.
It's interesting to talk about the same patient's relationship.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a patient is to be passive.
Why are we talking to me?
I don't want you to talk to a group of doctors, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two steps.
Here are the doctors, the doors.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our curve process.
And it's not only to look for healthy life, but also to engage your cure process in the decisions of the cure trace.
To do this?
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where we're talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were lots of storms in my health care.
There was a book, a book of health.
The person had always existed.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's an editor, you had to have content to talk.
Today, with Google, you have a very good information teaching, very important, but in many very bad things.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information is greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
In this way, today, it's usually assigned.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter my curriculum, you'll see who I am.
This gives me a huge chat.
Because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, that I studied, and they know that for nothing, that says bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money or video games or other things like this.
So?
It's fascinating.
The second very important thing is that I didn't believe good things to be delighted.
"Look, medicine changed, now your problems ended."
Surely this nursery.
Differently a laboratory with the scientist will have an immediate discovery without the society to feel.
Don't be maturing this for a while.
The information occurs, nobody is doing anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, it's silly.
Third year.
If there's a paranoid thing, like the industry, there's no interest that you're taking away from it.
It's an advertisement that dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and excuses behind, so this thing in my paranoid is not a president.
And for a long time.
The idea is the solution: discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and information is knowledge.
Take information, take part in your cure, but take care of your doctor.
Second thing, the important thing to be active is to be born in a process of cure nation.
That's it.
To ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know who gets medicine.
There's a right to know the risk of that surgery: "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I work 20 years later."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture of it.
To exist, to exist isn't to get there fighting with everyone, it's not exactly that.
Slowly, to know.
To exist, to composition with time, we'll go.
To make the atendments be different.
The methods want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to be tried for a long time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in the tenderness, she was a mountain, and it was a mother.
And we had a patient there, he had a thought cancer.
It's a moon.
Thank you very much.
And there wasn't any orologist, with us, to bring them to São Paulo, to be treated here in the future of cancer.
It's the worst.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his practice.
It was an index that didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor obviously didn't speak Germany.
There was a translator, the son, the neighbour who spoke very well, because he was very bad.
He was obviously enjoying it.
And I presented a question.
And for me, it would give us a scene of a movie.
The Indius was the doctor.
That's it.
The summer was.
That's it.
That's it.
(Laughter)
When I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
Have you guessed?
There's no language without having a completely different culture than the other.
I gave the soul to that other individual, I had all the interest of taking care of it.
Is this magic?
It's the art of cure.
You don't need to count, much figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking that there are doctors waiting for little, in ambulants, in consultants.
So, it's anonymous.
What's going on?
Both the good fight.
It's curating, understanding.
So?
We, doctors.
We have to try to find.
More unity is our treatment.
It's more guilt.
All patients.
To be active in your pure process.
And that makes me feel a connection.
I want the world to be better and you'll be more well treated than that.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Sounds)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Good morning, guys, I'd like to start with Modervie.
What is the physical attitude of this means?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being drives every day.
It's more or less a decision for two seconds.
There's a restaurant, where?
Dorith is the same as during the decision.
To be president of the talk, talking about decisions, I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions, changed my evolution of making choices.
It's an experiment that was done with this journalist, of richerence.
Doctors of the journal had three lessons of that nature.
The digital nature of 59 dollars.
A representative of the Revistant Empresses the Servium Center of a Digital Master also served in citizens.
The result of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how you are 25.
I really like these experiments.
And the value of the defines of the gods.
For the second group, it was only two options.
Emotion of digital, 50 workers.
And we're talking about how 22 institutors too.
And what's interesting is that for this group of people, most of them chose digital option.
When I talked about these experiments, I thought, "What's the option of the middle of 120,000 dollars in printed evolution?"
No one chose it.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in another?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
Why did I have more advanced and I wouldn't make this decision?
I started to study about this.
You'll be very happy, and I'll study this way of seeing and having a name.
She looked at me and said, "Hey.
And you don't want to go back, it's not equation.
To influence the restaurant in a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
And there's a little interesting way, you can see.
Imagine that you have two options to the idea, and you forget that people choose the obtion T.
You already know the least to see the past.
This is the middle of the finger, which seems to be better, for what I pay, and that's the case of them.
I'm not a business, if I can have two at the same time.
This is impressive because I started to question the king and all this.
And one talks that caused Duthern, made the Internet all over it.
My name is Anaise, he's doing a comparison.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
This farmer seems like an idiot.
The sky struggles and it looks a little bigger than the south of the right side.
Do you believe me?
How do I get back?
Here's the genetic shock, I'm going to have to be happy.
We're going to give birth to our stomach.
But we see it in a different way, because I have a new influence.
There's another improvement that I was fascinated by all I saw.
This is the spheres of the cradle on top.
They are equal to the pieces of chess and lower.
It's the same life that you're going to make the problem, before you review it to all of this.
But I'll show you what it is to see.
Without today affecting the pieces and only avoiding the bottom, we see that they are really good.
When I see this presentation, it's better to understand that it makes a sense to say that it has a return to us.
By the same way, what has returned and influence the stage we see things, what also returns to the city is the guarantee of all decisions.
I work in technology.
I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an education through safety.
She said to me, "It's very option, and I live in a brain to explore it."
You can choose these two options, the three or these two.
They don't have it, say it's beautiful.
We were working, and they said, "There are 500 Brazilian possibilities of choice."
The team I was working was going to be a way to simplify this choice to people.
This way, she decided to have another profession, if the person was in the orchestra, she would add these three options.
The person sees me and sees these three options.
It was, at the same time, helping them for the concept of the journalist of Economists.
I've already experienced that there are people.
They do the drawing of the architecture of decisions, where I work with decisions.
And that made me a lot of lesson.
In the World of Economics, there's even the name of this profession called "Io Ex."
And Researchers or the experience of the eyes are exactly the people.
They are the architecture of decisions, they work with the architecture of the decision, delegating all formed and environments in all decisions.
The first thing that appeared, my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this guy from her, he's the person who was a guru in this group of economies with the capital.
He sent me this door and said, "Look, I found it's not fresh.
I told him, "These your theories, you have to bring the knowledge of the behavior to the digital world, and he was super amazed that he wanted to talk to you about "Joutuca Prislevia," and he'll have a flag.
I really wanted my review to see, and I also talked to the hospital.
I think we have a lot of research to know that we use a lot of cell phones.
Everyone lives crossing the scholarship, the scholarship, looks at him.
The ladies and gentlemen, because they were in favor of the poths.
Would it be that there are some people who have a smartphone?
He picked things in the smartphone for 22 hours, nearby.
It was for you to lose, and you were thinking about it with the deadline.
We found these 35 million decisions that we make.
How many of the users think of digital decisions?
Doctors went to the Egyptian Egyptian Ross, one, and even a digital one.
Or that the digital tool, sometimes, will be one of these two.
I started to ask myself all this.
Is the Rongo's handkerchief come from a person?
Literally, this drawing is me.
Are we going to change?
And we say, "Let's do it."
The six story of my friend will tell me, "Do you want me to know this city?"
How many decisions do we treat and big dealing with power?
Now, the world decides how to make mistakes.
Is it today?
(Applause)
(Laughter) And these are the ultimate dreams.
Speaking in groups, I should talk to you about another in Rio de Janeiro.
It's a wall in Austria, it's 91%, and in the diagram it's equal to the center.
You'll be wondering what the journalist thought was and said, "It's the number of living beings."
(Laughter) (Laughter) It's not strange, but in these cases, it's my name of the fingers and robberies.
So it should be this number to ask me, "Why did you treat 99% of golden pain in origin?"
In Austria, you're already a doctor.
You need to ask to leave.
In Denabarca, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word called defeat.
This word is what you're already.
Nothing to do.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to ask for it.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days.
Here I have two options: one provided the recipes.
And another allows me to receive.
Otherwise, the recipes were dismartened to the offers and they were killed.
Someone decided I wanted to go to Africa and I didn't want to go there and go out.
I asked to get out of the audience's mark and recycle markets.
Uber has a new functionality, a Q, you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the people.
This is the "no" I asked him to leave if I was really in the people and until then.
I didn't have to read to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber mountains, I don't know if you take the work they've been talking about.
And then, another one of Uber once told me a story.
And a lady?
I took a push.
When the car arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage in the car?"
And the price is to choose the cup.
(Laughter) So, little by little, she chose what she was already chosen by her.
Isn't it?
It's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
Are we the Google today to research today with the media of the person?
In 177,000 results.
What is a click agent?
It's 91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Can we choose a place where people eat, it was me, it wasn't Google?
After that, what I do, I'll read a click on the website.
I love Perfect, I see from there what parents don't go to the right page.
I'm going to ask you this.
(Laughter)
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
These little English and English have a name in the Constamental Economy as well as the name: they are the so-called "innights."
It's exactly a little empurring in English, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy and think so much about it.
Don't need to put it on ... (Laughter) It's an ecology.
(Laughter) He has a script.
Is there a theory?
There's a car called "Britteira," there's a book called Dante.
What about it?
The concept of "digitalonante" is what I gave.
It was a simple way for us to understand these impointments in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said,
Now I understood.
I thought there were adults.
(Laughter) But it's not true.
(Laughter) In this appearance, it was my picture, my curtain of object ... (Laughter) It's beautiful.
You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austria and Detina Marca.
Everyone here received an email.
I confirmation of TEDx.
This e-mail had a text.
I've written, "Aless you're seeing, TEDx is a person, you're automatically taking power of all your decisions."
Who's going to eat in your life?
"Shut up," I said.

I asked him to leave this.
How many people were there?

We'll build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware.
Why do we make better decisions?
Thank you.
