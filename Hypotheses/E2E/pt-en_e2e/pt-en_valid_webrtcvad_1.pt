(Music) I want to start with Nelson Mandela in the great heroes of our time.
That's what the true character of a society is revealed by the way I treat their children.
But in Brazil, we are living in paradoxes.
Our children are what we have the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children will be very bad treated for society.
In fact, this requires a reflection, and it requires us to provide changes, which is what I hope to do a little with you today: if we think about the poorest children in Brazil, that is the majority of the criteria of Mandela, we are a terrible character, we treat them with violence, and if they reveal themselves.
We offer her the prison, but even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and daughters, who are here.
The thing isn't good, we committed, maybe, to a small trip about seven capitals that our society is starting against childhood, and we'll get...
The wave of Gabriela, a child from middle class.
The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, at that moment of link, affection with her daughter, receiving, along with her husband, this baby who will be born, and then starts to go to Christmas, and, quickly, the medical industry wants to convince the best for her to be a Cesare.
Remember that, of course, there are cesáreas for each of these markets we're going to be, a highly lighter argument, but that is very convincing, so convincing that the normal birth must be accessed, that the normal part is harmful, dangerous, dangerous, painful, and that generates a green statistics in our country.
We are criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me, the same way happens with a mother's milk, this woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but already left maternity with one of the many pediatrists who can be there.
Working, it's going to say to her age, and you can take a mammal, a little formula in front of you, the case of her, she's hungry, she's hungry, she's safe, she's home, she's alive, she's strong.
The child is crying, the ear is weak, in two months, this child is breastfeeding, and she loses marvels that the maternal milk can offer, and this comes a big part of the industry's house.
The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms:
Experected, surprised, and the maternity industry goes directly with the doctor, doing the doctor, convincing his dinner awards and congresses, and sponsoring the natural birth of theater leiting, serious health problems in the children, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovered now.
And Gabriela grows, her mother will finish the essence, she'll have to go to the church, because the grandmother can't take care of it.
She'll spend six, eight, ten, twelve hours in an institution, she'll get home, her parents' parents are regretted from a stable tongue in bottles, and they'll live little with her daughter, and there's still a job to do at home, at the end of the week they'll pass.
The Gabriel's parents can't cook, there's no time, they don't have money to drop the Brazilian food, which is wonderfully healthy food, for a rich food, in fat food, it's what gives us the intimacy, the ability to be careful about someone, the feeling of taking care of these beautiful Brazilians, and the child loses to live with the most important people in their lives.
They can't.
Because they're annoying, and this leads serious problems, like obesity, diabetes that are exhausted from four months, and even if we want to give food, we can go from a healthy food, because it's not so healthy, because it's in one of the agrotoxes, and we're worldwide consumption of agrotóxes.
Nevertheless, in our urban life, it doesn't allow us to do this, people have fears to let the child go out, they stay at home, they're a wonderful thing, they're a moment of living, family member of laughing, things that are in the memory of us in childhood; we look at the landscape, we're playing, and we're at the person're playing in the person's game, it's, it's a moment, it's an incredible moment, there's a moment of consciousness, they's a moment of consciousness, they're permanently distracted, they're permanently distracted, they're permanently distracted, and they're constantly distracted, and they're constantly distracted.
(Laughter) This is the name, Hipport, even in the moments where the child needs the awareness, that's what we offer to her, in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive distraction, which we confinate our children, and prevents them from the facts of what is most important for us, the creativity and the imagination, and we are pushing it.
And then, in the weekend, of course, she goes to the park, "No, it won't go to the park, the family does the classic program in Brazil for a week, which is "O."
Very well, when it's going to be more massacred by obesity, by consumption of successive, and by brands, inclusion of love, and that instills in it, values like an obsessive consumption consumption consumption consumption, and this advertisement is a covard.
Futility and worse things, and that will disagree in obesity, even in the consumption of alcohol consumption, we know that the beer in Brazil is not totally liberated, and always with the bottom of friendship behind, and, obviously, those who need friendships are deeply affected by the consumption.
Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want her to be competitive, an adult of a lot of success, and her agenda gets full of commitments, to relax from this stress, and they increase a class of meditation. (Laughter)
But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing: Who hasn't meditated in the balance?
Look at the sky, look at the floor, and then it's going to be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, "Merodization, look at the sky."
That uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products, meritization based on machismo, the objectification of girls and women, in the excessive value of appearance, and worse, in the dissociation of sexuality.
From love and affection, this is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects the children's directions and deforms them into a trunk, it passes to be the queen of the family, not a member of the family, it goes to the school, the fault of the school, we have to talk to the teacher.
She earns many presents when she needed, it would be presence.
She realizes that maybe more than her parents don't have authority, a child, sometimes, at two or three years old, she needs people who lead her life, this is generating taste and generating symptoms, we know that the importance of our children and not are fundamental ways of love, we need to give them to their children.
Making them don't have the experience of life, and therefore, they don't develop mechanisms to deal with the frustration, with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver them later, this is the peculiar one.
Introonization and superproduction is also easy: Well, before so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms, the child will be rebelled, shaking, and will eat too much, or staying in the school, doesn't pay attention, it's hyperactive.
We need to do something about this: it's not possible for these children in this way, in the same way we take these poor children and put them in the chair the solution that we're not going to give them the most covered children, not the revision of all these problems, not to think about this context, not the medication, but the mediation.
They go to the doctor, see they're sick, they receive medicine, they go home, buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what doesn't show us here, in fact.
Medicalization of the most rights phenomena, you see that in the United States, 15% of children today are set up a beach, with this competitive and individualistic society, what the factory that is produced is exactly the medicine, right?
The three colors are the market that grows the most for depressive, we're arriving at this point, and the ritaline, the remedy, which is for the disorder of attention and interactivity?
He sold, in 1999, 70,000 boxes, and I'm sure that some of these geniuses, in humanity, had this today, in school, would be exactly this, rotated or non-marketized, and we'd have prevented the child from two million boxes, this is not the epidemic of disease, and it's a massacre against childhood.
So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need solutions, but it's better to change the paths, and problems are very complex, and I don't see it without any end of fishing and factors that highlight each other.
But for the whole problem, complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution.
It's obvious, but I want to propose a simple solution for you, which is what we reflect on this: a solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing.
And, in relation to time, what can we do, when we talk about pecados, we're talking about penitence today, means "dism payment," in almost all the churchs, "When we have more precious for our childhood, our children, which are our sacred, what do we have of more precious today?
Our most important capital is time.
In relation to space, I'd like to propose an exercise to you: 15 seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you, "Confidence, close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place, a healthy city, and if it's not too long, it's possible for our children to grow because there's health and quality of life, it's not a good place to live."
Visualize this place.
(Music) How would he be?
Look at my eyes and tell me if you fit yourself in this statement.
(Laughter) I'm sure the majority of you, yes, this shows us a little the importance of nature among us, nature is deeply associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul.
I talked about the convergence of sustainability, I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment.
Everything that makes good health does good for the rivers, does well for the time to convive the stress reduction, reduces the pollution, with my organic performance, does good for the rivers, does it well for the Earth, does the animals.
Things always retreat themselves in a positive way, creating simple vicious, and I live with nature properly said, with open space, what does it do?
Look how wonderful it is to reduce all the problems of childhood, it's different children who will know each other and learn to deal with them, they promote psychovies, free events of these spaces, with love, affection, and there are many movements in Brazil, doing exactly this, and play in the square places, safety.
Accessive and careful squares, all of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city, and the word occupied practically used for citizen resistance today, means this, occupying public space with joy.
And, mainly, taking part in the governance of cities, the governance of cities is what makes the difference between catastrophes, as in São Paulo happened, where they are seeing here, in a picture of Billings, a source of São Paulo water, 30 or 40 years ago, and today.
For the governance magician, and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they come back, and people demand to the public authorities returned to the public interest, with their sustainability, with equity.
To conclude, the same scientists who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, will live very early, our children will take me full, also say, 97% of scientific consciousness, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing inequality from the social level, and, of course, doing everything we already know, starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre.
Actuating for sustainability, reducing consumption, recycling, changing energy pattern.
And taking children outside, families, already outside, we go to the city, we're going to occupy public spaces with the game, with games, with games, with games, and we learn to take care of others, and we're going to reduce inequality, bring children to nature, and we're going to defend in the future, with participation.
The more I approached him, the more he gets away, if he approached me a thousand steps, he's affected by a thousand steps, so that he serves utopia exactly to make us walk, that she makes us walk outside. (Applause)
(Applause)
In 2007, ...
I came across a great group of young adults with disabilities.
Scluded from the regular school.
And since then?
My biggest challenge?
It was to look at the efficiency of these people who are marked by their disabilities.
So I created the therapeutic coffee project.
What is the group of parents, students and friends searching for a really inclusive society?
(Laughter) To be able to discuss inclusion inside the school.
With parents, with their children.
And with the partner.
People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't.
But I can see many things they can do.
And in this project, they present this to parents.
For the community and for society in general.
People with disability ...
Sometimes they're left aside, stop having friends.
Because they think they're not able.
To have friendships.
To feel like acting with people.
Tell the case of the Igor student, for example, that in the other school he studied.
For four years, he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers.
People didn't make an effort for that too.
So, over four years, he was in the court taking part in all the physical education classes.
And since he loved running, he was running all the time.
I said, "Are you getting to the clean field?"
I looked for knowing the Igor in a global way, I tried to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school.
And what would we do together?
For him to be able ...
They got better learning.
The school?
For Igor, it was a place of despair.
Well, is it that it's a pull?
Today, it's very happy.
He has classes with several teachers.
He has many friends, he says I'm his best friend.
And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on parents' Day.
And I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading.
School can teach autonomy.
The freedom of expression.
And it can teach the student to enjoy.
It's your own learning.
Schools think.
That they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them.
But schools need to overcome these difficulties.
We need to use and believe that these children are capable inside the school.
To do good for them, it's going to do good for other students, for school community.
And for society as a whole.
I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others.
Why did I choose this way?
"I have what I know."
There's what you know and there's what we can learn together.
(Laughter) Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities?
I learned to appreciate my look.
They are living with people, so they can see.
I learned to value my legs, to live in people who don't hear, I learned to use my hearing.
Or those who can't walk.
And I learned to appreciate my ideas with those that often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about.
But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart.
The heart of my students, to create connections and friendship bonds.
And the most important thing for society?
It's learning.
It's an exercise.
From empathy.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening.
(Applause)
I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been able to cook.
When I was little, I loved to see my grandmother, a cook.
I'd cook, work in the kitchen, she'd take account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa, and she did everything with a lot of love and affection.
Those who liked putting their hands in front of her, in fact, was my brother, so much that, until today, she asks me how, when and why I went to the kitchen.
And this is the answer I want to give to you today, because there's something that can change the future of food.
It's the act of cooking.
In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga.
And then something transformed me, transformed my life completely, changed my view of the world, changed my food, and I realized that food had power, let's say, and I also decided to study food philosophies that could use it.
The food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine itself.
So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics," because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think the modernization took from many young people.
which is the void, the care and respect for nature.
So I decided we could...
Changing the way we change.
It builds the food system through food.
And I believe...
One of the colateral effects of modernization is the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life, so I believe it's us.
Trucé is a little bit of life.
Rural for the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature, for example, planting urban gardens.
It's a way that we can connect with nature.
(Audience) Yes!
A few years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook.
I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen.
I understood that we could use it.
food, food, food, as a tool, not only to improve quality of life in health terms, but also to improve.
For a political, economic, social and environmental tool.
And with this, we need to do it.
It's to get it.
Reestructuring the food system.
Changing the food dynamic, the production process, distribution and consumption of food.
So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat, for example, there are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale.
It's quantity and speed, the more it is produced, the more cheap it produces.
The worst is quality.
The biggest cost for the environment and the life cycle of the animal is accelerated artificially and for our health, in terms of speed, the animal cycle is accelerated artificially.
He ...
He begins to grow and produce in a way that his bodies come when they don't get it, and he begins to lose, to decrease dramatically, his quality of life.
In your health and your life time, then ...
I believe that we can and should change this food system, I was the other day passing from the supermarket and realizing that the kilo of Franco was cheaper than tomato's kilo, I said, "Guys, how can this be very complex, right?
This didn't enter my head.
In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the process of production in industrial scale is also a lot - because today Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotóxes in the world.
Each Brazilian consumes, on average, 5 kg of agro toxic per year.
It's an overwhelming amount.
I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so they continue to tolerate this abuse in the use and consumption.
And I wanted to understand why, but the answer is why our current society ...
There are inverted values, why does a person worry about a investment of values?
And not buying a perfume, false, because you think there will be any alergic reaction, because you don't know the procedure, you don't know what kind of chemistry is there.
And don't worry about eating an intoxic vegetal, right?
Why is that?
So, I ...
I wanted to understand and discover that this change of value, and we need to teach people to value organic products, because, for example, when you buy a mass of alphace.
It's a organic officer, you're paying, not only you're investing in many times, you don't know that, behind that alphace, there was someone who cared with all the love, and took this alphace to you, so we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature.
That's why I ...
I think I fell in love with culinary and nutrition.
In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient.
I think it's right?
You must know that we produce a lot of food.
A third of the food we produce is simply dispersed, thrown away.
And we ask ourselves why there are people still passionate about hunger and reason.
It's a politics of distribution, we have to review this.
In terms of consumption?
Also, the way we consume in today's food is scary, my grandmother is paulist, she lives in São Paulo.
If I take it and put it on, seeing those executives or those appreciated people walking on the street, talking about the cell phone, swimming a piece of pizza, for example, because I'm sure it's very scared.
And it's...
So ...
These funds, these quick foods, were made of the same fish, so we can eat together with another activity, or talking about the cell phone, tecling, watching TV, so we need to reveal the way we consume food.
They end up destroying our paladar, they degenerated our nervous system, a mental dependence, a psychological dependency, an altrubicient, and these, mainly, the reassuring remains, they also have many chemical addic addictions, and a level exaggerated from salt or a sugar dependence.
In other words, industrialized products, in excess, are very prejudicial, I don't even call them food, for me, they're food, because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't feed you, it won't feed you.
And who here still makes pipoca of panels, a pack of panels in the microwaves, look?
This question may seem a little inoffensive, not wanting to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot, only if you exchange the panels for the microwaves, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you're consuming it.
I think the chemical consumption that you wouldn't put, I'm sure, absolute bicycle in your panel pipoca, and you're also polluting with the package of microwaves.
It's excessive to produce industrialized products, it's very prejudicial, right?
So, to summarize this question of production of food, I think...
It's a lot this dynamic to feed this food system.
It's not healthy, it's not.
It's not working, and we must change, but how can we change?
The main answer is to go back to the fuel.
To cook ...
It's this name of art, culture, pleasure, kitchen brings independence, brings high, pleasure, health.
self-knowledge brings autonomy, safety, freedom, cooking is the fundamental art of life.
And if we don't cook, someone will cook for us?
I hope it's not an industry, (Laughter) because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes.
So, if you leave the industry feeding you ...
She'll choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, cold battle, hamburg, street dog.
What about a pizza?
(Laughter) So I believe that we don't even need to do more.
"Oh, no, that's it.
Each rice and the feijon broke the rice of each day, that filled our belly and our soul.
I think there are many people who don't have interest, who don't have a price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very workable, very anti-pratic, it's waste of time, but, for example, if you leave a mold at night to day, wake up in the morning.
In 20 minutes, you have a ready party in the pressure panel, or you can simply take a day and make the feijon.
Let's be frozen by the rest of the week, gathering with the fresh rice that you do in 20 or 30 minutes, more the legumes you've already left cut and washed in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and half an hour you'll wait for the pizza to get there.
Experal of Pizza's book.
So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, as we see the act of cooking, everyone can and must cook.
Men, woman.
And elderly, boy, girl, child, adult.
There's no age, no sex, no gender, everyone can cook, everyone must cook.
So, changing education ...
We teach children taking the fair children to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting the children to dedicate a battle, the value.
Simple things in our daily lives, we can build a better future, these children will grow with a holistic vision of the world, they will know where food comes from.
Many people think they come from the Brazilian to the supermarket, so we'll...
They will grow dependent on the food industry because they will know how to cook, they will grow dependent on the industry.
The pharmaceutic, because they'll be much less sick, growing with less food, a healthy food.
I believe we have to change.
Dynamics.
In food, we have to change our eye.
Our value we have with food, we have to value the food more, value the act of eating.
And cooking isn't just talking, please, forced to leave and cooking.
Education.
Isn't it mean?
To understand that the hospital is synonymous of health.
Isn't it?
I think...
To have a quality of life, a healthy lifestyle, a healthy food for us to have less hospitals, this is education.
Education and prevention.
So ...
The future of food ...
It will decide the future of humanity.
To cook.
And choosing good foods?
They are choices we can do.
To change the world better.
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Life is not the one we lived.
But it's the one we remember and how we remember to tell.
It's here in the background.
To talk about the transforming power of stories is to pass through my own story.
Because most of my mother's family are here.
I came here when I was a child, I spent vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties.
My great-grandmother was the first tribute planter.
From the Brazilian mechanism, here in the lands of Butiá.
And then, he got married with my grandmother and, after having my five siblings, who got married with my father, and then had seven children, inside them my mother.
I arrived in this world, casually, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago, it's the stories we tell that make us be who we are, and tell them, we transform ourselves, and who listen to each other.
And it also transforms us, we want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our history before looking at this future.
We need to see.
Those who come back and honor all stories.
My passion for stories started very early, I've always liked to write, to read, to tell.
In high school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened.
This book helped me live the mourning, and I know he helped many people too.
So having told this story to me brings one of the most beautiful things about this.
That it's the power that people can feel welcomed in the history of others, feel in the colore of each one's stories.
So it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because, obviously, someone ...
It will come and sit in the school of this story and feel welcomed.
But one day, I met this whole world here, from TEDx, I met incredible people around the world.
And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, in 15, 30 seconds, about products.
I understood, at the age of 45, that I needed to change, that I needed to expand, and I started to help people tell their stories, because the world of advertising had already been very small for me.
So I started to make one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago, Tiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx.
about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable about bubble, but he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bubbles.
Because that's what he always suffered.
And he wanted to share the story with others, and I left because he had to do with the subject.
Except that I do you.
While we prepared to talk about it, he always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints with the right, about everything they had done with him.
But what's the goal to tell a story, to keep complaining who did that with us?
And otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can assume who they are, as we already said here, without fear.
And he was understanding this, and he changed his tone, and, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage, and he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time he was gay openly.
He talked to a lot of property about bullying, acceptance and family.
And it was beautiful, and I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, of the people I know they know.
Also, having seen that the wheelchair they imagined that Tiago had was nothing more than a great defeat.
And they started to understand him better, and he welcomed himself, and just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story a lot of people.
He welcomes me in his story, "The week went by, he sent me a high saying ...
That many boys have sought him even more in the air.
It's the time that's so expensive of dialog and acceptance.
To tell him that he had felt welcomed in his history, that they wanted to share with them the problems that were happening in his families.
Now imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story.
And this hadn't assumed for people in a way that didn't have any shame.
So, telling stories to me ...
These are micro-revolutions in our lives.
These are many, not only in them, but also in my own of everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we can hear each other.
We transform ourselves.
And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this for seven years.
training many people to be here, in this place.
But if there's no rule, we can give tips about how to start, about how to ask a question to the audience.
It counts something funny, shows the picture of your children, but, in fact, I think this is not the most important.
And for me, if there's no formula, there's a great rule.
You have to come from the heart.
And to talk about heart, you have to have a lot of courage.
And it's not the roof that courage has the heart color.
About that...
I told Ave's story, "Oh, there's a teacher from the University of Ebraica de Jerus beyond, he researches listening."
And we stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDxLassador.
And there was always something that bothered him and me.
And one day, two weeks before all.
From his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this, every time you talk to me, you tell me, "It's all here, it's all here."
And it shows me your head, how much, in fact, you have to leave everything here.
It has to be a heart.
And he changed everything.
And one day, he gave a incredible talk about listening.
about the importance of listening to others, and how was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the most when he was a kid, when he had cancer.
What did he do with?
It was to study about this.
And he taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count.
There are so many addictions of oratory and writing, but who's worried about learning?
How to listen?
Because he tells me and we saw this today that, how much do we hear, really?
We change ourselves.
And we're afraid to transform ourselves, we're afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we're going to change, so we talk about change, but we're going to change.
There's always this fear, and as we always get there and say.
I won't even listen.
For us?
And for others.
And the listening ...
We also see, before that famous word: empathy, we talk so much about empathy.
But we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say.
Something: we don't have time.
Among people.
Because we're worried.
With our lives.
We always have a priority.
So, how can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen?
(Laughter) But this, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx.
(Laughter) And empathy, there's another story, I could tell you so many, because I'll ask you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most varied stories I've heard, all the others.
For example, when she taught me that we need to look at the problem of street residents, for example, that when we say in the street, many of us don't have anything to give.
When they ask us something?
We have "yes."
We have at least one smile.
And he doesn't like anything to give.
So, again, it's the stories we hear and that we tell that make us be who we are, and when we listen to others, we truly transform ourselves.
What if the other?
Listen and tell it too, it becomes... And in the middle of the prepareation, a fight that was the process here for me.
I was out of my trip... (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much, why are you doing this?"
Now, and helping people.
And the answer, for me?
And for everyone, I came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read, I'd like to free many of the people I know.
To give her the key to your lives.
From the fourth of the flaws, the values, the kitchen of uncertainty.
I wanted to free many people I know.
I gave them the faith in life, the faith, in some humans, wanted to free many of the people I know, to say they have the right to change.
The right to not love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.
I wanted to free many people I know.
Freedom of your story, which, although important, is not determining.
Liberating fear.
I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of scarce.
Then they could look at the side and come back to smile, tell and hear.
And you, what stories are you going to tell about your life, what stories do you want you to tell about?
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
The truth is that on Earth, I mean, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, where there are all kinds of stars and stars, they don't pull roles, are belonging to their plural spaces, there is no flag, beautiful, rich or poor, where there are no judgments.
It's only linked to existence.
This is one of the poems I wrote for a while during a very obscure phase that fell over my life, a phase that was denied to me the right to just be.
However, I don't look for acceptance, since the moment I recognized myself, but in respect, and the right for life, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born.
So, why is it that we, here below, so small, can't produce something so simple, that acceptance, empathy, the universe is infinite, and, together, there are millions and millions of stars, but none of them can't produce something so simple and understand that the difference adds?
It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal, so that's why we have privilege and the opportunity to be different, we learn new stories, new narratives.
So I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself today to know something or someone different from you, allow yourself.
AC: Well, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first.
Before starting my gender transition, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be, and in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a paper ball, where I could be the same, where I always questioned God or why I was different.
(Laughter) But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me, "Well, the bathroom turned into a better friend, he was always there after a bubble replete, or when I wanted his place in my head and dance rebeldes, because I only repeated until today.
Or better, why do I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom?
And the answer is simple: the fact that I'm different; from there I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad.
And why, for lack of information?
And when it's about the most difficult universe, I researched on the Internet, but I didn't see people like me, and during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see my friends transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me, I just want to become a traffic, like this, everyone coming, therefore I thought and started the wrong way.
So, I started looking for my true decency, and I started to unleash, for example, it's difficult when you're in the midst of a lot of transformations, and you still have to learn to deal with the non-acceptance of the other, it's as if you enter a blue, stay a time there, and leave a beautiful turning line.
They bother themselves with their transformation, their process of transformation affects people, things that shouldn't happen.
So they ask, "But come here, are you transmitted, our new thing, there's no traffic face, isn't it that this phase will happen, guys, who are the choices that life expectancy of 35 years?"
Is there any crazy person here who wants to live like this?
While men have their life expectancy of 76 years.
Who are aware, chooses and seeing the country that kills trans people all over the world?
I wouldn't choose that.
So, they question this and question about the veracity of this.
For example, the Antra, the National Association of Transvestites, said that we, women transgender in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of murdering and murdering, more than a man, and second, if we compare with violence.
Being trans isn't an option, but in a life condition, there's no magic formula, there's a wheelchair and a force, resistance, expectation for 35 years, there's no way that we could mediate the best panel, but it's not.
I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish about me, after I finally found myself who I was, I was invited to live a trans person, I lived being a model, a magazine for other people, and at the top of my career, after I finally found that novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries.
(Cheers) (Applause) It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it.
But that's how I did, abused, I went from my same name, I said, and many people had to swallow.
And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like "Macher, shown," "You'll never be a woman, die."
What doesn't have a price?
(Applause) (Cheers)
What has no price is this message of mothers, of other trans girls, degrading me.
Because by teaching them more than their own daughter.
The best one, receiving message of other trans mines with brilliant eyes, thank me.
To see me there and see yourself in me.
This has no price.
For example, I'm a small part of what I am, I'm far beyond this, I'm far beyond it, but to understand this, I need to really understand that we're many, we're plural beings, the aggrega, to understand the difference, something that can definitely change the world.
The sky?
I refuse from being isolated.
Who was me, a being next to me?
A blue immensity, freedom without limits.
I and the sky, the yours and me.
Not more looks, I don't ask myself to stop, I've already delivered my corridors.
On the past, there are only scars that mark my soul.
But what about the future?
What does the future promise?
That's what I want: a side, now I'm, now I'm going, I'll fly, I'm very brilliant... (Applause)
(Applause) I'm a volunteer, I've always worked with communication, information technology, and I've spent many years doing this and accompanying children, and even with all my knowledge about communication, many times I couldn't explain what cancer was, what was the treatment, the protocols, the procedures.
And they knew that I had a ovarian studio, that doctors called "Tera toma," a beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly, to take the tumors, you won't take a sixth."
(Laughter) Well, I had been invited, but I saw that in the hospital I could operate, I was already used with doctors, nurses, and I decided to do surgery there.
(Laughter) I took the courage, I had never been interned, given the point, nothing, at the same time I was with cancer children, so I looked down, I was full of tubes and connections.
The belly is all mixed, I called the nurse and asked, "Are she talking about?"
So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's out of visiting."
And then I asked her to handle me.
until I slept.
I cut only after the room, I was with cancer, metástasis, and committed gangs, I said to children, "Don't give Google."
Because, after all, it wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky.
So ...
I went to look for information in a safe place, and I started looking for hospital websites, and the only thing that ...
That was the safe information at that moment that I was going to die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances.
Sometimes it didn't help, it didn't engage, and how can you engage someone, if many times you can't even say the word "c cancer"?
And I was a doll.
And the cricket bothered, scholarshiped, landed, but my friends were in the year to help me, and then, at that moment, I realized.
In fact, the surgery wasn't for me, this information of society to help them in hair.
I wasn't able to see myself a doll, and with that I went to see several other information that I thought weren't the most adequate.
(Laughter) When I entered the hospital, I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I got cancer, children said, "Wow, you'll be a hair to stay like us, I said, "No, now I'm equal to you, I don't get it."
(Laughter) But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking about various things and counting about procedures, when I went to do...
It's to put the catheter, because I did chemotherapy before, the first I took advantage of it, I received a hospital kit.
Here in this kit, there was a sabonete, a toothpaste and a teeth curve, but also a shampoo, a touch.
And a pent.
I didn't have a hair, (Laughter) and that, for me, is information, and I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did, and I sent the children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, and what happened?"
Children started to give me their procedures, so they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through radio, several procedures, until I didn't do it, they taught me.
And we've been playing, but then you think, you'll say, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong remedy, that's why the child doesn't know, she knows the protocol, the name of chemotherapy, all this, sometimes parents try to not talk to protect them, but what will we find?"
That's going to fall on my hair, but when we explained that chemotherapy caused hair fall, because it killed cells that get hurt quickly, but not only the cells of the tumor clicked quickly, as the hair cells also understood, they still said, "Oh, it's working!"
And we started to engage children, and we started to talk a lot about procedures, until one day doctors started to connect to me.
If there's a patient who's going to put an athlete, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs in the end, it's the entrance in the patient, it's in the middle, and in our creative friends, and we decided to put the patient in the middle of the process, but with a very important thing, sometimes, we can't understand that the information is focused in the patient.
(Laughter) So we started to do this, and with these children, they started to understand more about the processes, of these terms, our first material, which was a guide.
This guide is to distribute to children in treatment, unfortunately, we can only do around 2 to 3,000 guides per year.
If there's a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we've been pulling 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil.
What happened: the hospitals started to use, they started to ask, children from New Zealand, Japan, several places, and I said, "But there's Portuguese," but we have translator, and what is very asked in Northeast, because children and parents, many times, are illiterate.
So the doctors ask and risk the pages of the procedures children are going to do with this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient.
And information, sometimes, is not only that technology of information, it's not only that complex, 3D, robotic modernity, sometimes information is a pent.
In a kit, so what do we say, and we prepare?
That if you need information in everything, for example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, caress children earn much more present and pay attention to their hair, but sometimes the child is already doing the treatment, it's without cancer.
Sometimes the child is overwhelmed, with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy, it's taking care of the clowns, or there's something at some point.
(Laughter) And sometimes not only for children, for society in general.
(Laughter) When I was in treatment, you have that society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if we put a careful child, sad, sad child, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money, but what happens with this when you're the patient?
How many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship and, suddenly, I receive parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "Yes, my daughter is giving a lot of problem at home?"
I want to take it to the hospital to see what difficulty is.
OK, the mother wants to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there was a child, an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window, to see, to the father with a good life, and in that time we needed self-esteem.
You only have information that puts you down.
So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society.
(Laughter) We make information with all these people who help, but also with a lot of love.
(Applause) Well, I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others, thank you.
(Applause) In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career.
Every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want the chest, I only don't stop what I don't want."
Unfortunately, it's not easy because it's dependency here in a disease and a disease of the brain, and a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people.
(Applause)
Yes, but...
What if, in fact, if, in fact, the answer is inside us to treat the chemical dependency, and if, in fact, these patients are right?
It's in the search of this that we thought about several things: one of these defenses is in our brain, it's called "falical barrier," it's a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain, and that make sure that they end up being able to enter and act in our brain in other circuits.
We also have another system of protection, which is very important, which is our immune system: our immune system is composed by anti-corps and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, until it can engage and neutralize it.
Then, some years ago, we started to discuss these questions, until the day that some researchers in the United States, studying the people who end up using big drugs, we realized that these two things could help our patients, two defense mechanisms.
They produced anticopse against their own drug, it's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way.
It's enough, it's not needing drugs in the system, it's overcarded.
And from this point on, we started to think how we could use the immune system and the palephalic barrier to help these patients.
(Laughter) And me and my team.
A few years ago, we're researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system.
A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to win again their freedom and control it.
How does this substance work, when the user consumes drugs, this small molecule connects itself to a large molecule and, "pum," it's no longer in the armed barrier, it's false.
And look at this image here how this process is beautiful, once we can immunize them, receive this cocaine marked by radiation, it freely passes and accumulates in the brain of these animals.
There's a very significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, which indicates that this cocaine that was passing stopped passing.
Besides that, we ask ourselves where it was to stop, since it didn't happen, and it's very interesting that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats that received the vaccine, they have a much bigger concentration in the blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides the drugs were arrested in a blood fabric.
So, what our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this therapeutic solution to drugs, to be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for these people who have chemical dependency.
Those who know, in a while with the vaccine, they'll be able to have time.
A time to decide, a time to win new freedom and...
To discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm being ...
"Scotherapist."
It's more than 40 years.
I want to say it ...
Besides.
It's generous.
Besides?
It's a psychologist.
There is a trendy disease.
At the end, everything.
It's a disease, it's not easy.
That Janifelenu, Pierre, go.
And me?
We call it "normal."
It's the normality pathology.
And I have to say that ...
And maybe these ones are one of the encantations?
This TEDx big encounter.
Thank you very much.
Is it here?
"No, the song is sitting."
Pontuated from the beginning.
What's in love?
They are habits, attitudes.
A set of behaviors?
Doctors of social process.
Patogenic and pathological.
In some sense.
In some title.
The war?
Cool, for example.
Is it an example?
The most dead.
What? What?
It's the lunch.
Until where I can understand, there are two foundations.
The most important ones.
The nurse is the situation.
Systendic.
The other is the evolution.
The system.
The situation?
Disrespect the fact that the norm has always existed.
Not always existing.
The norm is a typical disease.
From moments?
What do we live inside a context?
Where predominates ...
Violence?
The lack of listening, the lack of care, the lack of responsibility.
of predominating corruption.
Dishumanity in your word.
Egocentrism.
So, is it normal?
Does this adapt to a sick system?
It's about keeping it.
"I have been."
A worker?
For more than 30 years.
From the International University of Paz.
The only step.
And people think that peace is in the bubble.
What happens is the absence of conflicts, no.
"Dad is good fight!"
The opposite of peace, like the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance.
How many wars, Perei, who came here?
A little of pauses.
To shout down the peace.
But with other weapons.
The weapons of the consciousness of responsibility.
The love is compassible.
So ...
In the same way.
health is not the absence of symptoms.
Sometimes?
The person must be that ...
That they have the ability to present symptoms.
Give more concepts.
Sometimes even...
A conscious, lucid despair.
An indignation?
Just that.
This makes me remember.
From a family disorder.
When is my daughter Isabela?
And today she's 34, and she's a eight-year-old boy.
The mother asked him, "What?"
What's the princess you like the most?
"Are you bored, Cinderella?"
Isn't it beautiful?
She thought, "Wow!
And he answered, "What?
I like all May's written.
And I, too.
I understood.
I respect many people who say more.
(Laughter)
Sometimes, because it has the sensibility to feel in your own skin.
I love contradictions.
That the "normatic" don't sit.
People who sought me with panic disease, for example, all of them.
They were accessible people to not say excessive.
That they captured had open doors of perception.
A fear that isn't just your fear?
Is it the fear of the family system?
Is it a method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction?
It's the fear of animals.
I feel disimated.
Of forests.
And these people woke up being desertified.
I respect a lot.
Denominated people.
Of psychotics and neuroactics.
Not everyone has competence to enlighten him.
That's why, in Africa, people who are considered crazy.
They are also considered healthy.
Because they are like a paradise that captures.
The contradictions ...
Culturals.
Systemic.
And sometimes they don't fail.
And how did I say it?
Stop!
The difference between them.
A santo and a mad person?
It's that Santo knows.
Nothing where the other doesn't know.
He doesn't speak.
Maybe these people, at least in a great measure we call...
I don't know what to do.
Psychotics are saints, failures.
I respect the neurons, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consensus, a dream.
The problem is in the atmosphere, it's the people who don't care.
It's dehumanity.
So, I think of a occasion that I come from a seminary here, the Porto Alegre.
And the taxist, when I knew I was a psychotherapist, said to me.
"Doctor, I have a problem in my house."
My son is good.
It's kind.
He gets up to a older person sitting down.
He doesn't sing.
He's stupid.
It's target of bullying.
People hated, ridiculated my son, "What do I do with my son, he's good?"
Do you understand that?
"What do I want to say?"
It became a lunch.
So ...
I must say that it's all the people I do.
respect and admire are all unpleasant.
Fortunately, how?
This fabulous team that organized this encounter (Applause) and nothing against the correctness.
(Laughter) At that moment, you have to suffer from a desert.
So ...
You talked about the nurse, of the machismo.
Racism, homophobia.
From diverse?
Exclusions.
It's a lady.
Could we say, "No, it's environmental?"
The nurse gives.
Another specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything about almost nothing, (Laughter) and that storm catches fire, and each one is looking at the minimum, doesn't realize, their existence doesn't make sense.
We are in an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent.
But it's not about it.
Doing the police of the generalist?
But it's not the functions of computers.
Maybe?
There's a concept.
In this education that has also been here.
Pontade.
How do I feel a possibility of solution?
That I have called vocation.
It's the deepest voice.
From the desire it brought us.
An incarnation.
It's what's us in a stage like this.
It's because we're wrong with a promise that we're saying.
We see it here.
Just for Pik Nik.
We came to tell us a story.
Just you can happen.
If you didn't count, she would get stuck.
So ...
The foundation of the norm?
"Yes."
The situation.
It's a car.
It's very important.
It's the evolution, it's also been said today.
It's the question we need to do.
What differentiates?
The human species of other species.
What differentiates us?
Jim.
A bird of a snake, of a coco?
I ask a friend, "Wow, give a space."
A alternative Nobel Prize, economy?
From developing country, Mãe Fred Max, Life.
Shirlene?
When I met my partner, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know who the human being was disturbing.
From other species.
Intelligence, no, language, no, it's culture, no.
It's humor, no.
And one day, talking to your father, that world, respected.
Your father says, "It won't be stupid, my end."
Audience: Oh!
(Laughter) She differentiated itself, for example, of imbeciality, who acced a little light, and he said that the first stupid estup has become a science that we need to study.
It's absolutely...
Denoa, I like to remember the slower.
And he used to say that you need to be a creator of God, a great brother.
The hypotalamic idiot, to be a good animal, of the vacation to the corte that will be good?
The question ...
It's stupid, because it reversed with rationality.
A person can be highly stupid, and it's highly...
It's rational.
To have diplomas and universities.
Coolified.
To do as a person talking about development.
With graphs, tablets...
Suffisticated?
Like a person sitting in the tree's branch and closing.
So ...
"Nice," she also said.
That for him only had ...
Two infinite things.
The universe?
This human stupidity.
And he grew up: Einstein, with relation to the universe, I still have my doubts.
But I need to say that I discourse.
I don't know how to sponsor Diainist and Max nephew.
And considering what?
North Mozen are pointing not to the characteristic of the species itself.
Human beings ...
It's not your nature.
The stupidity, on the contrary, we were born to be, to flow.
It's going to be said.
So ...
I prefer to think.
A confuse.
That it was 2.600 years old, said.
What differentiates our species of other species is inacabation, it's in complete.
We are not born humans.
We do ourselves humans.
A torture isn't born, it's tired, you've seen it, and it's going to the sea."
We don't...
Are we inacabados?
That's why saying confuse, human beings need education.
Have you heard of it?
School for tartarugas or for...
It's so pleasant.
The education is the perfection, we are the teachers, and it's not just about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems that it's just developing a rational test.
It's about following.
Keeping the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist.
Emotional intelligence, the unionic intelligence of dreams, learning to read the book at night.
But it's also necessary.
To develop a alphabetization?
Concence?
To develop consciousness.
Where?
Jocus, values of a ethics with heart.
The own confusion.
He summarized like this.
Your long existence.
At the age of 15, I oriented my heart to learn.
At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor.
The 40s.
Don't suffer from "perplexity."
At 50?
I knew what the fears of the sky were.
"Are you sure?"
I listened to the elderly.
At 70?
I could follow my own heart indications.
Because what I wanted no longer that day, borders.
It's justice.
Is the same as the terapeutas of Alexandria?
He told us, "You exchange clothes for 2,000 years."
And five minutes, take a whole existence.
It was exchange.
It's about how it works.
And this is the task.
In this sense?
The nurse ...
It refers to an evolutionary stagnation.
They are people who don't invest.
In the most properly human potential, that's why I like to trust, that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be the human being.
Now, in the opposite case, the question was: Is it 21st century?
Is it the human being?
It's not less than this against this game.
In the future.
From the new ones?
Geractions.
So ...
The norm is terrible, because it's not insidious, it's in the silences, people don't realize it.
It's not easy for you to become a human being.
Give didn't understand human evolution, he was a naturalist, he understood the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being ...
As Tiaxatan said, it's space.
Where nature itself can learn to know each other, to know each other, to smile, to be seen.
Has anyone asked for IT?
Think about God.
And the IT.
I said, "Thank you."
Maybe there's a way.
To talk about a sterile of the big wine.
It's fluorescent.
With human beings?
What potentially?
We are.
So ...
"I want ...
Still talking about a story that we listen to doesn't happen.
For more than 30 years, the little guy learned to know this story.
It was once.
A forest.
Incredible.
And all the bugs run away, all of them.
"Don't let us flow."
that would take a source, a water drop, and throw it in the fire.
And I'd go back resiliently, another drop.
I'd play in the middle of the fire, and I'd come back with patience.
It's a bit like this.
It's called "Madinhas."
I'd throw it in the middle, "A tattoo, João, seeing that, said, "Hey, see, flow?"
Do you think that with these ridiculous?
Gotinhas, are you going to pay this infernal fire?
I said, "I know it's not."
An anecdote to everything.
Now, I'm doing this.
My part.
We're all very tired of revolutionary.
People who want to change the world of society.
Sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way.
Because hundreds become transformed.
It's not our task to change the other, nor the world.
Each one of us is a public square pedacy.
And the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order, a little...
What about love?
In this pedacy of the world, that the big world confies each one of us.
What if we don't do this?
Where can we be transforming facilitators?
For these revolutions, I want to tell you.
And they failed and continued failing.
I like to talk about conspiration.
Do you want to breathe consent?
Can I, with others?
Comundo and consistent.
I recommend a book: "The Korean conspiration of Marily Fex."
These spontaneous, institutional movements, from a gigantic narrative.
"Beja flower," there's no ideology, there's no flag, he's not cutting anyone, he's not pushing anyone, he's part of it.
This is what we can do.
We can stand up.
We can do our part, by the way.
From the morning, I'm seeing "Beja Flores," who came.
Each one talking about their water drop.
And all of you who are necessary, everyone.
At some point, you'll be here, in what you'll be in this stage, but in the stage.
It's your life story.
Tell your story.
And taking ...
Your ego had water, because it's always.
Can we turn a candle?
Instead of just complaining.
The darkness.
So, I want ...
To conclude saying that it's time to rethink.
It's also time to not think.
Meditation.
Because when our mind was empty, our transbord rate.
Is it time?
In renovation.
