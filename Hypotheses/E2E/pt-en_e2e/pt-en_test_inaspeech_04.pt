Have you ever thought about it?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should I have my role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary?
It's a hug for everyone.
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009.
When I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations.
"And the vestuary?"
For wheelchairs.
So I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
When they lost a lot of time, they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist.
That was it.
To make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it.
A cause with high-cost, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of the pieces.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface.
Obviously, I didn't put my back on my back because I didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena.
A blouse that had openings in the shoulders.
with pressure button.
To facilitate, at the time, to pass the head.
That's it.
For people who are quadriplegics, the ideal.
It's thinking of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics, that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a website.
In ergonomic goods, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
She says it's visually impaired.
I did a dress that she could use in many ways, under top, under the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information.
Like size and color of the piece.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
It's to think about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
For them, they don't need to find the ideal clothes.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news?
It's that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products.
Like colorful wheelchairs.
Are they ready and stuck?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition?
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
What are the big companies?
Famous and conceived brands that realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections, like Latin American.
She was already in her second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But what about the future?
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it will be going through an adult.
My community started to work with a record.
I was designing people, "How?
Collecting the origin, knowing how to separate one's trash ... So I tried to talk to the child and it was winning the parents' awareness.
The parents who were protecting me, delivering me to children, people recognize me in the community.
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to a school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community?
Do we have a seed harvest when we go to the forest?
It's working with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
There, I met a plant called her name of Ingar, it's a light plant that we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers the ground.
And all the plants I had.
How much below it, we have a good result, in our communities?
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met.
That all plants ...
It was used every one in your place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
So, you have to imitate the forest, why?
In the arm.
I had a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them, various: there I have the guilt, graviolous, Andyroba, Copaiba, Maru, Guaraná.
And everything, there, doesn't give up.
There, we eat.
There, everything was natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
My mother breaks.
And the fruit on the side?
Without our comparison, in our community, we work there, everything with organism.
You eat everything natural, don't have toxins in our communities, OK?
(Laughter)
Is it to compare the human being?
Like an animal.
The child compared it and said, "You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children."
So, I compare the child like this, then he talks to talk to the animal quote, (Laughter) "Daddy, stayed coming to this attention, and to deal with your human being?"
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection, the greatest care for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the eye, "My father says this.
The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person.
That I observed my house.
I kept observing my house and ...
I saw my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So, I saw that all this with my work, who was doing with children, who was the future.
It's OK, and today we have it?
With work inside, with the long run of the human being.
"The skyloning of the other hand?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand children: for those who don't know what's far from the human being, it's the Amazon tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And are we repowering the river that before?
I had a dam.
In front of you.
It's like this a little of our community.
And ...
This dam didn't disappear.
It ended up with the river.
And today we have the "repovuando Vio."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're achieving.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
So I'm going to pass to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
It's kind.
Respire a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ...
It's always talking to people educating children.
And ...
What's going on with other people?
And I have a message to leave a very small phrase here.
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come and get closer to us.
Are we talking about it and competing people?
I'm very happy.
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Absolutely, and thank you very much, guys.
I'm gay.
I got married with a name, I had two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
My family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
I wanted to create that family.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that's it.
It puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you are here, as we feel.
It's like a fear that loses our child.
And we had two options, we could.
It founded us, cried, or...
To resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find it.
For them, we can make a transplant of the metro, which is what it needs to be cured.
That's it!
It was very incredible because all the most schools, and all the most friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all the place, raising people, playing medules, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
That when a child gives you leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns.
It doesn't matter.
Moreover, there's no relevance, it really matters, and we learned to be this lesson, and it spreads to our friends, to the most of the school, to society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement found a donor.
It was that people saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
(Laughter) It's not a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be in the family, or a living father?
Or a more divorced warrior?
The important thing is that I love the family, this union, that gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that the other thing happened to us.
With this disease, for the world, "What?"
Neither blood, nor medule, anxiety.
They were able to manufacture them.
Our manufacture.
The blood is blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human, so that man also raised that awareness.
We have this ability.
Dedoing blood for those who need it, and knowing is not just that.
For someone who has a house in the blood, blood is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all things are necessary.
To give medule to the ocean, to disaster as the owner of medule, to the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one.
about 100,000 people, so if you...
Or to save in life, it's as if the mega seeds.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get a bit of the stars.
Ah, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to be able to save in my life, and that's what is the message?
Or so credit?
It happens to all of us, I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for this union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in LECO.
It's good for you.
It's enough for you.
This is deafness.
No, that's it.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
I'm serious.
It was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I'm an engineer.
I studied at Damasco's university.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not like that, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Warabi, I'm a little crazy.
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
That's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today.
I'm going to talk about it.
What bothers me the most.
"Broken seat."
Who exists about the Slam?
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do like this.
A war chest.
In other words, it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was twenty years old.
Three million people.
And it keeps.
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three fingers of clothes.
Have a writer of Engineering.
Two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamasco.
I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world.
Great!
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day.
It started the war.
March 15.
It's 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities.
From the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer one in Syria.
I had a job, a winner.
It's 25.
Pombas.
Hello.
What a good thing!
In five years of war.
My country is this.
Strói.
Guys, those who know me were forced to carry or fit.
From your children.
They found their wives.
Very and mutilated by a bomb.
His relatives, his mirror.
And they didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if it was going back home.
When I left to work, I went to see my family again.
Or not.
Today.
Millions of Syrian will drink everything.
They were dead or they were fleeing in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, noise and relatives, our life will be back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still lives there.
I don't know if I'm going to hear them again.
To protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
After ten months.
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So?
I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade.
And they wish São Paulo.
It was the best age.
To go to Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
And you, Apinas.
A week to leave behind.
I was 40 years old in my life.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like this: today, I have a Brazilian daughter.
The sister.
Nine months.
In Brazil.
I did a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well.
The food that my great-grandmothers said was to take advantage of the kitchen.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created "Dagina no Facebook" or "Talada comida Syria," that's why now.
Everything has paper cane, but the number is there that gives me Syria.
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world ...
I was closed.
For us.
Etress, who, on the end of the war and of terrorists attacks.
Many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow here.
Or a journalist says, "I?"
Then, what happened in France?
Now, and I don't want to talk, talk.
Or contact?
Like OMAPSOI.
A human being.
Let's think!
"I love blood."
It's allowed to kill religion's name.
But exactly ...
Oops!
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also, Branuse.
Or Syrian.
Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of Islam.
A basis religion.
Or Alcurão?
I'm not a book.
Sagrado says that kills a person.
While she had killed another, dared corruption, a land, and how all men killed, all men, and who read their lives, will be like the darkness of your mother, dressed, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil.
He showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
Children of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When do you see a woman using Ri Jabi?
That silence that I covered my hair, like my wife, was my wife.
They ask questions, "How?"
Why do you use excellence?
With this heat.
Do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline desirai Jabi.
Today, they lift other rules.
Men and women can't touch themselves.
To embrace.
Awesome!
Except you of wedding.
Some people wish me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Keep it, it's the operation.
Beijanzó, Tao island, those rules, more each person wants to eat, or not.
The debt is also broken, some things to be.
The same way they have believed that they don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane and in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I drink alcohol.
Oh, it's PCSO.
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because those things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, even though I didn't know Mozla ... later.
That agency is explained to people always.
Understand?
It's respect.
Or "Teacher, Mohammed Dez."
We must respect all religions.
That all people have the same value.
Why should we have it?
Believe me.
With everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians.
Hi, Lanta Béndez.
That we have to help the people they need.
Every year we have Alsaka and we give it.
Two, five, four hundred.
From all our money to people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims, crystals or Jews.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure.
It was like to understand that it's a basic religion.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil.
And that the world knows the best Islam.
To end.
With "O-brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
These are your children.
"Wow, power, grow."
Together, based.
Oh, that's the molecule!
In the small stories of life.
They come to recite my rhythms.
In the Sun of the Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always willing to not give up the love of who.
I hope, always, it reaches.
Who always believes in their reach?
I don't even believe it, so I lose hope.
But in the daily lap, I know who they suffer.
"Let's do food," "My salary ends," "What's this race?"
Studying a girl was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot of hands.
Cozinheiros?
Fascinera.
What didn't hire me in the mall?
I don't understand this, if I had so much to pay a secret course, but I still entered the office.
Opa, sorry, I had an event among the movies.
It's already cleaning and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I'm here in the same situation.
The EME is to be the domestic, if it were for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, give me an opportunity.
And the lunch said to me.
You follow this corridor.
It goes straight, turns the left, enters the little corner that the vastor is suspicious, it's welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry.
Today I'm here to talk about Facebook, the page that I created in Facebook appeared in July 2016 - this year, she's still not completed four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at home, I was at home of vacation.
due to everyday running, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember all I achieved, there were also some memories of when I was a maid.
And how do I use Facebook, daily?
I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Menina, you can't do Facebook, it's tomorrow, my new day.
And then I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
Then I warned the guys, "Look, guys.
She came to me in the memory, some reports, "I'll start."
To bet this on Facebook, and use the hashtag and domestic employee, so that, in this case, other people have already gone through this too, compatible, and then you can stay following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For my surprise.
In less than 24 hours, this became very rare.
And then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as domestic in the city of Santos, in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook.
And my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I did.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
There was the bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
And this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionate.
This first story on the Internet became very rare.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last history, and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories.
I took six Londons, TV Dábio aleman, and several years.
What I was surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot.
When I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose themselves, and I started talking about these stories because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
The domestics are more valued, they earn.
For hours, for hour, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces.
It's a job announcement that I called "abusive announces," for example, an announcement I read.
It was for worker and work for a second.
"Thank you."
From 8 am.
At 18.
Giving 380 Brazilian reais per day, week, much less, a month.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and I started to fly, and this became a daily practice, so what I did was arrive at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of all the books I wanted, books, even today, which are very expensive, and my domestic, spending for these conditions, not being able to use the bathroom, and suffering all the books I always did.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting down deliciating myself with those books, and for my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, and I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher in history since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
To help the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and, thanks to some teachers and many class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make tests, it's still not over.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, at the time, said, "Wow, it's very heavy, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
(Laughter) Why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this one?
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry, because I was going to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I also work in Brazil.
I would also pass because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with photo and good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me at least a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, and that's it, and then you are.
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are luxury apartments today.
What domestic slaves were in the past, and it's the past not having a distance, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today: modern senzala.
It's almost the case of employee.
She came running, and I was nervous, because I was waiting for her to get there, if this fair is full of payment, and when I get there, I've already entered the car, the noise of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came," it's the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I created it since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered, I was there, I only wanted to see her married, just that, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage.
Because Christmas and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala is the little box of the employee, and then the only solution I had was to take part in my work and go back home, the worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I'm white.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, you won 1800 Brazilian reais a month, you'll never win this value in another place."
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service.
And that's what's happening, no, your bathroom can use, not because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I was there, in the service area, appealed to what I brought the little pot, because the modern senzala.
It's the kitchen of the employee, "Today I'm here."
I would find statistics for some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause)
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and raft.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic illnesses.
"What should be here on my side?"
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke in this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one has this idea of talking about humanizing relationships, we will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this job of domestic people is in this country, so I'm here in the statistics, "I'm not doing it, I'm talking to six million women and women."
Sound of things affecting our lives.
I'm here today to talk.
about silence.
which is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
At the same time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Leave your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Because I'm dying of fear.
If you become a photographer in my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself.
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th, the conceptive energy of my eyes.
She was in the stage, everything was very inflamed.
Have you ever started?
I felt a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's follow.
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Give the pair.
It opens the word.
I have your eyes.
It's safe, with equipment.
Spoint the inflammation points.
The first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level.
And I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door to the state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years in Militan, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside it.
This feeling, this moment of presence.
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have credits, there's no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It's in Cuba.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know who lived a lot of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
I was there.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
To determine my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
Just he stood up.
Several of you.
Think about it.
"No, I need it."
Others justified their importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
Wow!
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You connect.
Come this space.
It's not to get rid of you, it's to slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor ... (Laughter) Put your cell phones on the floor.
(Laughter) Put your scholarships on the floor.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed.
You are not connected.
You took close to you, the tool.
Sternal collection.
Who connects themselves is the human being.
"And now?"
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
To the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Look at her face."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss.
AC: He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
Audience: Yes.
Listen ... (Expiration) close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, let your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
Isn't it scary?
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of me.
Until this moment, with much more fear than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life stories.
Look at them closed.
Come space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember this one.
From the approximate dimensions to the salt.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system.
We wake up, a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system.
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took fingers to the Chicago Aza.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a connected vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it!
What does the area take care of?
Open your eyes.
Strange.
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality is new, as it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
Then you realize it.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence?
And a state of presence that decorates from it.
It can become.
A habit in our lives.
These are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
On the planet, along with our productive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate.
Authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
That's why I had the first video.
I had a demand of a legion of "Fanse Idete."
What did they ask for society?
Books, colleagues, their family.
Once there are only one.
At least, it has an influence in the same time.
How is it like that?
The translator thinks.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Currently.
10% of them are Brazilians.
16 and young people.
And almost always 6,000 feet translations.
These fears and events like these here.
But how can I allow people with hearing impairment?
The first one is transcribed.
I read from London in general.
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially?
In topics such as "technology," "Entrortinment," which is the "e" we can translate as "diversion."
And you leave.
Paulo was referred to it.
The ones that come from the accident or the political, business, entrepreneurship.
Let's talk about the forms of science.
The theme is this inventive event.
It's that terrible time we have.
On the other hand, the reduction.
I said, "Daddy, I'm 20 years old."
It's true that it's about getting into account a bubble.
Talents in the roof environment.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do this day and translate it alone.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here at this event.
But why do I think I have precious people?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
In initiatives like this.
And to become here.
That it's potentially because I don't have a doubt and education.
And they also have a tube: "What do you do?"
Can they insert themselves?
And when is the fish and the volunteer work?
Because I always choose a mine, a mine decision.
And try to commit myself.
To donate the time that opens.
It's different from the air.
And it's called "Fongs," that calls this child.
It's a perfect translation.
There's always.
A dream of knowledge at the beginning.
A lot of research.
Many jobs, many research hours.
For us, a translation like this, fluid, pleasant, too.
The best thing that makes us, he can always do better.
Because the text can be better.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
Sounds and transcessions.
Or, as we call it, "Yes."
I want to judge Portuguese, Portuguese, because it's very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
Very well.
I have to hear it.
What a living on the air?
A deep political crisis, isn't it?
My father, who today was being two years old, got hurt for primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well, and his dream was always power.
And making some kids overcome, that's why the one who lived in our neighbor's building called Tairobeiras.
And, on the contrary, my father had sold his beginning his logic, his feet, and his seat.
If you know, as a commercial, he had a small hotel in a presence store, he was investing in it.
In 1964.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in the cells.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his father's name, and my father decided.
My mother, who today has a few years old, is my help, right?
It was a wisdom of cooking.
Sclusion of training.
She decided to do tickets to sell.
Ponte queijo was interally internal.
So, even though we don't have to eat many times, we don't have to dress from a NGO.
It's that we're destroyed to study.
That's how it works.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it's already condemned to the penalty of national research for anxieties, homicides.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared.
The vocalists think about each episode, they choose a bubble for them, and for anyone they need to appear at home.
Today, thinking that this should be the greatest standardized in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get hurt.
Without knowing, he was training.
Even better conditions than those we have, right?
And here I say, for me, the greatest passion in my life, in my greatest opinion, are my beloved children, Daniel, who are Nietzs.
A adventure was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident, coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, became teachers, education is to be a question at some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the main educator, also fantastic, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies.
So that's it.
The only message I can leave here today is that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion with initiatives is TEDx?
And I said, "Wow!
I'm doing that TEDx, just like my father, was such a simple management in the United States.
Don't inspire yourself.
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had her first contact with Braille.
A alphabet where you can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how the letters worked, the numbers, the symbols.
So he taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when I returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I stopped buying a rule.
It's a little machine that allows us to describe in Braille.
In the jungle, you write that you show the release.
I ended up in my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to the roots.
While I wrote her that I was learning, I gave tips.
And with that, in the first second year's passing.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Cross School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet, we'd be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But saw that there was no Internet, we decided to create our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to create a clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time, it didn't work, the engines only shake and didn't happen, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock.
And we showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others, from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help inclusion, and potentially many other people.
And this has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the pines, and let the message that many things seem very simple: we haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't ended up in high school, we are teenagers, we managed to create something innovative.
There's still a lot to be done to help you.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Please raise your hand.
Thank you.
OK, we're all in agreement: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
(Laughter) Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
In other words, the only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that are not commercial.
It's a monetary exchange, that is, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces, receive their clients in apartments, in hotels, or even street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
That's what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases who involve it.
Children?
Or adults that are correct.
The cases that involve us 16 years or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggressions of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's direct for volunteer institution and forced institution.
I'm also not going to talk about sex traffic situations.
The tendency is to confuse prostitution against sexual exploration.
In other words, taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
But research has shown that's Portugal.
The phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is little expressive, in fact, they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traits.
Human.
Almost all of them for free exploration, victims for sexual duration.
It's only three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify an judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
Because there's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
But often people take all the people who are in prostitution.
Like victims.
Very ugly.
Sturated.
And there's something that expects someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of strangements that influence the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator interacts, conversations, with the people who do sexual work, what they tell me is that they were an option.
It's a pondrated option, after equating the advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who posts.
Think about it.
I bet most of you thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely to the lack of appearance and, of course, has someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Bratics.
Of experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not all people have negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made fuel.
And the Western cities.
They try to estimate the number of people who are in this century.
Plete Saint-Drois.
What will it represent only 20% of us?
It's total of people depositing.
And when we think about a woman?
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
That is, they are less.
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
I'm going to give you the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the third-year-old teacher at the University of Lisboa and who interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of men, women, trans, and in all the country, and found 10.
And now, 7.8% of trans women, and there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
In sexual work.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's forbidden to sell sex, but it's incredible.
It's to buy access, the idea that's at the base of this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, they're victims of an oppressor or the client, and so we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other countries, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-violental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with the people who are already sex, and that indicate that this law puts the safety of violence.
In other words, to the stigma and to the disease.
(Applause)
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are.
They are victims ... Hmm!
It's an idea that, without a big study in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea that the client has a criminality.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between us.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of criminalizing clients is dehumana.
Because they are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexual sexual insecurity, and now that it destroys any argument that tries that this example is quite clear about sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and its pleasure, and many of them are able to make clients run.
So, if people can do this as an option?
If people think that for them, it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Thank you.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
It was found on the work conditions.
If this can be done.
Without more exploration than in the workplace, why do we continue?
To condemn so strongly the people who do sex work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
What about moral?
And specifically moral?
Sexual, which divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, he had a security and considered legitimate.
"Normal."
It's natural.
And on the other hand, we have a security and it's considered illegitimate.
It's normal, anti-natural, and that's where the process begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction, of devalization of people who do this activity, the stigma is a conference of deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects sex employees is strongly put in many consequences: stigma, humanize, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination on sex creators, like, for example.
(Laughter) When they drive in institutions in the field of action, justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
In other words, the stigma of puta divide women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of the feminine sexual sexual security control, it's a kind of smoking behavior that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior disorder, normally, it's the risk of smelling the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
But let's go.
Why do we think we can do any of us so that they don't continue to disrespect sex workers?
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And I was also there.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's about challenging.
I'm here doing this moment and giving you a voice, listening to sex workers, giving voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to see the silencing throughout the time, the sex workers, so for everyone, organized by the 70s, but precisely because of stigma, their voice doesn't have creativity, they are not heard, we don't need rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
(Audience) Yes!
After all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it's useful?
What is natural?
We must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But having a good news too, we can cure it: art, pink, art, cure it, be a doctor, it's surrounded by a fundamental piece.
In the medium relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and so that I can add the best treatment.
This balance is very delicate, and human relationships for us are all more superficial and rare, so this balance is suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips that I followed a lot of doctors, they were also there in several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white avoidance, I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian said goodbye.
That involvement there, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and offer to that person all the doctors who go with us from there.
So the path I'd like to discover is that, at the beginning of the medical college, it's good because I don't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover, the first goals are, it's good because it doesn't need to go to the middle of the area, that we bring to São Paulo, to another practice of air, which has a study that shows.
Altruism.
"You're fine."
These same students, at the end of the medical class, right?
With the same research?
The topic of success is knowledge.
It's safe.
Some time we made a mistake, that we took someone who had a brilliant, poetic stadium.
And we delivered someone technical, who knew a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The concern with old and patient relationships is based on the past.
In Greece, which is the fish in medicine, where it's the father, in medicine, which is pop, it doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before, the airplane is what we do until today, it doesn't touch the same thing, so it doesn't mean that medicine wasn't done before.
It can be an art of healing, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated, and in a way that the development of these people had a logic.
In that song, it was also developed, it was created in a packaging park, that even today is used in medicine formature for the world.
It was done in a certain corner of Christ, I'm in a school.
You're talking about the same complex way, and you've said three words.
In all the houses that entered, I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of children and of the brains.
Of course, what they saw is respecting the life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respected this judgment and didn't hear it, it would be the tiger of returning between men in all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already in that time, if you worry about this, and still today you do the surgery?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered by a man's judgment.
And, in this case, I took a work of participating in a transition that is registered to the John's prolongation.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a individual for the science and science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all knowledge?
So today, a patient has a lot of doctors who take care of it, and this class, each one is taking care of a little piece, with this, we'll specialize ourselves a lot, and we'll lose the cure of the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class, in college, in a small group, as a teacher.
And ...
I tricked with these ladies, patients, Tomography, resonance, and microscopy, and ultrason.
I put my hand in their belly, I wasn't in faces of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called everyone and said, "Let's see the barrier that's fine."
He looked at Nietzsche de Tapá as a patient's finger and noticed that he was smoking in front of us and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth, and he showed that he had emagressed.
If our smartphones are crazy, if you can see them, you're able to take care of your own clothes, a South, you can say a lot, "Oh, the time you're wearing a patient, you have a moment of intimacy, you're able to remember something that doesn't take us, and you say, "If everything didn't convince us!"
Besides, as you see in the patient.
"You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're testing you to wear it."
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have to take care of him, and you're watching him, because you want to see him well, and he's taking care of you.
This is the magic, it's not only beautiful to have a selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, ICU, are Christmas, who are stuck in the choir, they are more appealed, increase the number of functional diseases, our means, the same functions, and the house we don't know why it appears.
There's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no ray of things, there's a symptom.
What happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already got up and said goodbye.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are talking to me.
What we're going to talk about for a medical group, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two there.
My doctors contract.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our curve process.
To do this?
First point, the most important thing is information.
Where everyone was talking about Dr. Google, who was fashionable, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were many students, there was a book from health, and that existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's a editor, you had to have content to say, "Today, with Google, you have a very good information lesson, very important, but many, very bad."
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than climbing, so there are some things we have to think, sometimes, first information.
So, the action really hurt.
I have a blog.
In my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for anything, and that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests and money or selling games.
The city.
Second very important thing: you don't believe in good things, you're delighted, "Look, medicine has changed, now your problems have finished seriously."
Differently, a lab with a scientist will have an immediate discovery without the scientific society doesn't kill this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid color, like the industry, there's no interest that you're taking away from it.
You're low, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly some other with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
I want the information, discuss your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and development.
Take the information, take part in your cure, but enjoy your mother.
Secondly, it's very important to be active, related to the appropriate action.
To ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know who you receive that medicine.
There's a right to know the risk of that surgery: "Oh, a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I work 20 years later."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture of changing, the culture of existing, it's not to get there, fighting with everyone, it's not this, it's vaguely to know.
There is compositioning with time, we'll go.
It's to make the atendments be different.
The method you want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to have this time, they want to have it with chaos.
Audience: Yes.
Once I was in the Amazon, on the Internet, she was in Venezuela, she was a mountain, nobody was a mother.
And here we have a patient, "Oh, there's a trance of thinking."
It's the humor.
Thank you very much.
And there was no neurologist for us to bring to São Paulo, to be treated at that type of São Paulo.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, they were going because, obviously, I didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor didn't speak Germany.
I had a translator, I was the son, the boy who spoke very much about Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was obviously enjoying it.
And I belonged to a profound.
The Indius or the doctor, you know this.
Mom, that's it.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without installing the language, without having a different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interest of taking care of it.
This magic that wants the art to cure.
So you don't need to behave very hard, it happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have one.
The labs and the consultants.
So, we, doctors.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment.
There's no excuse.
All patients.
To be active in your cure process.
I wanted to do this because there was a connection.
In the world, there's better, and you'll be more well treated than that.
(Applause) Good evening, guys, I'd like to talk to the world, 35,000.
What do you think this doesn't mean?
This number is the number of decisions that I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my evolution and we gave one of the decisions that changed my evolution of taking lessons, the racing signs that had three lessons in nature, a digital structure that was the most printed to be spiritual.
The result of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how you are 25.
Because I like many experiments: for a second group, it was only an exhibition of two options, a digital option, 53 of them, and an option of how the executor processes too.
It's about 15,000 dollars: printed evolution.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in another?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
With what I wanted more to dance, I would make this decision, and I started to study about it.
I'll give you a lot of this, I'll publish this situation of the middle, and it's great, it's a way to put it in an equation, and you want people to choose the option T, our company, if I can have two, for the same, and I learned a lot about this in an internal theory.
This is impressive because I started to question the king of all this, and a talk that, including TED, gave me the Internet all over, was a talk that made a comparison.
From this involvement, I'm elected before today, because I have returned to what we see in a different way, because I have a return from the influencing, the sky to the left side and it looks a little bigger than the other side of the night, but we see it in a different way.
There's another New York use, which is what fascinates me to hear, which is this one that the fairy lifestyles are equal to low chess pieces.
It's in this moment that I'll go and say, "Yes, there's a problem in the form that I have all this."
Without addicating the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
In fact, in the same way what has returned to influencing the stage we see things, what also returns to the city is the majority of all decisions: work and technology.
We started to prepare the figure of paper, if the person was working in a project, she would add these three options, if he could pick up two options, two of the stars, two, and the team was working, was put in a way, and he didn't know how to live and invited me to work in a project, to create a training to see the insurance.
They make the drawing of the architecture of decisions where I'm making my decisions.
This caught my attention in the world of technology, and even the name of this profession, called YOEX, which is exactly the people who are the architects of decisions, working in the decision-making architecture, designing all formed and environments in all decisions.
(Video) Ricardo Chiaretti: For the first time, a friend of mine and I told him, in these theories, "You have to bring the idea to him, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior economy or the digital world, and he's superfastated, who wants to talk to you, and produces Rio Grande, who changed my way to see, and also count it.
Thank you.
If there are some people who have a smartphone, they become a crazy thing, they think we don't need much research to know that we use a lot of cell phone, or outside the bathroom, or look at it, but they get a research in the company that says it's a little bit like this: 22 hours per bed.
And this open curve, how many of these 35 million decisions we make, is that you can add to it in a new way, so, from these 35 million digital decisions?
In these universities, this register is a "ozando" and a digital camera, or that the tool they used many times is not one of us, that I'd start to ask myself about it.
Is it that I put my flight and this horizon as a person, who interacts this lesion as I am?
Is all the decisions we're going to study, what we're going to talk about today, and that's what we're talking about, and we put the "wes," how many decisions we're trying to deal with the power?
For the world, the city was called "Noes," it's "waste," it's Google.
(Laughter) (Laughter) In this case, it's a monkey in Austria, it's 91% and, in fact, the map is 4% - we'll see that there's a number of drawings, (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) in this case, it's a number of title for two and a few.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, because in Austria you're already a teenager?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Denmark, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word called "deflow".
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to ask to leave.
(Laughter) Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there and go for it.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days.
And here I have two options: one to receive the senses and the other to receive the offer, the recipes were dismartened to the open and was killed.
Someone decided I wanted to offer because I didn't want to go there and go out.
(Laughter) I asked to get out of the audience's mark and recycle markets.
Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked, so I grabbed this and couldn't go out, if I went, I went to the audience, and I thought it was cool to meet another person, but I talked a lot about Uber.
Then I found this again and told a story.
And a lady chose the Q.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
She looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage in the car?"
He looked at him and said, "If he chose the cube."
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, Marse Learning chose not to know what was already chosen by it, it's very complicated, it's very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are, if we are Google today to research where people eat, there are 567,000 results.
What is a click agent?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Can we choose a place where people eat, it was me, it wasn't Google?
After that, what I do, I'll read the click on the website.
(Laughter) I love Perfect, I see from there what parents don't go to the right page.
(Laughter) You're going to ask this.
These little English and English have a name in the Constamental Economy as well as the name, they are called "innatives."
It's exactly a little empurried in English, I'd like to ask you to take a little bit of the person on your side, "Don't realize what to have ... (Laughter) It's a little bit like this: don't you have a book called Dante?
And the concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, in a simple way, to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought, "Canuces?
(Laughter) And in this talk, I wanted a picture, and it was important to see ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austreet in Denmark.
Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
At that moment, I wrote "Auscinstreduire" in the TEDx of a person, you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life, (Laughter) the one explains me.
If you don't want to be too low, you have to click on this link and ask to leave, how many people were there, more than 400 inscribed people?
In other words, one of the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave, (Laughter) So this means that I keep building all the decisions of the life of 13 people who stayed together and I show the results.
Generally, what do people do with their fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Necessity of data.
This can make us manipulate someone.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do what someone buys, it's something she doesn't need, so you can use good.
Like, for example, you can use it.
To make a patient with diabetes leave the moment, it's even more harmful.
Or you can use it?
To avoid truck accidents like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the medition.
From the brain waves, it's to detect a kitchen to edit an accident.
So, in these 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016.
People in the world have 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine that was this?
Doctors of Pokémon Go.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we're immersed in this world of increased reality, virtual reality, learning machine.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better.
How do these nano bubbles work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We will be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware for us to make better decisions.
Thank you.
