It's like the residence of people with disabilities.
What if there's any difference?
Or should it have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to play clothes?
Does anyone's help need?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
From then on, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their own life.
What about necessities?
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took them to the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made them lose the fall of the piece, when they lost a lot of time, and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist ...
It was this: making clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
And I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of this piece.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form expensive, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to talk to others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena, a blouse that was opening in the shoulders with pressure button, to facilitate, at the time, to pass the head.
In fact, for people?
They are quadriplegics, the ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegic.
that gives autonomy to be able to dress alone.
AC: In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for courtyard?
I made a website.
Well ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote the name of remembering him to identify that that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information, like size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status, the ideal.
It's to think about pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, childhood sessions of the shops, imagine clothes with princesses and colorful ones.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and that means.
More than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking and are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Stamped materials, more likely and technological materials.
Did you know?
It was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world, which is already in the last edition: I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"Me?"
Silvana.
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their schools.
But it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who were already launched the second inclusive collection, due to the size of success, which was the first, and the target also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
It's to look at others.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
More than in the future.
I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much.
My family has always come from the face.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
What about my life?
(Laughter) The middle of the forest?
And it was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus?
I went to work with children.
Children of four years old.
Until adolescence, and it's going through an adult, my community.
Do you start working with DJ?
And I was designing people, "How?
What about this?
Knowing how to separate one's trash.
So I tried to talk to the child and it was winning the parents' awareness.
The parents were catching.
GB: Do you deliver me to children?
People recognize me in the community.
(Laughter) I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate.
But today I feel like an educator.
Audience: Yes.
I do with the children I know.
In my community, we have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
To work with this tree, we have a plant.
I said, "Oh!
What I met a plant called her name of Engar.
(Laughter) It's a light plant.
What we plant from all under it: it's a plant that recovers the ground's fast.
Audience: And all the plants I had.
Her belly.
Are we?
There's a good result.
AC: And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
(Laughter) I met.
That all plants ...
Is it used?
Each one in their place.
(Laughter) But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth, right?
(Laughter) So, do you have to imitate the forest?
(Laughter) Because there in the arm.
I had a lot.
(Laughter) Praga, who was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
Audience: Yes.
So I tried to plant them.
I said, "Go on!
(Laughter) There I have the "Asaíu", the graviol, Andiróba, Copaíba.
with Moru, Guaraná, and everything on the beach.
(Laughter) "Light, eat?"
I said, "That's natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of touch."
Raise your hand.
(Laughter) And the fruit of there...
Five separation of ours: in our community, we work there, everything with organism.
AC: You eat everything natural.
AC: There's no toxic in our community.
Wow!
(Laughter)
I said, "Can you buy your brother?"
Like an animal.
(Laughter) The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
Do you speak?
She's listening, and then she's going through other children.
I said, "I'm paying and I'm coming to this tension."
Then he talks to the animal quote.
(Laughter) So, I compare the child.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
The biggest thing for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything in the eye, "My father says this.
AC: The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person.
Because I observed my house.
I was observing my house.
I stayed at my wife.
(Laughter) She always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So ...
I saw that all this with my work was doing with children.
What's the future?
(Laughter) It would work out.
And today we have it.
It's a job inside.
It's far from the human being.
"Shut up, don't take it!"
(Laughter) When I started there.
It started in a thousand children, for those who don't know what's far from the human being?
It's the Amazon's tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son.
Today we're broadcast 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river that's before.
I had a dam.
AC: In front of you.
But it's like this a little of our community.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) This dam didn't disappear.
And it ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
AC: Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're getting there.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
So I'm going to pass to this person.
AC: Nowadays, when I talk about it...
And the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) Respire a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest?
(Laughter) It's always talking to people educating children.
I'm going through other people.
And I have a message to leave a very small phrase here.
That I'm like that.
(Laughter) When I'm in the community, do people come to me?
Do you get closer to us?
Are we talking about it and allowing people?
And I'm very happy.
(Laughter)
I'm yours, if I don't go through it.
My message, my education for other people, I even feel guilty.
AC: Absolute and thank you very much, guys.
I got married with a name, I had two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children.
It's very proud.
It's also my family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
And to create this woman.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
That's it.
It puts the life of the Enrice.
Imagine all the most guys you're here.
Like we don't feel this.
It's like a method that loses a challenge.
And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find out.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, what he needs to be cured, from then on, it was very incredible because all the most of the school and all the other friends, "Wow!
They did a very big movement, sharing the press, the social networks, everywhere, taking people, touching blood, medulating.
It was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for all the time.
The first message was...
And when?
A child has leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
And we learned to be this lesson.
And it spreads to our friends, to the most in school, to society, people in Facebook.
I'm talking about truth, it doesn't matter what problem I had.
It doesn't matter.
The most important thing is life, fight for life and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
(Audience) Yes.
What are people?
They saw us as a homosexual, a parental man.
It's not a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men.
Or two women.
Or a father of a mother to be in the family?
Or a living father, or a divorced warrior?
The important thing is that I love the family, that union, that gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that the other thing happened to us.
With this disease, for the world?
It's that my blood, my hatred, we were able to manufacture it.
Our favour.
The blood is only painful, I'm a human being to donate for another human, so that elephant, or that consciousness, we don't have that ability.
(Laughter) Dedoar blood for those who need it.
For someone who has a house, I don't know.
The blood is needed in the parks.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks are precise, and donating medula osse, driving as a medulator, the chances of compatibility.
Between one to two.
And a patient is from one over 100,000 people, so if you...
You can save life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get a bit of the stars.
(Laughter) For me, it was a very beautiful moment of power.
I hope they call me so that I can save in my life without any effort, without any pain, I'm donating a part of me to be able to save in my life, and that's what is the message.
Or so credit happens to all of us.
I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling, that support conditioned, is not to save life as big.
In other words, for having that awareness that we can all do blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
(Audience) Paz, for you.
Be it like you.
This is the exhaustion.
Two slams.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Tama.
The Syrian capital.
In January, I studied at Damas' University.
Today.
A refugee story.
DB: No, that's it.
With my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Hi, Arab, E.A.
A good code.
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
(Audience) Today.
And I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
Let's see, block insects.
(Audience) OK, there's a slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A war church.
The beer was beautiful, calm, cheap.
It's easy to live, the population.
It was 23 million people.
GB: I got it.
And my family.
My friends, what did I know?
From that child.
Three flashes of clothes: Open Sculture, Engineering, two apartments.
I have a car.
In Tamas.
(Laughter) I liked traveling.
And I loved it.
To know the world, I went to the country.
AC: Like the United States.
(Audience) Spaniard.
AC: It's cold.
Until one day.
She started the war, March 15.
It's 2011.
It's indigenous.
After that.
I say to all the other ideas.
It's from Bahia.
I had my mask city.
It was the safer of Syria.
I had between 20 and 25 bombs.
Good morning.
Hi!
I'm five years of war.
Mine country is this one.
(Audience) Destrói.
Let's see.
Those who know it were, thank you.
Carigans.
Oh, Cadapa!
She gave us her children.
They found their wives.
Spread and mutilated.
"Well, a bomb."
Familiaries.
It will sound and not come back.
Mine.
The last years in the series were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did I leave to work?
I know how to see my family again or not.
Today.
Millions of Syrian will be stuck, dead or refugee in other countries.
I'm my family.
We were there.
Very sad.
When we have to leave Syria, well, we're not guarantees.
And our life takes you back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day.
I still love there, in my brother, in my country, and I don't know if I live them again.
To protect my family.
I went to Bara Bahirut.
Hi!
Ten months.
And sobe that Brazil was open to doors.
Stop Syrian, try.
I went to talk in Baixada Brasileira.
(Audience) And deserate.
That São Paulo was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
(Laughter) Why did they have more opportunities?
And I saw Pinas.
A week to leave Brastrada.
For 40 years.
From my life?
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
PC: Orial?
11 years old.
It was.
As a result, today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday.
And they all talked very well, the food my good businesses talked a lot.
I approached it.
What is the kitchen?
Very good.
And to make food?
To sell.
That's when I created Bagina no Facebook or Talal with the Syria idea, that's why now.
But everything has a channel.
I said, "It's a number, it's a palace."
And I make food between them.
Boru WhatsApp.
We are happy in Brazil.
We thank them.
From the Brazilian people.
AC: You.
Open the pots.
When the world was closed.
Good evening.
Etress, who is at the end of war and attacks.
I'm Togoris.
"Wow!
That's it, guys.
I had an wrong idea.
It's about Ossirio.
I'm Joey Isla.
Today, tomorrow, here.
Or a journalist says, "Hey!
And then?
What happened in France?
Now, I don't want to talk.
To talk.
Or contact with a personal man.
A human being.
Let's think!
I'd like blood.
That it's to be killed in name.
From religion.
AC: But exactly ...
Oops!
"Hi, how cool!"
What happened, my father?
It was a crime, not about French.
More, also Branuse.
Or Syrian, Islamic State?
It's an organization.
Togorists who are using the image of Islam.
A religion.
It's a base.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book since kills a person.
Without it had killed another, or similar to corruption, on Earth, it's as if it killed all men.
And that it gives them life.
It will be as if life, to all men, Alkurão, lasts your mother, Brás Polo, 32 hours.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, Sunita, like this.
My life in Brazil showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between the sky.
They are Brazilians, even with the differences.
Culture and religion.
When people come to a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, they ask me, "Why do you use this heat?"
A silencing at home, OK?
In T-Jabi, there are other keys.
Men in Molière.
And they can't touch themselves, embrace, embrace.
Exceptions are good at marriage, some people tell me, but I've already seen human beings doing all this.
Kebeijam is the hug, let's see, so the slam has these rules.
What else?
It's going from each person to want to eat, or not, it's fine.
Bruibbe, some things do, the same way they have to be established that they don't obey everything, it's not so good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Oh, it's PCSO.
It's more than a partner.
And that never happened to me.
"Why?"
Because those things are exhausted from isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
What else?
Ah, that's it!
To not get to know Mozla.
Then, the agency is explained.
People always understand and respect.
The perfect woman says that we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value that we should have beauty with everyone.
It doesn't matter, it's saved white.
I'm a black guy.
And Indians, or slam Tabéndez, that we must help the people who need, every year we have or Elsaacá.
And we removed two.
Good afternoon.
Five, for sure.
of all our money for people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystados, today.
And the convete or you.
Learn more.
It's about O islam.
I'm sure.
(Laughter) It was something.
It's to understand what a religion is.
Let's go.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil?
And that the world knows the best Islam.
(Laughter)
NJ: Precocient.
That's how my children.
And it's your child.
Wow, power!
I grew up.
I said, "Let's go."
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, I always say, "Let's wait for the cancer, who always believes, always reaches, my salary ends, just like this race."
I studied the girl, what they told me, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I had a lot, a cook.
Fascinera.
Why don't you hire me in the mall, I don't understand this if you put me so much to pay a secret course?
But who enters the office?
Opa, sorry, I had an event between five.
To clean everything and wash the bathroom, the days pass, the months fly, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation, "DO, ME," is to be the domestic, if it were for the option of the well-being situation.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the Pagina's success, the page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 this year, she still didn't complete four months.
And since I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was at home of vacation, due to everyday race, sometimes there's no time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I got a day in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live near the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a domestic employee.
And, as I use Facebook as a newspaper, I put everything that happens to me, my mother even brings me, "Hey, all you can do Facebook is tomorrow, it's my new newspaper, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
And then I warned the guys, "Mrs. Lembrança, some stories will start betting on Facebook and rejecting domestic employees, so that, in this case, other people have already gone through this too, and then I'll be following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santo.
In 2009, I was hired to be a cook, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at home and not the bathroom.
In her house.
What was the domestic bathroom?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and that was always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last stories and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to several media.
So much the international media, the national media, London babies, television and Germany, and many others.
What I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype that everyone, all of them moved a lot when I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose themselves and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism, the most valued domestic domestications earn for hours, so totally different from our country.
It's a job announcement that I called "abusive announces," for example, an announcement I read.
PL: It was for workers.
And to work as a second.
The sixth.
From 8 am.
At 18.
Ganning 380 Brazilian reais.
For day, no, a week, much less, a month.
Three and 80 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a gigantic library, and I've always liked to read, but books, even today, cost very expensive, there are domestics, going through these conditions, not being able to use the bathroom and suffer all the books I've always been to fly.
This became a daily practice, so what I did was arrive at her house, gathered everything rapidly, left half an hour to clean, to the TV, and Haly was sitting riding me with those books, and to my surprise, the Regina enters the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing about the experiences I had already spent in the past, and then she started to indicate several texts without studying, I said, "Wow, my dream is to be a teacher in history, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
And to conveil the university.
With the gangs, because I entered the university, everything was solved, no, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarized some texts.
I prefer to enter the room to make proof that it's very difficult to concilate a totally heavy job with the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues, and to show that slavery still didn't end.
There are women working in analyses of slavery.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but there was, in this world, a woman called Lao delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, at the age of 60s, created the first syndrome of domestics, and she was known by the media of the time as the land of the patterns.
All of this when I comment and show some stories.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort, we can change some things.
Nobody will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
MP: The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
That's it.
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman, why do I say it's the sedentary service, my grandmother?
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic.
When I got there to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I stayed without understanding, but she already knew that everything she had happened.
While working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
(Laughter) Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum.
Without photos, they called me, at least, a interview.
I took a suspicious, this after a graduation, OK?
I took a dirt to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so, "Are you?"
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Applause) And I always say what was the big house in the past.
They are the illusion apartments.
What they were like.
Domestic slaves in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us.
They are domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She arrived.
I was running, and I was nervous.
What I was waiting for a long time for her to get, "You're on a paid Friday, I listened to her entering the car, the noise of the key opening the door."
"Wow, my pattern came."
And then, when I arrive, with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Hey Mina, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take your money, Monday Tipago."
The modern senior is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was little, with so much hair and affection, her mother would always work, she didn't have much time for her.
But all the needs she had and suffered was me who was there.
I only wanted to see her marrying, that's it, but, unfortunately, they didn't invite me for marriage, but, as I'm daring, I put my best clothes.
I went to the church and stayed there hidden.
And I could see my girl marrying.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
It's Christmas.
I'm seeing my four-year-old family, everybody happy.
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because the modern sixth is modern.
It's almost the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work.
He's going to work, he takes air.
His wife to work.
Tell it to his wife who's going to work, but he returns.
For the house.
For me, I was arrested.
And the only solution I had was to get rid of.
Coppies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get into it.
If I clean the bathroom, I get stuck.
And that's how I can flee from his seeds.
Because when I say I'm going to change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,800 Brazilian reais per month."
"I'll win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children in northeast, and they need this money.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of saving.
Because my little kitchen is my opinion.
And then I was there.
And in the service line, pressed, I picked my little bit of soviet.
That's the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you?
The little power to save, if the toilet uses, what's happening, no, your bathroom can use?
Because in the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought little potatoes.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the little box of the employee.
Today I'm here.
Unlike statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine.
Because when I told my pattern, I wanted to study.
Do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be happy with you."
That's the attention!
His grandfather wasn't domestic?
Only the mother wasn't domestic, she's already predicted for her family.
"Yes."
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda!
I'm sorry.
Seriously!
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and rage.
Oh, my side!
I'm not alone here today.
Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they'll be there.
What do I do?
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But just to see that six million domestic women are being represented now?
And many aren't watching me, but they'll be able to watch this figure, that they're cleaning, that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone is there.
And it must be worth it.
There are four, many patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why do babies have to be dressed as white, it's uniform, yes, to be able to understand?
And she's inside her house, isn't the pattern that she's a nanny, but it's not to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country?
So I'm here and control in the United States.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million dolls.
It's one of the Africans in every day.
I'm here today to talk.
Absolutely.
Silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
For the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Take off your cell phone.
Not a photographer.
Even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago.
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then, I was doing the 8th, the conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Listen to your eye, open the pot, and it's safe, put the equipment.
Spread inflammation points.
The first past of the dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this.
From this chaos, of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of present.
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
In this feeling, of this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation that you have in front of you.
You're you.
Potentially.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't believe, the X doesn't have sex, you're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's in class.
And it was very pleasant.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know who lived a big mine.
[A.DE.]
They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then the discovery was.
Everything I had already experienced.
That's it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act, I was determining people how I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you.
He only stood his gold.
I'm going to talk about many of you.
Think.
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone because all of you have it.
"My daring."
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You sleigh, come this step.
Don't get rid of you, it's unleasant.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then?
AC: You go after, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close them.
And you, who were anoting our notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Internal connection: those who connect to the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back, look at me, look.
To the stage.
Then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "I'm going to look at her in this way."
I said, "You're fine, you've got even watched."
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
What did you see?
Audience: Yes.
(Exhaling) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that is born.
It's fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
And in Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
Forty sense of direction?
There's a knowledge.
You know where you are.
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system.
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at that moment, a different piece.
Really, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a legal vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space localization system to your minimum space.
What about volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, it's new, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
It's realizing that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
A habit in our lives.
These are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
And on the planet, along with our aggressive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them.
So available, it's simple.
But it's the last generation technologies.
We already know that in the future, the evolution of race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
The silencing is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never fallen in love?
For a TEDx talk that had the first video.
(Laughter) And, normally, it's the first view, as my case was, I can say that it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so seductive.
What is the idea of translations?
I'm from a demand of a legion in the end of the TEDx.
What did they understand to bring society?
In a shared area with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
(Video) Narrator: In the case of your Brazil.
The work of translation is essential once it's worth it.
Five percent of people agree with the development of prediscity.
That's it.
Five percent, at least, have influence in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Actually.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's translated into 16 and young people.
(Video) And almost always 26,000 translations made at the moment.
But we're only translated.
Like also transcendants.
The talks made in events like these here.
The work of transition is very important, not only to take our TEDx around the world.
(Laughter) But I compare to allow people with hearing impairment.
I manage to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk wasn't in English?
He said, "My case here, it's less Portuguese.
The first one is transcribed.
(Laughter) "Your name is Engineeral."
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more beautiful.
Because, initially?
The TEDx with its own looptype indicates, putting them on topics as "technology" and "tertainment," which is the "e" we can translate as entertainment.
(Audience) And do you think?
Paulo referred to each other.
(Laughter) Nowadays.
Things add an inferiority of subjects that go from disadvantage to political, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature, we have, for example, talks, and form the works of science.
Another of my ambitions.
Let's stop what it comes out.
But the theme is excellent.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest life expectancy.
And also the reduction of human work's journey throughout people.
I think it's clear that one of the use I do of my hearing partner ...
It's translating and wanting to transcribe as a bubble false in the TEDx environment.
And they can be the "self-prox," TEDx talks, or the TV series are educational videos, even children in a small one.
And I do this not only.
Because translating is a passion, and the country is a key word in my life.
(Laughter) Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be a trox, to be black.
(Laughter) Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember that translator is a privileged reader.
(Laughter) Not only that helps me deal with my anxiety, but a very anxious person, not only a charming, sometimes I say that translating only more than half an hour and hours a day, spent two or three hours and this happens with me in the storms.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here to receive.
People stretching.
But why do I think my time is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence.
In these actions, like this.
That's what I want.
How much dangerous is heavy?
I said, "Let's open your name."
(Video) Raise your hand if you're here.
This is potentially because I don't have a doubt and education.
It's fundamental for them.
And I don't have a doubt, that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged.
With a few criminals, two excluded to our society.
(Laughter) They can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when is the fish in the volunteer work?
(Laughter) I think it's a donation work.
Whether it's easy, I have, whether I donate, if I know fear?
"Are you going to play an object?"
And just because I'm a volunteer job.
Because if I don't choose my own, it's my decision.
I have to do it in the best way.
At the beginning?
I tried to commit myself.
To donate the time that's left.
It's different to donate the works.
And the rest of the monsters.
The tradition is a complex activity that remains not only to know.
The Ministry, the World Cup, mainly.
Audience: At our age.
And it's already a picture.
What a young man!
It's a perfect translation.
(Laughter) There's always.
A dream of knowledge instead.
A lot of research.
I said, "Mom, Stardo.
(Video) Narrator: A lot of dreams.
Let's see.
And, on the other hand, a simple translation to be good businesses?
There's always a degree that I've tasted.
What a result, how do you do?
Because the best thing we do, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be improved almost undefinitely.
And here I need to remember.
What is the great majority of our volunteers?
It's not professional, this is very important to decide.
Most of them.
But what about it?
(Laughter) That's it: we create the quality of our history.
I'm not only in respect to the speaker, but without respect to those who are old.
And to guarantee this quality, all this action.
Traduations and transcessions.
And it goes through a revision made by the troops and volunteers.
Finally, they would be approved by a coordinator or a language coordinator.
Or as we call it "DC."
In the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
We have six pieces.
We have Maricene.
GV: Claudia.
Why me?
I have our parents.
And who are "what" of God?
I liked it.
The owner, or the sun.
What's the guy doing?
The world is OK.
This obsession that I have with education?
MA: Isn't that possible?
Audience: I'm a kid.
AC: Not only.
What about Brazil?
That lives a deep, political crisis, that the education is connected to the bread's cycle, but without even my own personal story.
My father.
That today it would be two years if it was possible, but it had the primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study further because I was studying and make some studying children.
That's why the one who lived in our little building of our girls called Tairobeiras.
He decided to change his four children at the time, I'll go to many slides, the biggest city we live in.
In some sides, my father used to sell his beginning his logic to the Uberas, and his site also knew, as a commercial, he had a material of a presence store.
Isn't it?
In 1964, there was a great presence for Brazil.
I due to this reception, and other reasons: my father went to the talk and lost everything.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in the cells.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his father's name, and my father decided.
And then deceive payments.
If changing for Belo Horizons as a cold behind, eating well the obstacles.
The first horizon.
My mother, who today has a few years old, is my hearing, right?
Also, being a waiting for young people to stop and still today.
It was not knowing about cooking.
So, for many years in my house, wherever it was to literally win the channel channel, "Digacide-passage" from the worst peoples in the horizon.
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and I didn't love, it was that we were destroyed to study.
And that's it.
And it was done.
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the national research for samples and homicides.
In the 48-year-old faix, only 32% of people with higher insolarity.
Soundly.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had for education?
(Laughter) What did they seem?
In the Middle Ages, my father, for example, had the Miteló habits.
Understanding, when I was seven, at that time, we were going to college entrance exams.
And a vocalist thinks, "And the piggyprogram," "I'm a bug," I'm a bubble, I'm a bit angry, I need to be in jail.
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, he was checking me, shaking, without knowing, he was having a little in this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than this today, we managed to give our children better conditions than we had, and here I say, for me, the greatest passion in my life, in my opinion, are our beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
The ones I've never put this rock to my newspaper for me, but for those I've asked all the nights.
And about the stories of all of them?
(Laughter) So the adventure was always a pleasure for me and four of my children.
Coincident who, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
At some point in physics.
And one of the brothers is the primary educator, also fantastic, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite our limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has a priority inside our house.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
It has just been created by the fact that TEDx, just like my father, was a simple manager, inspired us, just like today, inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us.
To spread the idea.
What makes us believe?
Do you think?
We can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where she explained how she worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then she taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it was super complicated, and I started to write the letters from dots to my notebook.
And I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule.
It's a little girl who allows me to write in Braille, where you write that shows the release, I ended up full of my notebook and my agenda.
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to her that I was learning, and I still gave tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "maker" course in the "Cross" school, and we thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, we wouldn't have thousands of processes, we would take one on the Internet and be ready when it's in the engines, and we would have a clock, but saw that there was no Internet, so we decided to create our own.
We started to research, learn about robotics, programming, our teachers, and try to set up the clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors.
The Pinos showed him to our aunt, it was very exciting and recognized everything, and it started to work, and more or less a month ago we finished the clock and showed the hours and minutes in Braille for you to feel, for a while it didn't work, and it only shakes us.
And they encouraged us to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very emotional.
The whole process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
And use them to change this world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
It could help in the kitchen inclusion and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't ended.
The high school, we're second year and we're teenagers, we managed to create something innovative.
(Laughter) There's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships.
In other words, with other adults.
Maybe we don't.
Okay, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference.
Now, with sexual relationships that dance commercials.
It's a motor exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
There's another part with an objective.
It must obtain pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men.
There are women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients.
It's also important.
In October.
There are street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults that are correct.
The failure that involves us at 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are cases of belief.
These are cases that must be followed.
This criminal is judicially.
I said, "Yes."
The delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual empression.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent volunteer institution and fossil fuel.
We're also not going to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
According to the depth of prostitution.
On the contrary, sexual exploration, but taking all the people who make prostitution for victims of sexual traffic, is confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
The investigations have shown that falls in Portugal.
In other words, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few necessary.
In fact, they are phenomenon.
That's what they identify us, but that they can cross.
And to have a notion.
In fact, what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic, which is the state organism that changes the river, the information about relationship issues with human traffic.
And that there are relatively two thousand accesses, which are the last available data.
It indicates that they were Portugal confirmed 118 victims of traffic.
It's human.
What do you do for likely exploration?
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's just three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that it creates a whole speech and a half.
What are the results of reality?
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution.
Like victims.
I'm very happy.
It's mixed.
There's something waiting for someone.
I wanted salvae.
And this doesn't correspond to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we knew.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings such as gender inequality.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people have to immigrate.
There are economic inequalities.
There are social and cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of constraints.
That influenced the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when we meet.
Investigator, I interviewed conversations, I'm with the people who do sex work.
What they say is that they were an option, a pondrated option.
After I mentioned the advantages.
And disadvantage that is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly witnessed and not recognized.
What if I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
Sure.
It's when you think of a person who prostitute.
Think.
Okay?
And I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Where is a woman?
It's a sort of bad aspect.
It's from Ministry.
It's in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
What is very likely about the toxic of the loss.
Surely, there's someone exploring.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images.
That they don't reflect with rigor.
It's reality.
There's a very big diversity.
There are people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Of practices, of experiences, not all of us have positive experiences, but not all of us have negative experiences.
And of life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped with us, we thought about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are constant and defeated.
And the identity.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century.
Plete Saint-Drop.
What will it represent?
There are only about 10 birds.
I feel.
The total of people deposit themselves.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
It's just minority, but they're not in intelligence.
Let's give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the person in Dias, from Lisboa University, and that interviewed 140 blind workers, both in the context of the street, as in context.
In the countryside, men, women, trans people.
And that, in all the country, found 10.2 percent of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
Don't forget if it's a percentage of men who are.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
BP: Although it may appear.
I had an apparently humanist idea.
When we analyze the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And what is the idea of the client's criminalization?
She's in Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not.
It's prohibited to sell sex.
That's it, but I wanted to buy sex.
The idea is at the base of this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims.
His iniciation.
And, therefore, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects after Sweden.
And the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, namely the non-vernamental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they tell me that this law puts in greater rivers.
There are the own dry flavors who put rich people to know how to drive.
And that increases its sustainability.
There's violence.
What about stigma?
It's the disease.
Another idea we have is that all people.
That this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Hmm...
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until research has shown that the relationships between workers of sex and clients.
They are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is dehumane.
They are people.
Because they are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through gender professionals.
"Do you know what to take?"
This is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure.
And many of them can make blind professionals.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is assistant, sexually, is someone who receives to know how to have sexual relationships with people who are disabled, and now who destroy any argument that tries it to be done.
It's one of the customer criminalization.
So, if people?
You can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think it's the best option in that moment of their life to make it easy.
To your people.
There are these economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
It can be done everything.
It controls the knowledge of work, if this can be done.
It's more exploration than in our work activity, why do we continue?
To condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, he had a sexuality and considered.
Digitimate.
It's normal and natural.
And on the other hand, we have a security and it's considered illegitimate.
It's normal.
I felt natural and that's when it started in the sky.
The fact that this century is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural is based on stigmatization.
It's the social rejection, the description of the sanction, the devalorization of people who do this activity.
"Thank you!"
This is a brand with deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes.
The stigma is a form of violence.
It's at the base of so much discrimination about sex observers, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the field of justice and social security, they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" followed women in two types, tied and downloaded.
Seriously and not serious, those who behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument.
This is the service of the feminine sexuality, it's a kind of lady's sphere that is above the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if they had a sexual behavior that was disappointed, normal clients, socially restricted.
Correct!
The freedom of being stigmatized by puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
It's so cool!
Why do I think we can do any of us?
It's so that they don't continue to disrespect blind founders.
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
There's a boat!
Let's go back to the sheet.
Like a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
To challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give voice.
That is, listening to sex workers.
Dar voice to a group that has been.
There was something of the most attempt to see silencing throughout time.
The secret employees.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70, but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have credibility, they're not heard.
In other words, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights.
And that's what I think we have to follow.
After all this.
And to finish?
I think it's useful.
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize the employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
Hello.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Artic, well cured, art, healing being a doctor.
It's surrounded by a fundamental stone, in the medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to get involved, spiritually, in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion.
And I'm going to give you a pair.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and so that I can play the best treatment for that day.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship with our time, with all the most superficial and rare, and I'm this equilibrium suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
Audience: Yes.
Diversity.
When did we get there?
In our arrogance, I lost.
And I thought I was going to take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
That's it.
That's it.
I entered a feeling with what I wouldn't have since childhood.
And to relate to someone who needed to know how to do, and to be able to offer to that person that involvement, that attention.
(Laughter)
(Audience) Hi.
It's cool, right?
Audience: Yes.
"I don't come, I ask you to walk."
(Laughter)
All the doctors who go with us and go from there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo what we bring to another daily practice.
(Audience) Yes.
The simplification that happens there can be replicated here too.
It's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
It was the path I had to cover.
What's moving?
At the beginning of medicine college.
If you take a list of objective toys, the first objectives are there.
Altruism is fine.
And these same students.
And, at the end of the medical group, with the same research, the "top" of the succession.
Keeping, cure.
Some time we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant, poet.
And we delivered someone in technical, who knows a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The old relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back to the hospital.
(Audience): No.
Because it's the weight, in medicine, where is the father, in medicine, what's the stage.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't made.
(Video) When I love it, I swallow the apple.
The Eva desengastated, and this was to make a stone airplane.
It's what we do so much.
"I don't play the same thing."
So why does the church consider, instead, medicine and father teach me why for the first time?
He got a goal.
It can.
Hello.
It's curating, something that can be taught.
I learned, reproduced and applied.
And, in a way, the involvement of these people had a logic.
A higher education.
The video was created in the Pope's Union.
Because until today it's used.
It's a mixture.
It was done in a state of 80 BC.
I'm an apple.
Don't talk to me.
You're in three words.
In all houses here.
I just talked about the benefit of the diseases.
It's editing all the bad volunteer and corruption.
Especially the seduction of women, men, children and serves.
That's it.
And they become respecting the life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
And if I respect this judgment and didn't hear it there.
It would be the title of returning between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already in that time, if I worry about this, and still today, you do the surgery?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because we have to be transcribed.
Because the best patient's relationship is essential for good care.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered by the UN judgment, and, in this case, I saw a honor to participate in a profession that is conducted by a judgment.
The medical knowledge in Greece is an individual.
To produce science in a way that the next could go further.
What can I do?
The medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable.
To absorb all this knowledge.
So today, a patient has a team of doctors, and I'm going to have a class, and this class is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot, encouraging this, and we'll lose the cure of the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class at college, at a small group, as a teacher.
(Audience) Yes!
And I didn't know what to do.
Look, patients have thomography, resonance, and enthusiasm and mutation.
If I look for your hand in the belly, it's not in case of consciousness.
I said, "Yes, I'm less."
The future keeps me up calling me and says, "Let's see the network.
I saw the patient's finger and noticed what was saying and didn't smoke anymore.
The hole of five times showed he had Emanie.
The mothers on Earth.
It's crazy and sweet, you can see.
If he's building care.
Right?
The dirty can say a lot, "Oh, when you're wearing a patient, you'll have a moment of intimacy, you can remember something that didn't give you in the consultation."
If all this didn't convince me?
Besides, as you see in the patient.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're telling you to extend me.
And at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good, that you're asking him, leave the care of you.
This is this magic.
She's not just beautiful to say "yes" but she's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, and are appealed better, but Apple has a higher highest cause.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, but we don't know why it appears.
I don't have exam operation, I don't have external interactions, I don't have Haluty, I don't see anything, the diseases have symptoms.
And what happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already told me, it's very nice.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and to be passive to those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk about a medical group.
Because, in the end, the act of relationship is not merce.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two areas.
There are the doctors against the two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, that was in our curve process, but also by developing your cure process in the decisions of this process.
Let's do it.
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
And where we're talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were many copies this size in my health care.
There was a book, a book of health, and this existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, for you to know someone, publish something, because it's a publisher, you have to have content to say, "Today, there's a group, you have a very good information teach, a lot of things, and we need to know how to filter."
The ability to generate information is greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think of seeing information first.
In this way, I'm usually affected.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 or 3% of people inside my curriculum, but I know who I am, that gives me a huge chat because people get there, because they allow me for nothing to study bad, because this put me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, and sell media or other things like this.
So, the signature, according to the very important thing: it doesn't believe that society will hardly be a conscious laboratory, it will have an immediate discovery, without the society to be matured, it does time, the information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's something that discovered today and tomorrow is on the Internet, and my mother doesn't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid color, like the industry, there's no interest you're going to say.
You're downwhelming the information.
It's hardly some other with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president, and finally.
Take the solution, discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information, in the same knowledge, information and development requires information, participatively from its cure.
Second thing, it's very important to be active and national.
In a processic action, it's asking, demanding, knowing.
When you talk about your doctor, you have the right to know who you receive that medicine.
If there's a right to know the risk of that surgery, you can't say, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to understand me, I work 20 years."
And I know it took time.
But I don't think this will change today, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture of it.
To exist is not to get there fighting with everyone.
I said, "How is this?"
Slowly, OK?
There is compositioning with time.
To make the atendments be different.
The doctors want it.
They want to have money.
They don't want to be tried at the same time, they want to have it.
Let's see.
Because I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, even in Venezuela, it was a mountain, in the human area.
And we had a patient there, that had cancer of time.
A moon.
Let's see.
And there was no neurologist, so we brought São Paulo to be treated here in the field.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, it was still, I didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor, obviously, didn't speak Germany, had a translator, it was the son who said very good at Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was likely scared.
And I presented a profound.
Because for me, it would give us a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the doctor, is it like this.
That's it.
The doctor was there.
What I'm trying to say with this is that, at that moment, magic happened.
What an individual?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul to that other individual, had all the interests to take care of him.
Is this magic?
Because it's the art of going to cure, so I don't need to tell a lot about it, it happens.
At that moment, we talk about it, I have a lot of thought, and there are doctors attending in main characters, in ambulatory.
In consultants, what about it?
It's anonymous.
I'm doing it.
By cutting the good fight.
What's the problem?
What's going on?
What about us, right?
We can try to find.
The more unity in our most compassion treatment.
I said, "All the patients?"
Try to be active in your cure process, because it's not doing it, because of a connection, and the world will be better, and you'll be more disappointed.
Good evening.
I wanted to start with the world here: 35,000.
What are you doing in this environment?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being drinks every day.
And if it gives more or less a decision every two seconds.
There are people.
(Audience): Yes.
They stop making a decision for those who have been ready to do that and talk.
I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my evolution of making decisions.
The experiment was done with this journalist, Eicorans.
Cities of the journalist had three innovations in this nature.
It's a digital nature with 59 dolls.
A journalist's structure prizes the citizens' brain that has a slightly digital treatment, but printed by being a citizen service.
The respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how entrepreneurs are.
What I really like with these experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
For the second group, it was only two options.
Narrator: Gital Motion, 58 workers.
And we're talking about how 22 institutors too.
And very interesting is that for this group of people, most of this, I looked at a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to ask you, "What's the sound of the middle of series and 15 models of printed election?"
No one chose it.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in the egg?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
With what I wanted more to dance, I would make this decision.
And I started studying about this.
I'll tell you a lot about this: I discovered that this person is a man.
She looked at me and said,
AC: It's a volunteer, it's not equation.
To influence the issue of a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
I created a little interesting form, you can see.
As you can see, it was one or two hours without helping them.
And you want people to choose the option T.
You already know the same to see the past.
AC: This observation comes from the finger and says, "It's better for what I'll pay 100 to 25 dollars."
AC: Our company, if I like to have two, at the same time.
And this is impressive because I started to ask myself why I did everything.
And a talk, including TED, made me understand everything.
(Video) My name is Alessia, he's doing a comparison.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
I think everyone appears in the countryside.
GV: The CEO of the Understandings appears a little bigger than the south of the sidewalk.
Are you ready?
Because I have a return.
We have to study genetics at the same time we have to go.
We're going to give birth to our stomach.
But we see that it involves a different way because it involves two influences.
There's another periodic use because I was fascinated by the way I saw.
What is this one?
The hope is to need the cradle on top.
They are equal to low chess pieces.
(Video) Narrator: Is it the same life that you're going to do with your problems before you review everything?
But I'll show you what it is.
Without addicating the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, I really understood that it makes some sense to say that it has a return to us.
In the same way the volunteer has to influence the door we see both.
What has returned to the brain is the whole decision.
I work in technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an application through safety.
There were some of those who wanted to be happy.
It's a lot of option and life will not be like that.
You can choose the use of dreams, the rest, or the two.
And it will never be true, safe.
Because we were working, but they said 500 km of possibility of choice.
The worker's team is now a way to bring this choice to people.
This way was due to another profession, if the person was in the orchestra, she would add these three options.
If you think you're going to believe it, you'll see these three reasons.
It was, at the same time, fighting for the concept of the journalist of Economics.
I've just realized that there are people.
What they do is draw the architecture of decisions, where I work with decisions.
And this led me a lot of addiction: in the world of technology, there's even a name for this profession: X and Researchers, or the experience of the web, which is exactly three people.
And these are the architects of decisions: they work with the architecture of the decision, delegating all formed and environments in all decisions.
That's why I stopped my friend, if today he found a day with this guy, this guy of her, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior economy, and he told me, "Look, I've met him, I'm a privilege, and he'll have a baker with money."
I really wanted to change my review and see it as a result.
It's there that we don't need research to know that we'll use our cell phones.
That everyone lives in the third larvae, scholarship or staring at him, but I arrived at a research in Brazil that was very difficult.
AC: If you have some people who have a smartphone, do something like 22 hours a foot.
He decides to lose you, and that you advise it, it has a right time.
So, from these 35,000 decisions we make.
How many of you think these digital decisions are?
Researchal residents appeared in the USA and in the digital environment, or the digital permission of the residents of the number one of us.
I started to ask myself all this.
Is it that good or this horizon as a person?
GG: Who traveled this drawing to me?
Is it that we're going to change, and we put it on the "wes"?
The six story of my friend will tell me, "Do you want me to know this city?"
AC: How many decisions do we have in front of the power?
It's for the digital world to talk about us.
Narrator: Is it today?
(Applause)
You need electricity.
Speaking of drugs, I'm going to talk to you about another interesting problem.
It's a wall in Austria, it's 91%, and in the diagram it's equal to you.
You may have wondered, I thought it was this and said, "It's the number of books."
Thank you.
But it's not strange.
(Laughter)
It's a number of two men.
When I realized this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of dollars in Austria?
You need to ask to leave.
In Dinamarca, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word called defeat.
This word is what you're already.
I don't have to do anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to get out.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days.
And here I have two options: one received the recipes.
And another allowed me to receive.
(Audience) Yes.
The recipes were dismartened to the offers and they were dead.
So someone decided I wanted a party and I didn't want to receive, so I went there and went to leave.
I went to get out of the offer and marked the recipe.
Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people.
I opened it.
I was there already marked to get the culprit.
This is the name of going out, if I was really.
Audience: Yes.
I thought it's cool to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take the work they love.
And then, a Uber track tells me a story.
Here's a lady.
Let's choose.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage, man?"
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose the cube."
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, little by little, I chose to be without even knowing.
She chose what she was already chosen for her.
It's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
AC: If we went to the Google today to research today with the media of the person?
There are 5.67,000 results.
What's the kitchen we clip?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and the same was Google?
After that, what I do: I'll read a click in the nurse page.
I love Perfect, I see from there what parents don't, "I'm going to the page."
Just to ask for it.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
AC: These English and English have a name in the behavior economy and its name, they are called "dinities."
It's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to give an information to the person next to you.
AC: Don't think about the fourth.
It's an ecology, you see?
So, this is the "no".
Is there a theory?
He has a book called "The Bridge Teller."
And the concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, in a simple way, to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought, "Where is it?
(Laughter) In this talk, I created a picture, and it's important to see.
AC: You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, Austria and Detina.
AC: Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
(Laughter) This e-mail had a text.
I've written, "Aless instability in a person, you're automatically taking power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life."
(Laughter) "Shut up!"
If you don't want to be an easy idea, you have to stay in this link and ask for it to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
There are more than 400 people written.
There were 13 people who stayed alone.
So, this means that I consume all the decisions of life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, this is an experiment, according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I show the results.
Genome is it that people ask you a fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Doctors.
This can make us manipulate someone.
And my answer is yes.
The danger says that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
As, for example, if you have it, you can use it, you can use it to do how a patient of diabetes comes out at the time and gets even more harmful.
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents like this doll, the same appointment, which makes the medition.
From the brain waves to detect a kitchen to edit an accident.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, I know there's a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016, that made people in the world leave.
144 billion steps.
What do you imagine it was?
Doctors of Pokémon Go.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we're immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual learning.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I thought.
What if we understand better?
And how do these encouragements work?
How do these snows work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We'll be able to build interfaces better.
And we went to lose more consciousness.
To make us make better decisions.
AD: Thank you.
