Have you ever thought about it?
How is the college entrance exam for people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should I have my role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary?
It's a hug for everyone.
People, "How?"
And without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
Why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then?
These things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
Then I did a study.
To understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
So I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times, they bought a clothes,
Two larger numbers.
They took the sewage to make some advertisements.
And that made the fall of the piece lose.
When they lost a lot of time, they lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations.
The conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist.
That was it.
To make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from one, a desfile, with other women without disability.
And I did it, a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort.
I made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and, obviously, I didn't put a scholarship in my back because I didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
And I did this for Carlena.
A blouse that had openings in the shoulders.
with pressure button, to facilitate the time to pass the head.
In fact.
For people who are quadriplegic, ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics, that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with and without disability.
And for pattern?
I made a website.
In ergonomic goods, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status?
Ideal.
It's to think about pieces, an adult style, but with adaptations.
so they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore.
The child's session of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What else?
What excites me from my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there is...
More than 45 million people with some disability.
What does this mean?
More than 23% of the population.
According to the IBGE data in 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking.
They are producing more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Are they ready and stuck?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition?
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
And I took this second place.
"I."
Silvana.
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists.
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out there.
What are the big companies?
Famous and conceived brands that realized the real need of this vestuary.
And they're already launching inclusive collections, like Latin American.
And it's already in your second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And the Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy.
Look at the other.
The world?
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today.
I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this subject.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
My family always came from the rock, I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
The four-year-old child, until adolescence, and goes through adults: "My community, I started to work with trash, and I was designing people, how?
I collected the Nice, knowing how to separate a list of others, so I tried to talk to the children, people recognized me in the community, and I studied only until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege of a school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
And I go to the children I know.
In my community, we have a seed collection when we go to the forest to work with the SAF, we have a plant.
There, that I met a plant called her name of Engar, it's a light plant that we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers fast and soil.
And all the plants I had.
When I went to EMBRAPA, I knew that all plants were used in our community, each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate a forest in myth, so I tried to imitate the forest because there in the arm.
I had a lot.
It's a plague that was giving more plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them, various, there I have the guilt, graviolous, Andiromba, Copaiba, Maru, Guaraná, and everything there is no plague.
There, we eat.
There, everything was natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxin.
"Mom, brave."
And the fruit on the side?
Five comparison of ours: in our community, we work there, everything with organism.
You eat everything natural, don't have toxicity in our communities, (Laughter) "I compare the human being as an animal."
The child compared it and, as you just pay, you talk, it stays listening, and then it's going through other children.
So, I compare the child ... going to deal with the human being ... So this was looking for my knowledge, "My father says this, the first lesson we have to go to the person has to be a patient, we have to show the love, the greatest care for those children, and it's to pay and keep coming to this attention, then he talks to the other animal.
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person who observed my house, was observing my house ...
I saw that my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist there, everything is stupid, so I saw that all this with my work was doing with children, who is the future, and it's OK, and today we have it.
With a job inside, with the long run of the human being.
The atoman skeleton, when I started there, we started in a thousand children, for those who don't know what's far from the other hand, is the Amazon's tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're replicating the river that, before, had a dam in front of us, and this dam, it cried and ended up with the river.
And today we have the "repovuando Vio."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're achieving.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I've always liked the forest.
So I'm going to pass to this person.
Nowadays, when I talk about...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
We breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest is always talking to people educating children.
And, going through other people.
And I have a message to leave a very small phrase here.
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people come and come to the next to us, there we're talking, and I'm very happy.
I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty, absurd, and thank you very much, guys.
I'm gay.
I got married with the name, I had two wonderful children.
They were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
It generates these children, they're very proud.
My family is very grateful, these women who helped us make this dream true and create this family.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the largest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you're here, as we feel.
Like a fear that loses our child.
And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or...
To resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find.
For him, I managed to make a transplant of fear, which is what he needs to be cured.
That's it!
It was very incredible, because all the most schools, and all the most friends, made a very big movement, spreading the press, social networks, all the place, raising people, playing medules, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, first for us, and then for the rest of the world.
The first message.
It was.
That when a child gives you leukemia and tries of life, all or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Moreover, it doesn't really matter, and we learned to be this lesson and it was spreading for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement found a donor.
It was that people saw us as a family.
homosexual, a parental man.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father.
Or a more divorced warrior, or important, I love the family, this union, this is what gives the strength, that gives life, what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that another ancestor happened to us.
With this disease, for the world, "What?"
My blood, my thirsty, we were able to manufacture them: our manufacture.
The blood is only blind.
I'm a human being able to donate for another human, so this secret raised this awareness, we have this ability to donate blood for those who need it, and it's not just that.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating "medula ossea" is each strange as the owner of "medula ossia," the chance of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one.
about 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, it was a very beautiful moment to be able to wait for them to get me so that I can save in my life, and that's what I do."
Or as much as it happens to all of us, I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for this union that we are not feeling, that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that consciousness that we can't all do blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
She slept in Laikom.
It's good for you.
It's enough for you.
This is deafness.
Isn't that?
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
I'm serious.
It was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
I, in gender.
I studied at the University of Damasco.
Today.
I'm a refugee.
Not like that, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
The Arabic is a bit like this.
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
And that's sorry.
Without some moments it's difficult to understand.
OK, I say.
Today.
I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Brochancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of groups, tourists.
That you don't have anything to do like this.
A war chest.
In other words, it was beautiful.
Tranquila.
That's it.
It's easy to live.
The population?
It was from Vinci.
Three million people.
And it keeps!
My family.
Children I knew about this child.
Three fingers of clothes.
Have a writer of Engineering.
Two apartments.
I have a car.
In Damasco.
I liked traveling.
And she loved it.
To know the world.
Great!
For countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started.
March 15.
It's 2011.
Interal.
Then.
I get to all the other cities of the country.
My city of Marco.
It was the safer one in Syria.
I had a job, a winner.
25 bombs.
Hello.
What a good thing!
And five years of war.
My country is this.
It's destroyed.
Guys, those who know me were forced to carry or fit their children.
They found their wives.
Very and mutilated by a bomb.
His relatives, his mirror.
And they didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again.
Or not?
Today.
Millions of Syrian will drink everything.
They were dead or they were fleeing in other countries.
My family and I were very sad when we had to leave Syria.
Today, noise, relatives, and our life will be back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
To protect my family.
I went to Bahirut.
Then, ten months.
It's obvious that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So, I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo was the best city.
To go to Brazil.
Why? Because we don't know
There were more opportunities.
And you, Pinas.
Or a week to blame back.
I've been living for 40 years.
And start again.
In Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two daughters, 11 years old, and it was like this: today, I have a Brazilian daughter.
Zara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well, the food my wife did was to take advantage of the kitchen.
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created "Dagina no Facebook" or "Talada comida Syria," that's why now.
Everything has a pen and paper, but the number... (Laughter) I'm there to tell me, "Yes."
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world ...
It was closed, Branuz.
Etrest, who, on the end of the war and of tourist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says, "I, after it happened in France?"
Now, and I don't want to talk about it, or contact with a human person.
Let's think!
That Oislam likes blood.
It's allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly.
Oopsus.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also Branuz or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of Islam.
A basis religion.
Or Alcurão?
I'm not a sacred book since kills a person who kills all men and who read their lives, it's as if life kills all men in Kurón, "Sure your mother, see Polo, 32."
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me.
That we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, no one.
Children of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even with the differences of culture and religion.
When I saw a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, was my wife.
They ask questions, how?
Why do you use this silence with this heat, do you use this lesson at home too?
Aline desirai Jabi.
Today, they lift other rules.
Men and women can't play, embrace, embrace, executive, of voice, of marriage.
Some people wish me.
But I've already seen the humans who do all this.
Kebeijam is the hug.
Beijanzó, Tao island, those rules, more each person wants to eat, or not.
Deblata also brings some things to be the same way they have to be, that they don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Oh, it's PCSO.
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because those things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, even though I didn't know Mozla ... later.
That agency explains, people always understand.
It's risky.
The "Hama Des," that we should respect all religions.
That all people have the same value.
What should we have?
Beautiful.
With all.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians.
Or islon Tabéndez that we have to help the people who need.
Every year we have Elsaacá and we give 2,5 percent.
From all our money to people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor people are Muslims, crystals or Jews.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis.
Now, my dream.
Here in Brazil.
And that the world knows the best Islam.
To conclude with "O" or "brecocent."
Ah, yes.
My children.
They are their children.
"Wow, power, grow."
Together, based.
What is the molecule?
I'm in the small stories of life.
I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of the Center Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always ready to not give up the love of those who always wait for cancer.
Those who always believe in it, don't even believe, soon because of hope, but in the daily lap, I know who suffers, the label makes food, my salary ends, just like this race.
Studying a girl was what they told me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand.
Opportunity of service had a lot of hands.
Cozinheiro.
It's fascinating.
Why didn't I hire myself in the mall, I don't understand this, if you put me so much to pay a secret course, but if you want to enter the office?
Opa, sorry, I committed an event, yes, to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months go, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation.
The EME is to be the domestic, if it were for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please, give me an opportunity.
And the lunch said to me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn the left, enter that little corner that the vastor is overwhelming, be welcome.
Well, this poetry wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, this year, she still wasn't programmed, I was at home, from the page, "I'm a maid, I'm going to talk about the holidays."
I due to the daily race, sometimes we don't even have time to think and see everything we've achieved in life, so I got there one day, in the middle of my life.
And I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a domestic employee, and how do I use Facebook, how do I use it?
I put everything that happens, my mother even picks me with me, "Menine, all of you can do is tomorrow, my new day, and then I decided to share the things that came to me in my mind, because I was a domestic employee for seven years, and then I decided to share the things that came to my mind in less than 24 hours and this became very rare.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos, in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook, and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I did.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at her house and not the bathroom.
In her house.
There was the bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
I spent nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
This was a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compassionate.
This first story on the Internet became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last history and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to various media, both international media and national media.
BBC of London, TV Dábio aleman and several hours.
What I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them moved a lot when I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
And then, they managed to compose themselves, and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
The most valued domestications earn.
I also receive in my page several abusive announces, for example, an announcement I read.
It was for worker, and to work for a second.
"Thank you."
From 8 am.
And then I was very excited to see so many books, and I've always liked to read, but, after 17 years, books, until nowadays, are very expensive, there are domestic, spending for these conditions, even today, winning 380 Brazilian reais, and suffering all that I always did, and seeing my surprise, the Regina enters in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing about the experiences I had already spent in the past, and then she started to indicate several texts, in 2009 when I entered the university, I said, "What am I doing, I said, I started to take a little and I saw there was a book, and I was very difficult."
To help the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and many class friends, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," I wasn't the first one in Brazil, a woman called Lao delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first Sindicato of the Domestics, and it was known by the media of the time as "Terroz" - all this, today, I came here to generate uncomfortable.
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot.
"Why?"
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is black too, here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother.
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I also went to Mexico, because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with a good appearance photo, would never be ready.
When I understood this, and I started to deliver curriculum without photos, they called me at least a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of seeing this internship, that, and so on, "Are you really?"
"Yes."
Hi, I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are logical apartments in the past, and it's the past not so far away, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today, modern senzala.
It's almost the case of employee.
She came running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for her to get there, and when I get there, I was already with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, and then she arrives and says, "Hey, Mina, it was so boring, because I've been waiting for a long time for her to get to get there, you've been opening the door, "Wow, my pattern has come."
My girl, I grew up since I was a little girl, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered, I was there, I only wanted to see her married, just that, but, unfortunately, she didn't invite me a sadness.
Because Christmas, and I'm not with my family, because the modern senzala is his kitchen, he's going to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to the wife who's going to work, and then the only solution is when my pattern will work.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can flee from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, you won 1800 Brazilian reais a month, you'll never win this value in another place."
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service.
I brought my little potato of sorvete, it's my penic, and then I was there, in the service room, appealed my little potato to use the bathroom, and it started to cry, and she said, "Why are you using the little pot?"
It's the kitchen of the employee, "Today I'm here."
Unlike statistics, for some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in domestic, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being welcome, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause)
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripherit and rhythm.
(Applause) Later on, there are 6 million domestic illnesses.
"What should be here on my side?"
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, because in other countries, many domestic patterns, if each one has this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we will decrease a little bit of the disguise in this country, so I'm here with private property, and I'm not talking to six million domestic people.
Sound African roots, unforgetted.
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, first to disconnect.
Sleigh your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Because I'm dying of fear.
If you keep photographing my fear, I'll still be uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself.
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago?
I was deceived in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing the 8th, the conceptive energy of my eyes.
In the stage, I was very inflamed.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling very painful.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "This is it.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Go to the stage.
It opens the word.
I have your eyes.
And that's the safe, the equipment.
Spoint the inflammation points.
The first past to dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author, he said this.
Silence is the entrance door to the state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside.
This feeling, this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
You don't have credits, no sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
It's not in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know that I lived a lot of me.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of history.
From everything I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
That's it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
To determine my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you?
Just keep yours.
Several of you.
Think about it.
"No, I need it."
Others justified their importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
They hear me.
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
You read.
Come this space.
It's not to get rid of you, it's to slow down.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put your bags on the floor, put your cell phones on the floor ... (Laughter) Put your bags on the floor.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed.
You're not disconnected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Sternal collection.
Who connects to the human being?
"And now?"
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back, look at me.
Look.
Propal.
And then, look at the other human being that you have the right and the left.
"Look at her face in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss."
AC: He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Keep it.
Did you see?
Audience: Yes.
Listen ... (Expiration) close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, let your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have.
A moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
"Are you afraid?"
Anyway, it's not this guy in front of me, even because this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
In the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have the strong direction sense, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took your hand to the fifth?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicago's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with a connected vocalization system.
And feeling where are you?
Observe.
And apply the space location system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What does the area take care of?
Open your eyes.
Strange.
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
It's new, it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
Then you realize it.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
A habit in our lives is self-knowledge technologies.
In the planet, along with our aggressive process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available.
They're simple.
But they are digital technology.
Great generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity, silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
That's why I had the first video.
I had a demand of a legion of fake ideas that asked for society.
Books, colleagues, school and family.
Once there are only one.
At least, it has an influence in the same time.
How does it work like that?
The translator thought.
of hope for millions of Brazilians.
10% of them are Brazilians.
16 and young people.
And almost always 6,000 feet translations.
These fears and events like these here.
But as to allow people with hearing impairment, they can do it.
But it was in Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
Look after being lost at the same time and, in the same time, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially?
Unfortunately, that's the "e" we can translate as entertainment, subjects like technology from TED.
And you leave?
The ones that come from the accident or the political, business, entrepreneurship, even literature.
Let's talk about the forms of science.
The theme is this inventive event.
It's that there's a curriculum that we have after all, not only.
It also reduces.
I said, "My God, I'm 21."
It's translating, thinking and transcribing as a hole.
Talents in the TEDx environment.
And it can be.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator.
It's a privileged reader.
Not only wanting to do that day and bring it back.
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting here at this event.
Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence.
In these actions, how is it?
And to become something that is empowered, that I don't have any doubt and education.
And I also didn't have doubts, I wanted to study.
And when is the fish and the volunteer work?
Because if I don't choose my own, it's my decision.
And try to commit myself.
Do you have the time that opens?
It's different from the air.
And it's called "Fones," a story of extinct.
A dream of knowledge has investment.
A lot of research.
Many jobs have changed their research.
And for us, a translation like this, fluent, pleasant, too.
The best thing we do, he can always do in the best.
Because the text can be a million people.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, by the way, the majority.
Or how we call it "DC."
In the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is a Portuguese, which is very different, we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
Very well ... (Audience) Hi!
I have to hear it.
What a living on the air?
A deep, political crisis, right?
My father, who today was 22 years old, got hurt for primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four concerns in mathematics very well, and the dream of them was always power.
And to make some children get up, that's why the one who lived our little girl from our girls called Taiobeiras.
In some sides, my father filled me with his beginning, his logic, his finger, and his seat.
If you knew, as a commercial, they had a small hat from a presence store, they had a big deal.
It's in 1960.
He was literally, without anything, because you kill yourself in the cells.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his failure with the name of my father decided.
My mother, who I've got a few years old, is my help, right?
It was not knowing about cooking.
My mother's wedding supported me to do tickets to sell.
What was it that really internally?
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and my mother were that we, auditors, to study.
And this is how it works.
A big fact, without a doubt, because it's already condemned to the penalty of national research for anxieties, homicides.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared.
And a body in the country, in the middle of the day, he got a priest, the little visite that appeared at home.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get married.
Without knowing, he was training.
The smaller conditions of what we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my life, in my opinion, are my only children, Daniel, Nik, the ones I've never put these coworkers for me, but for whom I did?
It's a adventure that was always a pleasure for me.
Coincident who coincidence or not?
Four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is a group of a series, at some point in life, and one of my brothers is also fantastic, creative, revolutionary, that applies.
So the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do it.
We see in our country the education has to be a priority inside.
And my passion for initiatives is TEDx?
And I said, "Yes."
I'm doing that TEDx, just like my father, was such a simple management in the United States.
The TEDx inspires us.
What makes us believe?
Think of everything.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us letters, numbers, and symbols, and so they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when I returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I stopped buying a rule.
It's a little girl who allows me to write in Braille.
In the jungle, you write that you show the release.
I ended up in my notebook.
And my agenda?
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me.
While I wrote her that I was learning, she gave tips, and with that, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Crown School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what we taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet and be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But saw that there was no Internet, we decided that it was our own, we started researching, learning about robotics and programming with our teachers.
And try to create a clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock and showed it to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others, from what she taught us, and encouraged us a lot to continue this project, to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from our interest could help in our aunt and potentially many other people.
And this has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, we were teenagers, we managed to create something innovative, and there's still a lot to be done to help.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent way, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people, they can live in a manual.
Thank you.
OK, we're all in agreement: two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is a expression I've made, the only difference or the main difference with sexual relationships that dance crucial is that there's a change, that is, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And another part, with an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it, and I know some hundreds, men and women who manage their business in autonomous way, publish their announces, receive their clients in apartments, in horthes, or even street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve this.
Children?
Excats that involve less than 16 years or adults who aren't aware of what their consent is a crime case, are cases that must be followed criminally and judicially and the delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
In sexual aggression of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults, which is forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent for volunteer and forced institution.
I'm also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations.
The trend is the confuse for the situation against sexual exploration.
In other words, taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traits, the phenomenon of traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic trafficking.
Human.
Almost all of them for free exploration, victims for sexual duration.
It's only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify an judicial action.
(Laughter) What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disconnected from reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
But often people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
Some defenses, structured, and there's something that expects someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype, most people in prostitution don't consider the victim?
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
Because not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people to immigrate economical inequalities, social and cultural inequality, we know there is a diversity of constraints that differentiates the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, when I find a researcher interviewing conversations, I'm with people who do sexual work, what they say is that they're an option, with a standard option after disadvantage and disadvantage activity, but that is highly destroyed and not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who posts.
Think about it.
I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely in the laboratory and that, of course, has someone to explore it.
But this is only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are sexual work.
There's a diversity of people.
Deperactics?
Of the experiences, not all people have positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many women of sex work, for example, when our image is equipped with when we think about prostitution from.
Does anyone in the street?
And I say that the studies that are made fuel.
And the Western cities.
They try to estimate the number of people who are in this century.
Plete Saint-Drois.
What will it represent only 20% of us?
It's total of people depositing.
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
(Laughter) They are less, they are minority, but they are not negligentable.
I'm going to give you the data of the study that was done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the person in Dias, from the University of Lisboa, and that interviewed 140 workers of sex, both in the context of Rua, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.
And now, 7.8% of women drive, and there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
(Laughter)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, the dismantle.
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceives that it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
(Laughter) In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not forbidden to sell sex, but it's crime.
To buy sex, the idea that is at the base of this law is that people who are in the situation are victims without exception and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor and the client, and so we will criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has spoken about the great success of this law and how it decreases prostitution.
In other words, the stigma and the disease.
(Audience) Yes!
Another idea we have is that all the people who are sexual work are.
These are victims ... Hmm!
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea that the client has a criminality.
It's a idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that relationships between us.
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships, but there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of criminalizing clients, is dehuman.
Because they are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through sex professionals.
Sexuality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexual security, and now that it destroys any argument that tries this example, it's quite clear about sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and its pleasure, and many of them are able to make clients decrease.
So, if people can do this as an option?
Thank you.
If people think that for them it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can do everything.
He found the work conditions.
If this can be done.
Without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmas so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
The cause of moral.
And specifically moral?
Sexual, which divides sexuality in two types, on the one hand, has a sexuality and considered legitimate.
"Normal and natural."
And we have a sexuality considered illegitimate.
It's normal, anti-natural, and that's where the sex begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of the description of people who do this activity: stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many brain discriminations, for example.
(Laughter) When they drive in institutions in the area of action, justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, I'm not sure that I don't know if you've ever used this word, not TEDxBas, "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
In other words, the stigma of puta divide women in two types: tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense?
The stigma of puta is a tool that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that is divided, normally restricted, it's the service of the sexuality of feminine, it's a kind of duty.
Any woman knows how to seize the risk to be called puta.
But let's go!
Why do I think we can do any one, we can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of basic policies based on scientific evidence, which has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
(Sigh) And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option, to challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to see silencing throughout time, sex workers, so for everyone, organized by 70s, but precisely because of stigma, their voice doesn't have creativity, they are not heard, we don't need rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
(Laughter) After all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it's useful?
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex workers.
Thank you.
This understanding that, at the beginning of the university at the beginning of the world, in the last 10 years, the simplification of a path that I've discovered here, when we've been there, at the beginning of a technical judgment, that we've been there, but, in the last 10 years, this relationship to someone who understands the suffering of that individual, which has a lot of life, that has a passion, that has to have a technical reaction, the best treatment for us, the best treatment for you, that is also, the best treatment, a doctor's, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor's, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, a doctor, and a lot of money, a lot of money, a lot of money, a lot of money.
Someone, when we were wrong, that we got someone who had a brilliant stadium with the same research, cure, poetic, and we delivered someone technical, who knows a lot of medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
(Laughter) So, why is it that the church considered, instead of finishing my father's parents in medicine, that's the pop, it was uncovered and created a method that, until today, is used in the massive formature, in medicine, in the world?
It was done in a state of fifteen years of Christ, in two words.
You're talking about the complex media, and you're three words here.
In all the houses that entered, I just spoke about the benefit of the sick people, especially the seduction of women, of men, of the children and of the brains.
That's why they saw the respectant life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
If I respected this judgment and didn't hear it, it would be the tip of enjoyment of reputation between men in all times, that the transgender gave me the violin that happens to me.
Why, already at that time, if I'd take care of this, and still today you do a journey?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe, because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good care, so today, few things are registered by 1's judgment.
And, in this case, I saw a gold participated in a protest that is registered for a geography.
So today, a patient has a medical knowledge that takes care of this group, and each one is taking care of a little bit of this, with this, we're specializing a lot in cure of disease and we're losing the cure of the patient.
There's a current theory that says, "Sami can talk about the patient, it can't.
But I was in a class in college, in a small groups, as a teacher, and I tricked with you to be like this: "Look, patients, there's thomography, resonance, enthusiasm, and mutation."
I put my hand in their belly, I couldn't take care of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
Everyone calls me, calls me the whole class and says, "Let's see the whole network and make science."
And he looked at uncertainty, as I see, the people didn't smoke anymore, Buraco Duzunk, to show that the magician movies, "You're mapping, it's crazy, you can talk a lot about it, now that you're leaving a patient, you're a moment of intimacy, you're able to remember something that doesn't take us."
In addition, as you see, the patient.
"You're here to answer you, the vulnerable area, you're telling you to deal with it."
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good there, that you're experiencing it, leave the care of you.
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to say "selfie," but it's replicated in science.
We don't know why it appears, there's no operation in exams, there's no external interactions, there's no rays, it doesn't work anymore, every time more, the number of diseases work, the diseases have a symptom.
What happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you may raise your hand and say, "Well, it's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship.
But being a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are talking to me.
What you're going to talk about for a meter group, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two there.
In the doctors, there are two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our curve process.
The first point, the most important thing, is to inform yourself.
Where was the student talking about Doctor Google, who was fashionable, when I was a child, there were some pupils, and there was a book read by health, that didn't exist without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, for you to convince someone to publish something, because it's a editor, you have to have a lot of information, a lot of good and very important information, but, in many data, many, many of us need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's bigger than the proper information.
So, the action really hurts.
I have a blog.
(Laughter) In my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they allow me for anything, that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests and money or gaming.
So, it's natural.
Second very important thing: you don't believe in good things, you're delighted, "Look, medicine has changed, now your problems have finished seriously."
Differently, a lab with a scientist will have an immediate discovery without the scientific society doesn't kill this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone, so there's no thing that's discovered today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid thing, like the industry, there's no interest that you're taking away, you shake, nobody dominates information, it's hard to have some other interesting interests behind, so these things don't believe me.
And for a long time.
Take the solution, discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information, information, knowledge, catch information, participatively from your cure, but disculp your doctor.
Secondly, it's very important to be active, related to the appropriate action.
It's asking, demanding, knowing.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know what the cubic hospital is, the guy has no time to answer me, "I work 20 years later."
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture to exist, it's not to get there fighting with everyone in the teacher, it's not this, it's slowly to know.
There is, if composing with time, we'll go.
And to make the atendments be different.
The method they want, they want to have the right.
They don't want to have this attempt, or at the same time, they want to have it with chaos.
Audience: Yes.
Once, I was in the Amazon, on the internet, near Venezuela, she appeared great, and it was human, and we had a patient there, that had cancer and think, "That's a human thing."
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his daughter's scene, and, for me, the Indian was a doctor, a boy who spoke very little about Portuguese, who obviously didn't talk about Germany, he was really comfortable, and, after all the years, I had the opportunity to be treated in a soccer team.
(Laughter) What I'm wanting to say is that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
This magic, which is the art of letting go, without speaking the language, without having a completely different culture of the other, has a lot of interest in taking care of others, in this moment we talk about, I have a lot of thought, and there's a doctor, it's a little, a little, a video, a little consultant, a little.
We, doctors, can try to find more unity of our treatment, the risk of doing, because of a connection, go to the best world and you'll be more well treated, and all patients, more compassionate, thank you.
(Laughter) I'd like to tell you a story that changed the digital option of 59 dollars, and the respect of this experiment is that, for this group of people, most of them chose a digital option, two, so that they need to be done in the Western Northern City, which is also necessary for a second group.
I'd like to talk to you about this, because I'd like to ask you a little more about it, and I'd like to study all this, because I've come back to influence people's behavior in a decision, and I'd like to see that they're really powerful, and I'll study cognitive technologies and neuroscience applied to what they're going to be better, and what they're going to be, in the same way, in this moment.
So, from these 35 million decisions that we have, it was at the same time, gathering this concept with the concept of the Revist of Economics, which we've been working on, but it's also a research that has a smartphone, and, in a certain way, that has a lot of technology, and it has a lot of information, that has a lot of view, and it's a lot of decision, if the person has a lot of well-being, and it's a lot of education, and it's a lot of education, and it's a lot of course, and it's a lot of education, and it's a lot of education, and it's a lot of education, and it's a lot, and it's a lot of money, and it's a lot to bringing, and it's a lot of money, and it's a lot of money, and it's a lot of course, and it's a lot of education, it's a lot of course, and it's a lot of course, it's a lot of effort, it's a lot of effort, it'
Are we going to study these universities if we're using digital camera, or that the medication will cost many times not only one of us, or that the path we're going to take will be supposed to start with this illusion as I am, and we put the "wees" and we put the "we."
(Laughter) (Laughter) In this case, it's a number of pain and men, which, in Austria, is 9100 Brazilian reais, (Laughter) in this case, is a number of dollars for the Rio Grande do Sul.
You need to ask to leave, in Dinamarca, you don't need to ask to enter, so there's a magic word called "deflow."
This word is what you're already without doing anything.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento," you need to ask for the following, (Laughter) some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there and go for it.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and then I had two options: one to receive the senses and the other to receive the offer, the recipes was dismartened to the open and was killed.
So someone decided I wanted the party and I didn't want to receive, so I went there and went to leave.
Uber has a new functionality, a Q, you can share the board with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked, and I got a story, and I talked a lot about Uber, I don't know if you take a work to those people, but I talked a lot about Uber's motorcycle, I don't know if you take a Uber, and I thought it was cool to know it.
When the guy arrived, in another person in the car, and he looked strange and said, "There's another passage in the car, he looked at him and said, "Thank you, he chose the cube."
And she said, "Well, that's it.
So, Marxine chose the business without even knowing, (Laughter) she chose what was already chosen by her, it's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are, if we are Google today to research where people eat, there are 57,000 results.
What's a click?
(Laughter) 91% of people explain in the rest of the first page of Google.
And who chose a place we eat from the person was me, was it the same?
After that, what I do, I'll go and click on the website, (Laughter) "I love Perfect," and I see from there what has the page "No, I'll go to the right page."
(Laughter) In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving a few mistakes for us.
These little English and English have a name in the Contramental Economy as well as the name, they are called "the Indians."
(Laughter) It's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy in the person next to you: don't realize what you're doing, it's an ecology, there's a book called "Donante."
And the concept of "digitoland" is the name I gave to a simple way of understanding these empuries in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought there were adults.
(Laughter) And in this talk, I wanted a picture, and it was important to see ... (Laughter)
(Laughter) You're thinking that only those who fall into this were the European Austery of Detina Marca, everyone here received an email of confirmation in TEDx.
(Laughter) When you don't want to be low enough to explain in this link and ask yourself, "How many people who read a book, more than four people you're automatically taking the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life, more than four written people?"
In other words, one of the things I do, I do this experiment to understand how people behave, and I show the results, so this means that I keep building all the decisions of life of 300 and 70 conversations.
Necessity of data.
This can make us manipulate, right?
The danger says that yes, knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do what someone buys, it's something she doesn't need, or you can use for good.
Like, for example, you can use to make a patient from diabetes come out at the time, that is also harmful.
Or can you say?
To avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same appointment, which makes medition.
From the brain waves, we have to detect a kitchen to edit an accident.
So, in these 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016.
People in the world have 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine it was like that?
Pokémon Gogh's budget, (Laughter) because it's a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we're immersed in this world of increased reality, virtual reality, learning machine.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better.
How do these encouragements work?
We'll be able to build a better world, we'll be able to build better interfaces.
And we went to be more aware for us to make better decisions, thank you.
