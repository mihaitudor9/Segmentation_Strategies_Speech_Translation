Have you ever stopped to think?
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference?
Or should it have, my role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People with and without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this.
And why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion work.
And one day ...
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help or be here?
Is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my job about this.
Then I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, took the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made the fall of the piece lose, two greater numbers.
When they lost a lot of time and lost a money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations...
The conclusion I arrived ...
It's that this location was really necessary.
And my purpose as a stylist was this: to make clothes for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I made a pants for her, a pants with high cost, elastic in the belt to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress of the piece's spirit.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no retreat to not form expensive, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface, and obviously I didn't put a bag on my back because it didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with others without disability.
I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders.
With pressure, pressure button, to facilitate the time to go through our heads.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegic, ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disabilities.
And for pattern?
I made a website.
Very ergonomic, I've already done it in the seated position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I made a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, under the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him.
To be able to identify that that piece would be that would use in the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or low status, the ideal is to think about adult style, but with adaptations.
so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes anymore.
The child's nation of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
And it seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and this means...
More than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, like colorful wheels.
Stop prostheses?
More likely and technological materials.
Did you know that it's already in the last edition, that I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
And I took the second place.
What about me?
Silvana ...
The "drika."
And many other people.
Several other stylists ...
Small brands.
They are already adapting pieces in their collections.
But it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, who were already released their second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
For all of us to think about this, we must have empathy.
Look at others.
The world ...
It's changing.
People are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
My family has always come from the rock.
I've always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest?
It was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
The four-year-old child, even adolescence, and goes through an adult.
My community, we started working with the record, and I was designing people.
Putting your teeth, knowing how to separate the other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was winning parents' awareness.
The parents were catching it.
Do you deliver me to the children?
People recognize me in the community.
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate.
But today I feel like an educator.
"Yes."
I do with the children I know.
In my community ...
We have one.
A seed harvest when you go to the forest?
I'm going to work with the SAF.
Do we have a plant?
Hello!
I met a plant called her name of Engar, a light plant.
And we plant everything under it, it's a plant that recovers fast and soil.
And all the quantum plants.
Below, we have a good result.
And our community?
"When did I go to the arm?"
There I met ...
All plants.
It was used each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
(Laughter)
So you have to imitate the forest, because there in the arm.
Do you have a lot?
It's a plague that was giving more account.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
That's it.
So I tried to plant them, various: there I have the guilt, graviolous, Andyroba, Copaiba, with Maru.
It's time to love.
And everything, there, doesn't give money, "Light, eat?"
There, everything is natural, in the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, a lot of toxins.
"Mom, brave."
And the fruit of there, without comparison to ours.
In our communities, we work there everything with organicism.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxin in our communities.
"Me?"
To compare the human being as an animal.
The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children.
The Pope Gai came to this tension, then he talks to the animal quote, so I compare the child like this.
And to deal with your human being?
We have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection, the greatest care for those children.
So, this was looking for my knowledge.
And it was putting everything into this: "My father says this, the first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home from us."
So, I'm a person who's always where I walk, I'm observing.
I'm a person who observed my house.
I was observing my house and ... (Laughter)
I saw that my wife always likes to be everything.
Things don't exist, I said, "All right, bad."
So, I saw that all of this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future?
And it's OK.
And today, we have ...
A work inside costs the gift of the human being.
"Shut up, don't you take it?"
When I started there, we started in a thousand kids, "Why don't you know what's far from the human being?"
It's the Amazon's tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're bragging 25,000 children.
And we're repositing the river that, before, had a dam.
In front of us, it's like this a little bit of our community.
And...
This dam made it and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation that we're getting there.
To live with nature, to understand nature.
And I always liked the forest.
I went through this person.
Nowadays, when I say...
In the forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, right?
We breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest ...
Is it always talking to people educating children?
And ...
I'm going through other people, and I have the message to leave a very small phrase here.
I'm like this.
When I'm in the community, people get closer to us.
Are we talking and competing people?
And I'm very happy.
Isn't it?
(Laughter) I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Little by little, and thank you very much, guys ... (Applause) Thank you very much (Applause) Thank you very much.
(Music) I'm gay, married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
In my family, it's very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream true and create this family.
Two months ago, our son Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most siblings you're here, as we feel, as a fear of losing your child.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find it.
For him, I managed to do a transplant of fear, which is what he needs to be cured.
From that moment on, it was very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement, and all this movement made us think that "Otaancheta," through this disease.
It brought us a very important message for all of us, first for us and then for the rest of the world.
Thank you very much.
The first message.
It was that when a child has leukemia and has a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems, fears, concerns, don't matter.
Moreover, there's no relevance, it really matters, and we learned to be established, and it spreads for our friends, for more school, for society, people in Facebook, talking about truth, it doesn't matter what the problem I had.
The second message that happened with this disease, so public, and all this movement of finding a donor, doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, fight for life, and for love.
It was that people saw us as a homosexual, a parental man.
It's a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
The important thing is that I love the family, this union, this is what gives the strength, or a father alive, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a father who gives life, that's what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that transcribe happened to us with this disease, to the world: "What?"
My blood, my medulated anxiety, we were able to manufacture them: our manufacture.
So Tancrède raised this awareness, so we have this ability to donate blood so that it needs, and it's not just a human being can do for another human.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
And donating "medula ossea" is challenging as a "medula ossia module, the chances of compatibility.
Between a donor and a patient, I, when a scared meat of life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, and it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a mega-senha.
Ah, for me it was a very beautiful moment to be waiting for them to call me so that I can save in my life without any effort, without any animator, I'm donating a part of me to be able to save in my life.
Or supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, not only to save life as credit, but to have that awareness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you (Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
She slept in Alaikon.
It's enough for you.
The base is like you.
This is deafness.
Two here.
My name is Talola El Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Damasco.
The Syrian capital.
In January, I studied at the Damasco University.
Today I'm a refugee, not Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a bit...
(Laughter) Now that's the French of Portuguese.
I'm sorry, without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
"Broancetto," who exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups.
That you don't have anything to do as a slam.
A war chest.
That's how it was beautiful.
Tranquila, cheap, and easy to live.
The population was 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child.
Three flashes of clothes: elector, engineering, two apartments.
I was a car in Damasco and I liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started, March 15, 2011.
And then, all the other cities of the country arrive.
My mask city was the saferest in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs per day.
After five years of war, the country is destroying.
People, who know me, were forced to carry, or each of their children.
They found their fertile voices and mutilated by a bomb, family, they disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work, I went to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian will be stuck, dead or refugee in other countries.
In my family, we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because our relatives and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I live them again.
To protect my family, I went to Barabairote.
After ten months, I knew that Brazil had opened doors for Syrian, so I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city to go to Brazil.
Why did they have more opportunities?
And you saw Pinas, or a week, to knock back.
I was 40 years old in my life.
And start again in Brazil.
I arrived here in December 2013, with my family, two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like this: "A Sara, nine months."
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday, and everyone talked very well, the food my wife did was to take advantage of the very well-known kitchen.
And making food to sell, that's when I created the Facebook Bachina on Facebook, "Hey, Syria, that's why now everything has a channel and paper," (Applause) (Cheers)
I do food and deliver.
Even Boru Whatsapp.
(Laughter)
We are happy in Brazil, we thank the reception of the Brazilian people, you opened the doors when the world was closed.
Etresthe, who, on account of war and terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian.
It's about Islam, today in the morning, here, or a journalist says to me, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a human person."
Let's do it!
That Oislam likes blood.
It's allowed to kill the name of religion, but exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
But it's also good for us, Syrian, or Islamic State is scared that kills a person who had killed all the men and who reads life, it's like the currency of your mother, the school, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill the Muslim and the Sunitar, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between Syrian and Brazilians.
Even like the differences of culture and religion.
When you use your wine, a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covers the hair, like my wife, and my wife ask questions like, "Why do you use this lion at home too?"
In Jabi's land, there are other rules.
Men and women can't touch me, embrace, embrace me, except the voice of wedding, some people tell me, but I've already seen the humans who do all this.
That they see, it's the hug, they see so slam, they have those rules, but each person wants to buy, or not, they also prohibit some things, the same way they have crossed, that they don't obey everything.
It's not good, it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcoholic drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol?"
Oh, it was sex!
Like more than a single man.
This is not happening to me.
(Laughter) Why are those saved things of the slam?
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after we explain to ourselves, people always understand and respect.
The "Mohama Des," that we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value.
That we have to have truth with everyone.
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians or slams that we have to help the people they need.
Every year we have Alsaka and we give 2,5%.
From all our money to the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims, crystals or Jews.
And I invite you to learn more about Islam.
I'm sure it was like to understand that it's a basis religion.
Now, my dream here in Brazil is that the world knows the best Islam.
To conclude with "oprecocient," my children do.
And your children?
Bauder grows together based on the cell phone.
(Applause)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of the Center Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always wait for the reach.
Those who always believe in it, don't believe me, soon because of hope, but in the daily lap, I know who suffers, the label makes food, my salary ends, just like this race, studies the girl, what they said to me.
I studied, but I'm not here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I had a lot.
Cozinheira.
Pascinera, why not hire me in the mall, I don't understand this, if you put me so much to pay a secret course, but if you want to enter the office?
Opa, sorry, as I had an event, to clean everything and wash the bathroom.
The days pass, the months fly, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation: "DEO, ME," is to be the domestic.
If it were for the option, I have many friends who are already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity.
And the lunch said to me.
You follow this corridor, go straight, turn the left, enter that little corner that the vastor is overwhelming, be welcome.
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'm going to tell you why I wrote this poetry: "Today I came to talk about the page success, I've been a maid.
The page I created in Facebook appeared in July 2016 and, as I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was at home of vacation for four months.
Last day by day, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I picked up one day, in the midst of my life, and I was delighted there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live in the south of the beach, almost in front of me, and I decided to share the things that came to my mind when I was a maid for seven years.
And then I warned to Gallerona, personal person, I came to the memory of betting this on Facebook and going to use the website, and the domestic employee, so that, in this case, other people have already gone through this, I'm going to become very fast.
And then, soon after I put my first story, my first story on the Internet, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos, this in 2009 and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I was doing.
In her house?
There was a bathroom for domestics, but there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and this, a person who always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories that I thought would receive only last stories, and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to various media.
So much the international media, the national media, London babies, television and Germany, and many others.
What I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype, that everyone.
All of us.
All of them also moved a lot when I started talking about the most valued domestic situations, they earned for hours, so totally different from our country.
It's a job announcement that I titled "How abusive announces," for example, an announcement I read.
It was for worker, to go to work for the second, to the sixth.
From 8 am, at 18 hours, earning 380 Brazilian reais.
The day, no, week, much less, 300 and 80 Brazilian reais per month, this is our condition here.
There are domestic ones going through these conditions still today, there are domestics that are being prevented from feeding themselves, and they don't earn value to food, there are domestic ones.
Not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities.
And then I was very excited to live so many books and I started to fly, and when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a single house where I found something I call humanized treatment, which is Regina, which I always liked to read, but, even today, costed very expensive, and my mother, my father, my father, my father, I didn't have a lot of time to clean the TV.
(Laughter) And there I was sitting down deliciating myself with those books, and for my surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young, I didn't know anything about life, and, knowing about the experiences I had already spent in the past, I got to read at the university, I said, "Wow, you have to study, I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a teacher, since I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world, and then it was very difficult."
Conciliating the university with the faxines, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the month, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarized some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make tests, which is very difficult to concilate.
It's the studies, and for those who think I was the first to talk about these issues of raising the role of the traditional family in Brazil and showing that slavery hasn't yet ended.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," and people say, "Wow, it's very heavy, today I came here to generate discomfort."
Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
The great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any, yes, 53% of the population is black too, right?
I'm here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited for black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother ...
It was domestic.
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I arrived to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
Because I was without understanding, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil.
I would also pass.
Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver with rhythms without photos, they called me at least one interview.
This, after graduated, took suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this, that and so on.
"And then, are you?"
Yes, or I'm magic ... (Laughter) (Applause)
And I always say what was the big house in the past.
These are the illustrative apartments today.
What the domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distance, it's very close to us.
They are domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's almost the case of employee.
Audience: Yes!
She came running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for a long time for her to arrive, "You're on the beach day, I hear her entering the car, the baruline of the key opening the door, "Wow, my pattern came."
And when I get there?
She's already with a clothes away, just waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take her money, according to her wife, it's the little box of the employee."
My girl, I created it since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother always went to work, I didn't have much time for her, it's the little box of the employee, it's Christmas, I'm seeing my family of my dressing potatoes, everyone happy.
I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family, because modern senzala is the little box of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work, it will work, it takes his wife to work.
Tell it to his wife who's going to work, but he returns.
For the house, to wake up, and the only solution I had was to take part in all the comforts.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I get stuck, and so I can flee from his seeds.
Because when I say I'm going to change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,700 Brazilian reais a month."
I'll never win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children on a northeast, and they need this money, because modern senzala ...
It's the little box of the employee, I just got to the new service.
I brought my little potato of sovet, because my little potato of sovet is my Pinico, and then I was there, in the service room, pressed my little pot of sovet and made this number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the sunlight and use the bathroom, and I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee for that I brought little?"
What is modern senzala?
It's the little box of the employee.
Today I'm here.
Because when I told my pattern that I would find statistics to some people, in my place, would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are, for this attention, your grandmother wasn't domestic, your mother was also in the owner, is already predicted for your family to be seen."
So you have to be happy, being seen, so I'm here in the statistics: black woman, fat ... (Applause) (Cheers) Happy and peripheric.
Women press, fat.
Professor.
Peripérica and Heck.
Oh, my side!
I'm not here today.
Later on, there are 6 million domestic women.
"What should I be here on my side?"
And that at some point they will be, "What can I do?"
The race that my life isn't thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one gives this idea of talking and humanizing relationships.
We decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, this job of domestic people is in this country, so I'm here in the statistics, "I'm not doing it, I'm talking to six million domestic people."
(Applause)
I'm from African Axias and not forced.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
I'm here today to talk.
about yourself.
Silence.
And it's already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you.
For the first time in my talk, it was to disconnect.
Leave your cell phones.
Don't photograph.
Until I was dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Who says that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally?
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself ...
Look at yourself in the silence of your head.
You will never know who you are.
Four years ago ...
I was deceived in a table, in a surgical center.
And then?
I was doing eight conceptive surgeries in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did he already start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't take.
Let's do it?
And I had it.
At almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Go to the stage.
Open the word.
I have your eye.
It's safe, with equipment.
Put the inflammation points.
The first past to destroy.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next book, and I was sure I wasn't against it.
And then, in the middle of this ...
From this chaos of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "Yes."
Silence is the entrance door for a state of presence.
Of course I remembered that.
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
Inside it.
From this feeling, of this moment of presence?
It's the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already lived.
And you're not the anxious antecious participation you have in front of you.
Human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race.
There's no credit, no sex.
You're a human being.
It's time I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
It's much less.
It was very angry.
You can't be in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know they lived a lot of me.
They were the consequence of history.
Of all I had already lived.
And then?
The discovery was.
Everything I had already lived.
I loved it.
Determinating the way I thought, the way I act.
I was determining the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Do you remember?
Most of you?
She only stood her egg.
Several of you.
Think about it.
No, I don't need it.
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, because all of you have it.
"My ears."
All of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
"Deslige."
Come this space.
It's not about getting rid of you, it's delighted.
Disconnected from cell phones.
(Laughter) Put them on the floor, put their cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
That's it.
And then?
You go back, close the computer.
That's what the legs close to them.
And you, who were putting our notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With everything closed.
You are not connected.
You took close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection.
Who connects themselves is the human being?
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling.
Look back to me.
Look.
Propal.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"No, I'm going to look at her in this way."
You're fine, you won even a little kiss ... (Laughter)
He was connected, guys.
Let's see.
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
Did you see?
(Pre-recorded voice) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands, close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are you really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born.
It's fear.
It's a bit scary.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of you.
Until this moment, with much more fear than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Do you look closed?
Come this space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember the ceiling?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre.
In the south of Brazil.
In Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
The strong direction sense exists a knowledge.
You know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At that moment, a different piece.
Surely, you're sitting down.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Where are you?
Feel the chair.
Do you remember when you were children, you took a hand to Chica Quente?
And soon you learned that a little before the hand touching Chica.
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the localization system connected.
And feeling where are you?
Observe yourself.
And apply the space localization system.
To your minimum space.
The volume?
The area.
That you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
Open your eyes.
It's strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
How is it new?
Equality is new, as it's new, inclusion, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence?
Then you realize it.
That much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become...
A habit in our lives?
These are self-knowledge technologies that are there.
In the planet, along with our evolutionary process, there are more than 10,000 years.
All of them.
Are they available?
They're simple.
But they are technology of...
A lot more generation.
We already know.
That in the future it gives the evolution of the race.
Communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid.
I decided to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity, silence is a source of freedom.
Idexte.
(Applause)
Who has never fallen in a TED talk, who has had the first video, (Laughter) and, normally, it's the first view.
As it was my case.
I can say that it's an absurd evaluation of the speaker.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of an angle of fans and ideas.
That they understood to translate, in a shared way, with their friends, their friends, their family.
In the case of Brazil, the work of translation is fundamental, once only 5% of people according to public transportation.
And, at least, it has an influence in English.
As the producer knows, the translator can see a poor in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
10% of them are Brazilians.
It was translated to 116 languages.
And almost always 6,000 translations made until the world.
But we're only translated as we also transcribe the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx around the world.
But compare to allow people with hearing impairment.
I manage to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, in my case, I wanted to read in Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be fertilized for me instead and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more languages.
Initially, TED, with its own looptype, indicates, abandoned subjects with technology from TED, entertainment, which is the "e" we can reduce as a dimension.
And I designed the people to refer to it.
Nowadays, talks add an inferiority of subjects that will have disappointment or political, businesses, entrepreneurship.
Until literature.
We have, for example.
Let's talk about the forms of science.
Another of my passions.
This year, what defines the subject is this auditory accident.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest expectation of life.
Like also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do of my hearing partner ...
It's possible to think and see how a bubble works.
Talents in an environment on the roof.
And they can be the "self-prox" for these TEDx rocks, or the TV series are short educational videos, accessible to children.
Very small.
I do this not only because translating is a passion and passion is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks is to be a TEDx, but to be a trox, you'll have it.
Not only because I learn a lot with them, and here I remember what translator ...
It's a privileged reader.
Not only because it helps me deal with my age, because I'm a very anxious person.
Don't only want it to be an old man.
Sometimes, if I say that I translate only more than half an hour and hours a day, two or three hours pass by, this happens with me and with the translators.
Audience: Yes!
Not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting to know here in this event.
I'm a researcher.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing accident.
(End of video) In initiatives like this, that TEDx.
(Applause)
(Applause) The second philosophical is the cold.
I opened the propulsion of man in life.
Audience: Yes!
It gives light to this fear and become what is empowerment, that I don't have a doubt of education.
It's fundamental for that.
And there's also no doubt that education is fundamental for people, less privileged, with good crime, or excluded to our society.
They can integrate themselves in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's the work of donation, whether I donate your time, whether I judge your knowledge.
Can you help an object?
Just because your volunteer work receives my choice, a mine decision.
I have to do the best way possible.
And try to commit myself.
To donate the time that a shadow is different from donating the pieces of our time.
The tradition of complex activity that demands not only to know the foreign language, but mainly.
Our language.
And John Fomes, who is a youngest man, portraits of a perfect translation, always has a well-known knowledge.
A lot of research, a lot of work, many research hours.
And for us, a fluent translation to be a scholarship, there's always a degree that I've tasted.
And frustrated with the facts what?
The best thing that makes us, he can always do better.
Because the text can be improved almost undefinitely.
And here I need to remember that the majority of our volunteers is not professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
But, despite this, we create for the quality of our translators, not only regarding the speaker, but in respect to those who invest it, OK?
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers, so they finally be approved by a coordinator or a coal coordinator.
Or as we call it "DC."
In Brazil's case of the Brazilian Portuguese, which is Juncia Portuguese, Portugal, which is very different.
We have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories, we have the IBM, we have Maricene.
Claudia.
And me?
I have our parents.
And it's because of my nose, Gustavo.
October or luck, and Rafael ...
(Sounds)
Audience: Yes!
(Audience) Yes.
(Applause)
Also ... (Laughter) This obsession I got for education?
Actually, she has to do not only with Brazil.
That lives a deep, political crisis, that education is delighted to the bread's cycle, but without even having my own personal story.
(Laughter) My father, who today was two years old, got hurt primary course.
Despite that, he knew how to shake very well and make the rooms and mathematics very well.
And the dream of this was to always be able to study the language I've studied.
And making my children study, that's why the gay who lived in our neighbor's neighbor called "Tai obeyers."
He decided to change his four children at the time, I'll go very fast, the biggest city we live in.
In some sides, my father had sold his beginning his logic to the Uber, and his sixth.
Knowing that, also, as a commercial, they had a small hat from a presence store, they had a big deal.
However, in 1964, as a great version of Brazil, due to this reception, and other reasons, my father was the lack and lost absolutely everything, he was, literally, without anything, because the Senado didn't be one of the greatest brains.
(Background music) Many felt humiliated by their economic failure, my father decided.
And then, for free clowns.
According to Belo Horizons, it's ahead or back, like well liked to go.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who today has a few years old, is my sister?
On the other hand, they wait for the Paralympic Games to go to the bus station.
It was an exhibition of training for my life, and she decided to do "condicks" to sell.
So, for many years in my house, "Poor de queijo," it was literally "canio Paulo," "Give this disguise to the best peoples in the horizon."
(Audience) Yes!
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father didn't mature his hand.
It's that we're at studying.
Audience: Yes!
And that's how it was done: a big fact without a doubt, because it has already been condemned to the advertising of national research for samples and homicides.
In the 48-year-old bills, at 60 years old in Brazil?
Only 32% of people have greater personality than me.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion for my father came to education?
Transparency?
In the worst days, my father, for example, had the habit of putting me.
From standing.
When I was seven years old, at that time, we would take the college entrance exams.
He put me and thought, "I've changed my job for him, and for any visit to appear without houses."
(Laughter) Then I'm entering the words, "You can imagine, right?"
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get there shaking.
Without knowing, he was living in a little like this talk here.
Let's see.
I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we managed more than that today, we managed to give our children.
Even better conditions than those like us had, right?
And here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life, in my opinion, many are my beloved dreams, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul.
The parents, I doubt, put this as a chair to have the newspaper for me.
But for whom I asked all the nights.
From the stories of the audience?
A adventure was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincidently, regarding not, four of us, my brothers, became teachers.
Education is being a group in an accident.
At some point in life.
And one of my brothers is the educator of this image, for me, fantastic, creative, and revolutionary, that applies in education of the students their own school.
So the only message I can leave here today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite the limited conditions, despite the discovery of our country.
Education has to be a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives on the TEDx has to have precisely the fact that the TEDx, just like my father was such a simple way, inspired us.
Just like today, inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us.
To spread ideas.
That make us believe that, despite all.
We can.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where I can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how it worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols.
So he taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated.
ethics is forgotten for a while.
But when they returned to classes, I started to be surrounded, in some classes, and I decided to go back to the arm.
I started writing the letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many, many times.
And I decided to buy a rule, which is a little girl who allows us to write in Braille, where you can, in the cause, write that shows the release.
I ended up full of my notebook.
And my agenda ...
From music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that affected me.
While I wrote her that I was learning, I didn't give tips.
And with this, in the passing of the first second year.
We discovered that we could participate in a "maker" course in the "Croz School."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where we could feel the time.
We started to research, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we would take one on the Internet and be ready to connect with the engines, and then we would have a clock.
But saw that there was no Internet, we decided it was our own.
We started researching, learning about robotics and programming, our teachers.
And try to set up the clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to be able to feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake up and nothing happened, but we rewarded everything, disconnected everything, and started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we ended the clock, and we showed the project, we tried to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille, it was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests.
And use them to change this world.
Suddenly, we saw that it was something that was born from our interest.
I could help, in the kitchen, and potentially many other people.
This showed us how necessary it was to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the feet.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't ended.
The high school, we're second and we're teenagers, we managed to create something innovative.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
(Applause)
Let me ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are aggressive people.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
(Applause) Put your handkerchief.
That's it.
OK, we're all in agreement.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent way.
They can have sexual relationships.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that are commercial.
It's a mountain exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
And the other part is an objective.
It's about getting pleasure.
There are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women.
That they generate their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients.
in apartments, hotels, or even street pensions.
And that they don't have anyone to explore them.
It's about what I'm here to talk about and I'm not going to talk about cases that involve.
Children?
Or adults that are correct.
Scasses that involve us 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases.
These are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially, and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
in sexual version of children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, I also think it's a criminal case, and, therefore, this inherent volunteer institution and forced constitution.
We're also not going to talk about sexual traffic situations.
The tendency is to confuse prostitution against sexual exploration.
But taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part, as if it were all.
In other words, research has shown that Portugal, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is few possible, in fact, it's phenomena that our identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I just told you, Campo de Calfenomenon, is not possible, I'm going to give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic tracks.
Human.
Almost all of them for plural exploration, victims for sexual duration.
Only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim.
To justify a judicial act.
What doesn't justify is that it's all a discourse and a half disconnected from reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
But sometimes people take all the people who are in prostitution.
Like victims.
A lot of ugly.
Sturated.
And there's something waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't correspond to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course we know.
I also have all the people, the same options.
In other words, the world is extremely unfair to structural constraints, like gender inequalities.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
There are economical inequalities, social and cultural inequalities, we know there is a diversity of constraints.
Here, "Flaancing" is made of decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when the investigator enters interviews, I talk to people who do sexual work, what they say is that they will be an option.
It's a pondrated option, after educating the advantages and disadvantage, which is to enter an activity that is profitable, but that is highly destined to disagree and it's not recognized.
(Audience) Yes!
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
(Laughter) In mind, when they think of a person who prostitute themselves.
Think about it.
Okay, and I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one.
Or, as a woman from Malaspet and Ministry, who is in a corner, in a dark street of the city.
And it's very likely to be a sticker and, of course, there's someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor.
The reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sexual work.
Is there a diversity of people?
Deperactics?
Of the experiences, not all the people with positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women foreign, they are not just women driving, there are also many women foreign in sexual work.
For example, when our image would be equipped with us, we thought about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
I say that the studies that are made substance.
And the Western cities.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century, tell us that...
Please stand up.
Because it will only represent 20% of us.
The total of people deposit themselves.
And when we think about women?
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
They're minority, but they're not licensed.
I'm going to give you the data of the study done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker, a study led by the teacher in Dias, from Lisboa University.
And who interviewed 140 sec workers, both in the street context, as in the countryside context, men, women, trans people.
And that, in all the country, found 10.2 percent men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts this percentage will be even more elevated, so when the speech does.
And about the victim of a man or a teacher, forget that it's a percentage of men who are there.
In sexual work.
(Laughter)
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, medicine.
And that...
Although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed at the bottom of perceived by very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden.
Since 1999.
That it's not forbidden to sell sex.
But I wanted to buy sex.
The idea is at the base of this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception and, therefore, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-vernamental organizations on the ground, that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse, and that indicate that this law puts in greater risk.
The own drivers put rich people to know how to dry sex and that increase their sustainability to violence.
It's the stigma and the disease.
(Audience) Yes!
Another idea we all have is that this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
(Laughter) They are victims.
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources, and this idea of what the client has a criminality.
For an idea that I think is ideologically invested, even because research has shown that relationships between...
The workers of their sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of connecting clients is dehuman.
They are the people who are deficiency carriers.
Or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go back to sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its sexuality and its pleasure, and many of them can make sex professionals run.
There are even countries.
That has the fungal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is someone who receives train.
I want to know how to have sexual donations with people who are disabled.
I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work.
about sexual work relevance.
And now, it has destroyed any argument that tries to be favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people...
You can do this as an option.
If people think that for them it's the best option, at that moment of your life, to face it.
To their economic needs.
Audience: Yes.
Why do we continue if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done you."
It was found on the work commissions.
If this can be done without more exploration than in the workplace, why do we continue?
How can we give so strongly the people who do sexual work, why do stigmatism is so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral?
Sexual, which divides sexuality in two types.
On the one hand, it has a sexuality considered legitimate.
"Normal."
And natural, and we have a security and considered illegitimate.
It's normal, anti-natural, and that's where the sex begins.
And the fact that this century is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural is based on stigmatization.
The social rejection, the description of the sanction, of the desvalorization of people who do this activity.
In other words, stigma is a brand that confirms deep discomfort.
The stigma that rejects sex employees is strongly put in many consequences: stigma, humanize, stigma is a form of violence that is based on so much discrimination on sex creators.
Like, for example.
When they drive in health institutions.
In justice and social security and they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way, now, less than I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on the woman.
In fact, the worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
(Laughter) The stigma of puta divide women in two types, tied and tied, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta is a tool that is above the head of any of us, any woman knows that if there's a sexual behavior that is divided, normally restricted, it's the service of the sexuality of feminine, it's a kind of duty.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do we think we can do any one, we can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex players?
And I think the path is the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
It's to challenge the stigma.
But I'm here doing this moment and giving voice.
Listen to sex workers.
Dar voice to a group that has been.
There's something of the most attempt to the oldest silencing throughout time.
It's sex consumers.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70s, but precisely because of stigma, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
After all this ...
And to finish?
I think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex workers.
Thank you (Applause)
(Applause) I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Article, healing, art.
To heal, to be a doctor?
It was the power of a fundamental letter.
In the medium relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, where I have to get involved, spiritually, in a way that I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have there, empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor.
It's a technical judgment and for me to play.
The best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationship of our time, with all the most superficial and rare, I'm the balance that's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, and they were also there.
A different time.
When we got there, our arrogance ...
From "elite Branca," I thought I would take something to them.
But I didn't dress the Indius, the Indius said goodbye.
I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood.
And to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and offer to that person that involvement, that love.
This assistance there.
He's polar.
That's it.
And this convention, the request of floor and hours.
Honoran.
All the doctors who go with us and focus on it.
And Rocky.
And we bring to São Paulo, which brings us to another daily practice.
I said, "Yes."
The simplification that happens there can be replied here too.
It's the grandmother who doesn't need to go to the Amazon to discover this.
So, the path I had to discover.
There's a study that shows that at the beginning of medical college.
Have you made a list of objective toys all over the world?
The first goal is.
Very good.
It's going to be OK.
These same students, at the end of the medical curtain.
With the same research?
Only the succession discrimination is knowledge.
It's crazy.
Some time we did it wrong?
If we got someone who had a poetic brilliant TV?
And we delivered someone technical, who knew a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
The concern with the oldest relationship with the patient, with the medicine, goes back to the past.
In Greece, which is the weight in medicine, where the father is, the medicine that is poor.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't affected.
When Adão caught the apple, the Eva desengastated, and this was to make a terrible aviary, it's what we do until today, so I play the same thing.
So why is the address considered, instead, to define me and little to my father, to teach me why for the first time?
And there's a method there.
It can be art, healing, something that can be taught, learned, retrodesized, replicated.
And in a way that the development of these people had a logic.
In that song too, it was developed, it was created a pócric isolation.
And even today, it's used in medicine shapes.
For the world, it was made a 7.5 BC.
It's a good person, OK.
They're words very complex, and I've prepared three words here.
In all the houses I entered, I just talked about the benefits of the diseases.
Exiting all bad volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and sisters.
That's why they saw the respectant life of the sick people in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
It's respecting this judgment and not violating, being the dignity of equation between men and all times.
And if I brought the violin, what happens to me?
Why, already at that time, if I was worried about this, and still today you do a journey?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
So, huh?
Today, few things are registered with honor judgment.
And, in this case, I've had a work of participating in a transition that is registered to a John's judgment.
The medical knowledge in Greece is a individual to produce science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So today, a patient has a medical team because he takes care of it.
A class and this class, each one is taking care of a little bit like this.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this and losing the patient's cure.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class, in college, in a group class, as a teacher.
And ...
I tricked to do these ladies, patients, Tomography, resonance, and Economics, and Lutração.
I'll put my hand in the belly, I'll be at home of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
She called me so, called everyone and said, "Let's see the patient's barrier."
He looked and had to cover the patient's finger and noticed that he was smoking and saying he didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth, and he showed that he had emagressed.
As you're on the loss, it's light and dose, you can see yourself.
And he's able to take care of his own clothes, a South, he can talk a lot, "The time you're wearing a patient, there's a moment of intimacy, you can remember something that doesn't give us any consultation," and he said, "If everything didn't convince us?"
Besides, as you're seeing, patients.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're thinking you're mixing it.
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "No verbally for him that you have taken care of him."
You're mixing the book, you want to do the good, and he's asking him, "Let me take care of you."
This is the magic, it's not just beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, ICU, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, who are appealed, better at a fastest time.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, a house where we don't know why it appears.
There's no operation in exams, there's no administrative interactions, there's no Haiti, there's nothing, the diseases are there.
Do they say what happens if our society is a little sick?
Some of you may raise your hand and say, "Well, very interesting, you'll talk about the best relationship.
But being a patient's relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are talking to me.
I don't want you to talk to a group of mind, because, after all, the act of relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two steps.
Here in the doctors, there are two.
It's time for us to stop, for those who know we're passive, and we have to take our hands into our curve process.
And it's not only to look for the healthy, but also to engage your cure process in the decisions of the cure trace.
To do this, the first point, the most important thing, is information.
Where we're talking about Dr. Google, who's fashionable, not fashionable, when I was a child, there were many copies this size in my health care.
There was a book, a book of health, and this existed without giving up.
The difference is that, in that occasion, to convince someone to publish something, because it's an editor, you had to have content to talk.
Today, with Google, you have a very good information teaching, very important, but many very bad things.
And we need to know how to filter the ability to generate information, it's greater than the result.
So there are some things we have to think about seeing information first.
In fact, today's information is usually assigned.
I have a blog in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people enter with my curriculum, but you know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people get there, hear what I want to say, and they don't know what I did, what I studied, and they'll allow me for anything, and that's bad, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, or video games, or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing, didn't believe in basic things in the lab, obviously, has changed, now your problems have finished.
Generally this nursery.
Differently a laboratory with the scientist will have an immediate discovery without the society to feel like it.
Don't be maturing this for a while.
The information occurs, nobody is doing anything alone, so there's nothing to discover today, and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if you have a paranoid channel like the industry, you don't want you to get out of it.
You're low, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and excuses behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president.
And for a long time.
The idea is the solution: disgust your doctor, he's there for that.
Information in the same knowledge, information and information is a knowledge.
Take information, take part in your cure, but tell your doctor.
Second thing, it's very important to be active in the Nation Proceta de Cura.
That's it.
To ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know who you are, that he's medicine.
There's a right to know the risk of that surgery: "Oh, in a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me, I work 20 years later."
I know there's little time.
But I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture of it.
To exist, to demand isn't to get there fighting with everyone, it's not a teacher, it's not that.
Slowly, to know.
To exist, to composition with time, we'll go.
To make the atendments be different.
The methods want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to have this attempt, or the name now, they want to have it with chaos.
Once I was in Amazonia, in the tenderness of her, she was a mountain, nobody was a mother.
And we had a patient there, he had a penis cancer.
It's a moon.
Thank you very much.
And there wasn't any orologist, it's with us to bring them to São Paulo, to be treated here in the future of cancer.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his practice.
It was an index that didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor obviously didn't speak Germany.
I had a translator, I was the son, the boy who spoke very good at Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was obviously scared.
And I belonged to a question.
And for me, it would give us a scene of a movie.
The Indius looked at the doctor.
That's it.
The summer was.
That's it.
That's it.
(Laughter)
When I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
Have you guessed?
There's no language without having a completely different culture than the other.
I gave the soul to that other individual, I had all the interest of taking care of it.
Is this magic?
It's the art of cure.
You don't need to count a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thought that there are doctors attending in prototypes, in ambulants, in consultants.
So, anonymous is it.
What's going on?
Being a good fight.
It's curating, understanding.
So?
We, doctors.
We have to try to find.
More unity is our treatment.
More guilt.
All patients.
To be active in your pure process.
And that makes me feel a connection.
I want the world to be better and you'll be more well-being, what's difficult.
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause)
It's the community of the decisions that I'm going to show you, a story that changed my way of making decisions, and it's very interesting that, in two groups, the respect of this experiment is that the great majority of people choose the author's choice, if I like the Earth's Earth's Earth's - and the second group - the second group - and the second group - which has a very important solution - and it's to influence it - and it's a lot of these options, and it's a lot of the same way, and it's a lot of the way, and it's a lot of information, because it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a way, and it's not a lot of the same, and it's a digital technology, and it's a lot, and it's a lot, and it's a lot, and it's not a way, and it's a way, and it's a way, and it's not a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot,
