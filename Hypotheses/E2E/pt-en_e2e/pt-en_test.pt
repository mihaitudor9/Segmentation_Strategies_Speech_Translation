Have you ever thought about how people's residents are?
If there's any difference, or should it have?
My role as an inclusive way stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone, people with and without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue move so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my conclusion of course, and one day a jury went through a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress?
Is there any difficulty to put clothes?
Does someone's help need?
Or is it interested in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head, and I decided to do my job about it.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
Then I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time, and they told me that all of them had interest in fashion.
However, almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took it to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made the fall of the piece lose.
Except that they lost a lot of time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work of these conversations, the conclusion I arrived was that this vestuary was really necessary for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It's from a desfile with other women without disability.
And I did it, a cause with high-pitched, elastic in the belt to give greater comfort, made a super discreet zip to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress and with some surface.
And, obviously, I didn't put bags on my back because I didn't make sense.
This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfold with another without disability, and I made Carlena a blouse that had open in the shoulders, with a pressure button, to facilitate, at the time, to pass the head.
In fact, for people who are quadriplegics, the ideal is to think of a vestuary that facilitates who will dress the person.
And for paraplegics that give autonomy to the person to be able to dress alone.
In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disability.
And for pattern, I made a very ergonomic seat.
I've already done it in the sitting position to give greater comfort.
Dragile, who is visually impaired, made a dress that she could use in many ways.
On top to the bottom, below the top, reversible.
And I wrote her name to remember him, so she could identify that that piece would be the one who would use her son's day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making tags and labels in braille for people to have access to some basic information, like size and color of the play.
And for women, with ananism or low status, the ideal is to think of an adult style, but with adaptations, for those who don't need to find the ideal role, the child's birth of the shops.
Imagine clothes with princesses and colorful reasons.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people.
They feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability.
This means more than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, such as colorful wheelchairs, stamped and more technological products.
Did you know it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world?
It's already in the 10th edition.
I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana.
I took this second place.
And many other people, Silvana, Drika, small brands, many other stylists are already adapting pieces in their schools.
But it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, realized the real need of this virtual and are already launching inclusive collections.
As an American Thomas, who was already in his second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first.
And the Target, also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
The world is changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But in the future, I don't need to use this term more, because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My family has always come from the face.
I always liked to be in the middle of the forest.
My life, in the middle of the forest, was to live with animals.
And my biggest focus was to work with children.
The four-year-old child, even adolescence, and goes through adults.
(Video) My community started working as I said.
And I was designing people, how to collect them.
To be separated with the other's trash.
So I tried to talk to children and it was winning the parents' awareness.
The parents who were catching me the children.
People recognize me in the community.
I just studied, until I was serious, I didn't have the privilege to go to school to graduate, but today I feel like an educator.
And I go to the children I know.
In my community, we have a seed harvest when we go to the forest to work with the SAF.
We have a plant that I met a plant called her name of Engar.
It's a light plant that we plant everything under it.
It's a plant that recovers the soil's fast.
And all the plants that we have under it, we have a good result.
In our community, when I went to Brapa, I knew that all plants were used each one in their place.
But I tried to imitate with a forest in myth.
I had to imitate the forest because there in the arm there was a lot of pray that was giving in the plants.
And there, in our forest, I saw there was no plague.
So I tried to plant them, variing, there I have the guilt, graviolous, Andyroba, Copaiba, with Maru, Guaraná.
And everything, there, doesn't give up.
"Lianticom" there everything is natural.
In the arm, I saw that I had a lot of poison, very toxic.
The fruit of side without our comparison.
In our community, we work there, everything with organic.
You eat everything natural.
There's no toxin in our communities.
I compare the human being as an animal.
The child compared it and said, "How can you do it?"
You talk, it's listening, and then it's going through other children.
I'm paying and I'm listening to this tension.
Then he talks to the quota.
I compare children like this.
And to deal with human beings, we have to be patient, have to show love, have to have affection.
Mom, the greatest care for those children.
So, I was looking for my knowledge, and it was putting everything in the eye.
My father says, "The first lesson we have to go to the person has to come home."
So, I'm a person who has always been where I walk, I'm observing, I'm a person who observes my house, saw that my wife always likes to be everything, things don't exist there, everything's beautiful.
So, I saw that all this with my work that I was doing with children, who is the future, and it's going to work.
And today, we have a job inside with which it's the wave of the human being.
When I started there, we started in a thousand children.
For those who don't know what's far from the other hand, it's the Amazon's tartaruga.
We worked there and started with my son, today we're arrested 25,000 children.
And we're bouncing the river that, before, had a dam in front of us a little bit of our community.
And this dam made it and ended up with the river.
And today, we have the "repovo Andovil."
Today, in our situation, it's a very happy situation to be able to live with nature, to understand nature, and I've always liked the forest.
I'm going to pass to people.
Nowadays, when I talk about a forest, for those who live with it, for those who feel, we breathe a pure air there.
So, my experience in the forest is always talking to people educating children and going through other people.
If there's a message to leave here, a phrase that's very little, that I'm like this, when I'm in the community, people come to us and come to the next of us, we're talking, and I'm very happy.
So, I'm yours, if I don't pass my message, my education to other people, I even feel guilty.
Thank you very much, guys.
(Applause)
I got married with a name, I have two wonderful children, who were raised thanks to two women who helped us in California to generate these children.
They are very proud of my family and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream true and create this family.
Two months ago, our Sophie and Tancrède, or the biggest of 11 years, was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers here as we feel, as a fear of losing our child.
And we had two options: we could fly, cry.
Or to solve, fight, believe.
It's strength and continuing looking for an ossia to find it for him, to make a transplant of fear, which is what he needs to be cured.
And it was very incredible, because all the most schools and all the most friends, made a very big movement, sharing the press, social networks, by all places, taking people, touching blood, medulating.
Very incredible!
It was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us.
It's not us and then for the rest of the world.
The first message was that when a child has leukemia and tries of life, all the problems of fears, concerns don't matter.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
We learned to be a lesson and it spreads to our friends, to the most of the school, to society, people in Facebook, saying, "It's true, it doesn't matter, that problem I had, it doesn't matter anymore."
The most important thing is life.
Life for life and for love.
The second message that happened with this disease, the public, and all that movement of finding a donor, was that people saw us as a family, homosexual, a parental man.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women, or a father of a mother to be in the family.
Or a living father?
Or a more divorced warrior?
Or importantly, I love the family, that union, that's what gives strength.
This gives life.
That's what will save my son's life.
And the third very important message that I crossed with this disease, for the world, is that my blood, my medulation, we were able to manufacture them.
Our manufacture.
The blood is only blind.
A human being can donate for another human.
So credit raised that awareness.
We have this ability to donate blood for those who need it.
And Sammy is not for someone who is at home, not blood.
The blood is needed in the parts, when we have an accident, at any moment, all banks need it.
Medula Óssea is to catastrophe as the owner of Medula Ocea, the chances of compatibility between a donor and a patient is from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's like a mega-sense.
You can save a life.
It can be a hero.
When I got married, "Oh, it was a very beautiful moment for me.
Are you waiting for them to call me so that I can save in life?
Without any effort, without any pain.
That's donating a part of me to save a life and that.
It's a beautiful thing.
A message that is so credit happens to all of us.
I am grateful to all of you to support us for that union that we are not feeling, that support in condition, not only to save the lives of Tancrède, but to have that awareness that we can all don't hurt to save lives and be superheroes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She slept in Laikom.
Great to you.
It's enough for you.
This is Soundation, two slams.
My name is Talal Al-Tinaü.
I was born in Damasco, Syria capital.
And, in January, I studied at Damasco's University.
Today I'm a refugee, not Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Arabic is a bit in front of Portuguese.
(Laughter) That's why I'm sorry, without some moments it's difficult to understand what I say.
Today, I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most.
But I think that it's exercise on Islam because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
The winner of the war, the beer, the tranquility, and easy to live.
The population was 23 million people.
And I had my family, friends I knew about this child, two apartments and a car in Damasco.
I liked traveling and I loved to know the world.
I went to countries like the United States, Spain and France.
Until one day the war started.
March 15, 2011 in Draa.
Then, I get to all the other cities of the country.
My mask city was the safer in Syria.
I had between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
After five years of war, the country is destroyed.
Guys, those who know it were forced to carry, hide their children, found their pregnant wives and mutilated by a bomb.
Meliars disappeared and didn't come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know if I went back home, when I left to work.
I know how to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian will be stuck, dead or refugee in other countries.
In my family, we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because our relatives and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return some day to my country.
My father, my brother, still lives there.
You, if I hear them again.
To protect my family, I went to Barabairote.
After ten months, Brazil had opened doors for Syrian.
So, I went to talk about the Brazilian ambassade and wish São Paulo to be the best city to go to Brazil, because I had more opportunities.
I had just one week to leave behind 40 years of my life and start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family.
Two children, Orial, 11 years old, and it was like a lot.
Today, I have a Brazilian daughter, Sara, nine months old.
In Brazil, I had a party to celebrate my children's birthday.
And everyone said very well, "The food my good things did."
They will say that it's a very beautiful kitchen, and make food to sell.
That's when I created "Bagina no Facebook" or "Siria's Talal."
That's why now, everything has a pen and paper.
It's left, it's a number, it's like this.
(Applause) I make food and deliver to Tibor WhatsApp.
(Laughter) We are happy in Brazil.
We thank the reception of the Brazilian people.
You opened the doors when the world was closed brown.
Etrestchi, who, on account of the war and of terrorist attacks, many people had an wrong idea about Syrian and Islam.
And tomorrow, here, a journalist says, "I, after it happened in France, now, and I don't want to talk about the contact with a Muslim person."
I think the slam likes blood that is allowed to kill in the name of religion.
But exactly the opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not about French.
More, also for us, or Syrian.
The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that is taking the image of Islam or a basic religion.
Or Alcurão, I'm not a sacred book, that kills a person, without it having killed another, hosted by corruption, a land, and as if it kills all men.
And those who read life, will be like giving life to all men.
Alcurão, south to your mother, see school, 32.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
They kill Muslims, Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between Brazilians and Brazilians, even with religion cultures.
When I make a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, my wife asked me, "Why do you use this heat?"
(Laughter) Do you use this lesson at home, OK?
In Jabi's India, there are other rules.
Men and women can't play, embrace, embrace, executive, of voice, of marriage.
Some people tell me, "But I've already seen the humans who do all this."
Kebeijam is hug.
Let's see, so slam, those rules, more each person wants to eat, or not.
It also brings some things to be the same way they have to be, that they don't obey everything.
But it's not allowed as a pork cane in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me if I drink alcohol or if it was sex with more than a partner.
This is not happening with me.
(Laughter) Why?
Because these things are exhausted from the slam.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Moislam, after we explain to ourselves, people always understand and respect.
Profect Mohamadez, which we should respect all religions.
And all people have the same value that we must have truth with everyone, it doesn't matter if there are black or indigenous white people.
Well, soon as we have to help people who need it.
Every year we have Alsaka and we give 2.5 percent of all our money for the poorest people.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims, crystals or Jews.
I invite you to learn more about Islam.
And a certainty that was like to understand that it's a basis religion.
Now, my dream, here in Brazil, is that the world knows the best Islam to end with "Oubre Cocento."
They make my children, their children will be able to grow together based on them.
What is the molecule?
(Applause)
In the small lifestyles of life, I come to recite my rhythms, in the Sun of Santos, I prepare myself to take a bathroom, always disappointed, I don't know who suffers from whoever believes, who always reaches, I don't believe me, but I't find myself in the mall.
I don't understand this, if you put me so much to pay a secret course, but if you want to enter the office,
Sorry.
As I had an event, yes.
To clean everything and wash the bathroom, days pass, the months fly, and the years also go, and I, here, in the same situation: "DEO, ME," is to be the domestic.
If it were for the option, I have many friends who are already conformed, but I don't.
I want to conquer new areas: please, give me an opportunity, and the lunch told me, "You follow this corridor, go straight, go to the left, enter that little box that the vastor is waiting, be welcome."
This poetry wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote it.
Today I'm here to talk about the success of the website: domestic employee, the page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 this same, this year.
She's still not completed four months.
And how do I create this landscape?
It wasn't programmed at all.
I was at home of vacation, due to everyday running, sometimes we don't have time to think and see everything we've already achieved in life.
So I picked up one day, in the midst of my race life, and I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved.
My dream was to live near the beach, and today I live at the top of the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a domestic employee.
And, as I use Facebook as a newspaper, I put everything that happens, my mother even brings me, "Menina, you can do Facebook!"
It's tomorrow, it's my new daily life.
So I decided to share the things that came to my mind because I was a maid for seven years.
And then I warned Mrs. Ana, person, "I came to the memory, some reports will start to bet this on Facebook, and I'll use the website and the domestic employee, so that other people have already gone through this too, and then I'll be following that everyone wrote."
We're always talking about the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast.
And then, soon after that, I put my first story.
My first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santos.
This in 2009.
I was hired to be a cook, and my pattern prevented me from feeding my own food I did.
I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at her house and not the bathroom.
In her house, there was a bathroom for domestics.
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken.
And there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom.
This was a person who always said I was treated as if it were from the family.
From that moment on, when I compatted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast.
And then I felt the need to create the page, because I started to receive so many stories.
I thought I would receive only past stories, and not stories from today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, it has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 emails reporting these stories.
I gave interviews to various media, both the international media and the national media, London babies, TV, Germany, and many others.
I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, I saw Skype that everyone, all of them moved a lot when I started talking about domestic situations here in Brazil.
Then they managed to compose each other and I started talking about these stories.
Why? Because in the world,
The domestic work outside Brazil has another symbolism.
The most valued domestications earn for hours, so totally different from our country.
I also receive, in my page, several abusive announces, from the job announces that I titled "How abusive announces."
For example, a announcement I read was for worker and working in the second, the sixth, eight in the morning, winning 380 Brazilian reais.
"Please!
"No."
week?
Very less.
Puts.
In fact, for the month, this is our condition here in Brazil.
There are domestic, going through these conditions still today.
There are domestics that are being asked to feed themselves, and they don't earn value.
There are domestics not being able to use the bathroom and suffering all these atrocities that I've always mentioned in the page.
But, during these seven years, there were several oppression stories, but in the only house I found something I call humanized treatment, which is Regina.
So when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I always did, and I entered a room that had a gigantic library.
And I've always liked reading, but even today it's very expensive.
And my domestic mother, my father, a wallet, didn't have the conditions to buy the books I wanted.
And then I was very excited to see so many books and started to shake.
This became a daily practice.
What did I do to get there?
I'd go to her house, pull everything quickly, leave half an hour to clean, to the TV, right?
And Haly was sitting down deliciating me with those books.
And for me, surprise, the region enters the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life.
And, knowing about the experiences I had already gone through last year, I was very nervous.
She sat there and said, "What are you doing?"
I went there and said, "I started to get out of the pop and saw there was a book.
You need it.
And there I was very nervous and she said, "Wow, you have the interest in studying.
I said, "Yes, my dream is to be a story teacher.
Since I was a child, I read many books, I want to understand the history of the world.
And there she started to indicate several texts that, in 2009, when I entered the university, I arrived to read at the university as well.
So, this is what I call humanized treatment.
In 2009, it was very difficult to conveil the university with the faxines.
Because I entered the university, everything was solved.
No, I had to pay the month.
And, thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarize some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make test, which is very difficult to get a totally heavy job with the studies.
And for those who think that I was the first to talk about these women working in situations in Brazilian traditional families and show that slavery hasn't ended, there are women working in slavery situations.
I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool.
But there was, in this world, a woman called Lao delina de Campos Melo, black woman like me, who, in the '60s, created the first Sindicato of domestics.
And she was known by the media of the time as the land of the patterns.
All of this, when I comment and show some stories, people say, "Wow, it's very heavy."
"Yes."
Today, I came here to generate discomfort, because I believe that only through discomfort we can change some things.
Nobody will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, right?
Because the great majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013, are black women.
And this can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place.
It's a work like any one.
Yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil.
And 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman.
Why do I say it's the sedentary service?
My grandmother was a domestic.
My mother was a domestic.
And I was also a domestic.
When I got there to tell my mother that I would be a domestic, she started to cry.
And I stayed without understanding, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum, with a good picture and a good appearance, is never black.
When I understood this and started to deliver with rhythms without photos, they called me at least a interview.
It was a suspicious, this after a format, OK?
I took a dirt to see my experiences, to have established this, that, and so, "Are you?"
Yes, or I'm magic.
(Laughter) (Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are revolution apartments today.
What domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala is the little corner of the employee.
She came running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for a long time for her to get there.
"You're ugly day of payment."
I listened there, entering the car, the baruline of the key, opening the door.
"Wow, my pattern came."
And then, when I get there, I was already with a clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me.
Then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so bad.
"Wow, forgotten to take your money on Monday to Tipago."
The modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was little, with so much ice and affection.
Her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered was me who was there.
I only wanted to see her marrying, "That's it!"
But, unfortunately, they didn't invite me to marriage.
But, as I'm aldacious, I put my best clothes, I went to the church, I stayed there hidden, and I put my girl marrying.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
It's Christmas, I'm seeing my dress family, everyone happy.
And I fought a sadness because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work.
He's going to work, he takes his wife to work, talks to his wife who's going to work, but he returns home, to harvest me.
And the only solution I had was to take part in all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get stuck.
If I clean the bathroom, I get stuck.
And so, I can flee from his seeds.
Because when I say I'm going to change jobs, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,700 Brazilian reais per month?"
You'll never win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children on the northeast.
And they need this money.
What modern senzala is the little corner of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of sorvete.
Because my little poetry of sorvete is my penic.
And then I was there, in the service room, pressed, took my little pot to be seen, and made this number one.
And my pattern saw me, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little pot of saving?
"Are you using the bathroom?"
What is this?
What's happening?
"No."
Your bathroom can use it?
In the other houses I worked, I couldn't use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought the little pot.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
Today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Men, you have to be happy where you are."
For this attention, was your grandma a domestic?
His mother wasn't a domestic either.
It's already predicted for your family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being seen.
So, I'm here, a storyteller, a black woman, fat ... (Applause) (Applause) Ferica, black woman, fat, prosecutor, peripheric and rock.
(Applause) My side, I'm not here today, behind me, there are 6 million domestic women who should be here on my side, and that at some point they will be.
Everything I do would run my life, not thinking about money we don't have money, but only to see that six million domestic people are there cleaning me, that's what I want to provoke at that moment.
Because everyone here must have many patterns, many patterns, and some domestic ones.
If each one takes this idea of talking and humanizing the relationships, we'll decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestics work and study, and here, this domestic work has as private property.
We can see in the airports, "Why do babies have to be wearing white people?"
Is it uniform?
Yes, to be able to identify it, and they're inside the house.
Is the pattern not know it's a nanny?
It's to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country.
I'm here in the statistics, I'm not alone, I'm talking about 6 million women.
(Applause) Except your apps and thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you.
I'm here today to talk about silence.
which is already a bit funny, left, but the only way to communicate is talking.
I'll ask you, for the first time in my talk, to disconnect.
You connect your cell phones, don't photograph, even because I'm dying of fear, and if you're photographing my fear, I'll be uncomfortable even more.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence for us, human beings?
Some may say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally, because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago, I was in a table, in a surgical center, and then I was doing eight, the conceptive surgery of my eyes was already very inflamed.
When the Syrian started, I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia, and then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Focisco, it's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's do it?
And I was almost 30 years old, I meditated more than 20 from the top of my ego, I was sure I would realize.
It started, sponsors, inflammation points, the first past to dress, and the insecure, with equipment, opens the word, "Wow!"
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wasn't going to tell.
In the midst of this chaos, of this situation, I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, " Silence is the entrance door to the state of presence.
When I remembered that, after 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When I put your foot in front of you, you're the feeling of this moment of presence, and you're not the consequence of what you've already lived, and you're not the human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, you don't have sex.
You're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, folks, what I found was fear, it was very angry, it was a lot fear, it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions, that I didn't know who lived inside me.
They were the consequence of the story of everything I had already lived.
And then, the discovery was: everything I had experienced was determining the way I thought, the way I act, the way I realized life was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to delegate your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you have only kept yours.
Several of you thought, "No, I need it."
Others justified his importance.
Now, I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone, take it.
Because you all have it.
They hear me, all of you have a cell phone.
They delegate him.
"Take a leg."
Come space.
It's not to get rid of you, it's unleasant.
Disconnected cell phones put them on the floor.
(Laughter) Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close them.
And you, who were anoting our notebooks, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not disconnected.
You took close to you the external connection tool.
Who connects themselves is the human being.
Now, look at this environment where you are.
Look at me, look at the ceiling walls, look back to the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
"Look at the guy in this way."
You're fine, right?
I won even a little kiss.
(Laughter) He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Do you see?
Did you see?
Audience: Yes.
I said, "No."
Audience: Yes!
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, closed eyes, really closed, some of you will have a moment of resistance.
It's a resistance that is born of fear.
Anyway, it's not the fear of this guy in front of me.
Until this guy, in this moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Of closed eyes, there's space with me.
Remember where you are.
Remember the walls, remember this size of the approximate dimensions in the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, in Latin America.
They locate themselves.
At this moment, we are connecting a natural and subutilized system of the human brain.
We are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have a strong direction center, there's a knowledge, you know where you are.
In the knowledge of your position, we wake up a new function, a new area of the brain.
At this moment, a different piece of your mind is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system, feel where you are, sitting on the chair.
You remember, when you were children, you took your hand to the hot chicer, and soon you learned that a little before your hand touched the chicken, you felt the temperature and took your fingers to the chicle's house.
In feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the system of connected vocalization, and feeling where you are, observe.
And apply the space location system to your minimum space.
It evolves the area you occupy inside this room.
And then, realize the occupied area, more than that, feel what makes the area you occupy.
Open your eyes.
Strange.
"No."
"No."
It's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new, it's new, it's new, it's new, inclusion.
There's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence is to realize that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
To look inside is in silence, it's to have real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become on the planet, along with our evolutionary process, more than 10,000 years ago.
All of them are available are simple, but they are last generations technologies.
We already know that in the future of the evolution of race, communication will be direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you that you don't need to be afraid to disconnect because the connection, in fact, happens when you communicate authenticity to another authenticity.
Silence is a source of freedom.
Doubted.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Who has never been passionate about a TED talk that had the first video, (Laughter) which is normally the first view, as my case was.
I can say that it's an absolutely lasting tradition.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translated from a demand of a legion of famous TEDx, that asked for translations in a shared way with their friends, their colleagues, their family.
In Brazil's case, the work of translation is fundamental once it's only 5% or less influence.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Nowadays, we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world, 10% of them are Brazilians, translating around 6,000 translations around the world.
But we're not only translated, as we've also transferred the talks made in events or these here.
The work of transition is very important, not only to take our TEDx to the world, but it compares to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the talks.
When the talk isn't given in English, like my case here is in Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language to later be fertilized for more languages.
Initially, the TEDx with its own scientific logotype, addressed only as the technology of the TED, entertainment, which is the "e" that we can translate as immersion and design the people to refer to.
Nowadays, talks approach an inferiority of subjects that go from accidents to the political, businesses, entrepreneurship, even literature.
We have, for example, talks that promote the smells of another of my passions.
This year, what defines the subject is this auditory accident.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest life expectancy, but also the reduction of the journey of human work throughout history.
I think the fact that one of the use I do of my productive president is to translate, review, and see how a bubble talks in a TEDx environment that can be the right to these TEDx pieces, or if they want to have very small children.
I do this, not only because I had fantastic people, people, inspiring people, but because I think it's worth using my hearing accident, not only because I think it's worth using my hearing sector in initiatives like this one.
The second frame was to give light to yourself and become what is potentially.
I don't come from education, it's fundamental for this, and I don't have a doubt that education is fundamental for those people, less privileged, with good privileges, or excluded for our society, can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's a donation work.
Being at your time, being aware of your knowledge, being judged by an object, precisely because of your volunteer job, because if you choose mine, a mine decision, I have to do it in the best way possible and I have to commit myself.
To donate the time that a shadow is different from donating the pieces of our time.
The tradition of complex activity that demands not only to know the foreign language, but mainly our world, and it makes sources that young people had.
On the other hand of a perfect translation, there's always a dream of knowledge in the middle, a lot of research, a lot of work, many hours of verification.
And behind such a fluent translation for the elderly and sneakers, there's always a big man who's worried and frustrated with facts that, the best he does, he can always be improved in almost in definitely.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers is not professional.
This is very important to decide in the area, the majority.
But, despite this, we create, by the quality of our translations, not only in the speaker's respect, but in respect to those who talk, right?
And to guarantee this balance, all these translations and transcessions go through a coordinator of a language, or as we call it for an event.
In the case of Brazil, in the Portuguese Portuguese, because we have the Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is different, we have ten NCs, which I'd like to mention at least.
I read stories.
We have XPM, we have Maricene, Claudia, and me.
We have our guys who were out of my nose, liked it, the tone or the stadium, and the Rafael.
Very well, this obsession that I have with education, in fact, has to say, not only with Brazil, that lives a deep political crisis in which education is delighted by the bread, but without seeing my own personal story.
My father, who today was two years old, got hurt the primary course.
Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well.
And his dream was to always be able to study the language I've studied and do how kids would study.
That's why, the one who lived in our young girls called "Tairobeas," decided to change their four children at the time, I pay a lot of slaves: the biggest city in the United States.
In some sides, my father came from his beginning, his logic, the Uberas, and his success also established with a commissioner.
They had a small hotel with a presence store, they had a big version.
At the same time, in 1964, there was a great exception in Brazil.
After this reception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and understood absolutely everything.
They literally said, "Nothing!
For years, I've been killed in the cells with the serious furniture.
They felt the humiliated feeling of their boyfriend and my father decided, after paying his debates, if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold mother, playing back, eating well-being.
In Belo Horizonte, my mother, who today has a few years old, doesn't help me, besides being a vacuum in the Parado's games or even a hole, (Laughter) was a cooking event.
Sclusions of training, my mother.
And she decided to do a wealth to live.
So, for many years in my house, Ponte queijo was literally gained.
Let's say this disguise of the best "Poi de queijo" by two years.
So, even though we don't have to eat, many times, I don't have to dress from one thing, my father is not Adriama, that we are destroyed to study.
And so it was done.
A big fact without a doubt, because according to the data of the nursery research in the Parliamental Parliament of the 48 years, at 68 years old, only 32% of people with greater insolarity than the fundamental one.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had in education, disappeared in the small gestures.
My father, for example, had the habit of putting myself standing when I was seven years old.
At that time, we were going to take the college entrance exams.
The microphone keeps in mind, they catch the phenomenon, they choose a broadcast, and in a few visits that appeared at home.
You can't act, right?
Then I'm entering the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the biggest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, she would get to laugh, shaking.
Without knowing, he was entering a little to this talk here.
Anyway, I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than that today, we were able to give our children better conditions than we had, right?
And here I say, for me, the biggest passion in my life, of my greatest politician, are my beloved children, Daniel, Rio Grande do Sul, which are the ones I've never put these battles for my newspapers, but for those of the stories before you live.
It's a adventure that was always a pleasure for me and for my children.
Coincidence or not, almost of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is to be a question at some point in life.
And one of the brothers is the primary educator, also fantastic, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to educate for obsession.
You'll be obsessed with education.
Despite the limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiatives on TEDx has to have, just like my father, for their simple way, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these wonderful speakers, to think about everything we can.
(Applause)
Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that we had our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where we can feel the things that are written.
(Laughter) During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where they explained how the letters worked, the numbers, the symbols, and so they taught us, but it didn't work very well, because it's super complicated, it's what I'll forget for a while.
But when they returned to classes, I started to be surrounded by some classes and I decided to go back to the braille.
I started writing the letters from dots in my notebook, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I did many times, and I left buying a rulete, which is a little girl who allows me to write in Braille, in which you write that shows the release.
I ended up in China, in my notebook, and my agenda of music letters, movie names.
I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that threatened me to her, that I believed I was learning.
I didn't give tips.
And with that, in the passing of the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Colégio Santa Cruz."
We thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas we could create from what she taught us.
We decided it's a clock where I could feel the time.
We started researching, we wouldn't have thousands of projects, we'd take one on the Internet and be ready to connect with the engines, and we'd have a clock.
But saw that there was no Internet.
We decided it's our own.
I started researching, learning about robotics, programming, our teachers, and trying to create a clock.
So we took the engines, connected with some pines, and wrote a program that would raise the motors, the pines, and show the hours and minutes in braille to make you feel.
For a long time it didn't work, the engines only shake and nothing happened.
We wrote everything, disconnected and recognized everything, and we started to work.
And, more or less a month ago, we finished the clock and showed him to our aunt.
It was very exciting to see how happy she was, that we created something to help others from what she taught us.
They tried to continue this project, try to make a smaller clock, a translator in Braille.
I was very exciting.
All the process we went through, met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Suddenly, we saw that something that was born from our interest could help in our aunt and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So, we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, the senses, the pires, and let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created yet.
And if we, two students from high school, who didn't even finish high school, we're second year, and we're teenagers, we've managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help.
(Applause) Thank you, thank you.
(Applause)
Let me ask you a question.
Who thinks that adult people, in a free and consent, can have sexual relationships with other adult people?
We can't handle it.
OK, we're all agree.
Two or more adults, in a free and consent, can have sexual relationships.
And this is what happens in prostitution, or in sexual work, which is the expression I chose.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that dance crucial is that there's a motorcycle exchange, that is, there's a part of sexual relationship with the aim of having profit and another part with the goal of getting pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it.
I know some hundreds.
Men and women who manage their business in an autonomous way.
They need their announces, they receive their clients, apartments, hotels, or even street pensions, and they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children or adults who are correct.
Except that it evolves in less than 16 years or adults who don't feel that their consent are crime cases.
These are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially, and the delinquants must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution, but in security only children.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, I also think it's a criminal case.
This is always so extinguing between volunteer and forced constitution.
We're also not going to talk about sex traffic situations.
The tendency is to confuse prostitution against sexual exploration.
But taking all the people who do prostitution for victims of sexual operation is to confuse a small part as if it were all.
Investigations have shown that, in Portugal, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual explosion is little expressive.
These are phenomena that identify us, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'll give you the observatory data about trafficking in Portugal, confirmed 118 victims of traffic, human, almost all for the lab exploration.
Vitimate for sexual duration, only three.
Of course, I was going to hear the only victim to justify an judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that there is a whole speech and a half disappointed by reality.
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims, defenses, explored, and who are waiting for someone to save them.
But this doesn't reply to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim and consider that they make an option.
Of course, we know that not everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings, like gender inequalities, inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate.
Economic inequalities, social and cultural inequalities.
We know there is a diversity of contradictions that differentiates the decision-making.
But when we talk, when we interview, with an interviewing encounter, conversations, all the people who do sexual work, what they tell me is that they are an option.
It's a standard option, after educating the advantages and disadvantage, which is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly witnessed and is not recognized.
If I ask you to think about the image you see immediately when you think of a person who prostitute you, think.
Okay?
I bet most of you have thought of two situations.
Or in any human spring, or even in a woman of new aspect and mining that is in a corner, in a dark street, of the city, which is very likely to be stored and, of course, has someone to explore it.
But these are only two stereotypes.
They are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor, reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sexual work.
There is a diversity of people, of practices, of experiences, not all of us have positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences and life trajectories.
They are not just women, they are not just women on the street.
There are men in a sexual work, and there are women driving, they are not just women who are driving.
There are also many transgender women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us when we think about the prostitution from someone on the street, I tell you that the studies that are made and the Western societies, and they try to estimate the number of people who are in the beginning of the century, they will represent only 10 to 20% of the total of people of prostitute.
And when we think about a woman, we're forgetting men who do sexual work.
They are less, they are minority, but they are not negligentable.
I've already studied the data of the study done here in Portugal, which had a greatest sex worker.
It's addressed by the teacher Sônia Dias, from Lisboa University.
140 sec workers, both in the street context, as in the countryside context, men, women, trans people, and in all over the country.
They found 10.2 percent men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage is even more elevated.
However, when the speech is about the victim of a man or a teacher, forget that it's a percentage of men who are in sex work.
I'm going to talk about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly, and that can even appear an idea, apparently humanist, when it's analyzed by very negative consequences for people who do sexual work, and which is the idea of the client's criminalization.
In Sweden, since 1999, that is not forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex.
The idea that is at the base of this law is that people who are in prostitution are victims without exception.
So, if they're victims, they're victims of an oppressor or the client, and so we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other aspects, after the Sweden, and the SwEC government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-violental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse, and that indicate that this law puts the safety, the violence, the stigma and the disease.
Another idea we have is that all the people who are in sexual work are victims, it's an idea that, without big explanation, happens to people's resources.
And this idea that the client has a criminal, a idea that seems ideologically invested to me, even because research has shown that the relationships between workers of sex and clients are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law, this idea of connecting clients is dehuman.
They are the people who are the carriers of disability or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and who go back to sex professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability have the right to their sexuality and their pleasure.
And many of them can make sex professionals.
There are even countries that have the legal figure, which is the sexual assistant, which is someone who receives train to know how to have sexual donations with people who are special carriers.
I think this example is quite clear about the social relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that has destroyed any argument that tries to be in favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people can do this as an option, if this can be done with control over the connections of work, if this can be done without violence, if people think it's the best option in that moment of their lives, to face their economic needs, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do sex work?
Why do stigmatism is so intense and so strong about the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality in two types.
There's a sexuality considered legitimate, normal and natural, and it produces a section of truth and it's considered illegitimate, anormal, anti-natural, and that's where the sex begins.
The fact that this century is considered illegitimate, normal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a mark that confirms deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences.
It's a humanism.
The stigma is a form of violence that is based on so many discrimination about sex workers.
Like, for example, when they drive in institutions in the area of action, justice and social security, and they are treated with prejudice.
I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word, not TEDxBas, "The puta stigma is the worst that can fall on a woman."
The worst offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of puta divide women in two types: tired and tired, seriously and non-series, which behave well and behave badly.
And, in this sense, the stigma of puta is an instrument that is at the service of the feminine sexuality control.
It's a kind of lady's sphere that is above the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if they had a sexual behavior that was disappointed, the norms that are restricted socially, they run the stigma of puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk to be called puta.
So, why do I think we can do any one, we can do so that they don't continue to disrespect sex creators?
I think the path is the human rights of all and including people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence.
This was already quite talking about tomorrow.
Scientific evidence and empirical, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
It's also to recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
But to challenge the stigma that I'm here doing at this moment.
And to give you a voice, to hear sex workers.
To give voice to a group that has been something of the most attempt to the oldest silencing throughout time.
Sexual programmers are around the world organized and used 70.
But, precisely because of stigma, your voice doesn't have credibility, they're not heard.
We don't want compassion or tolerance.
We want rights.
That's what I think we're following.
After all this, do you think it makes sense that it's natural that we must continue to disrespect, to stigmatize and to criminalize sex sovereignors?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have a bad news for you.
Medicine is very old.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Art, well cured, art, healing, being a doctor, is supported by a fundamental stone, in the medical relationship.
This relationship is very delicate, where I have to get involved, spiritually, in the way I understand the suffering of that individual that I have compassion, that I have empathy.
But at the same time, I have to have a digital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment and so that I can add the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate.
And the urban relationships in our time are all more superficial and rare.
There's no balance that's suffering.
In the last 10 years, I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors, they were also there in several times.
When we got there, in our arrogance of white elite, I thought I was going to take something to them.
But I didn't wear the Indian.
Wingium, my challenge.
And when I graduated, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer to that person that involvement of that love.
This assistance, the one who established the request of indigenous people, orario, all the doctors who go with us and focus on there, enlightened.
And we bring to São Paulo, who brings us to our daily practice, that the simplification that happens there can be repeated here too.
It's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon to cover this.
So, it's the path I had to discover.
We have everything that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you give a list of objective to the students, the first objectives are: altruism, to see the good.
In these same students, at the end of the British Medicine, with the same research, the tops of the succession: knowledge, cure.
Some time we made a mistake, we got someone who had a brilliant, poetic stadium, and we gave someone technical who knew a lot about medicine and didn't know anything about people.
The concern with old and patient relationships is based on the past.
It grows that I fish in medicine, where the father, medicine, whatever, doesn't want to say that medicine wasn't affected.
When Adão got married with the apple, the Eva desengastated, and this was to make a loss airplane.
It's what we do until today, it doesn't matter the same thing.
(Laughter) So why is the growth considered, instead of defining, because your father doesn't teach me?
For the first time, he gave a method, he can transform art, heal, something that can be taught, learned in the first time, and in a way that the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion, it was also uncovered, it was created a pócric training, which is even today used in medicine formature for the world.
It was done in a state of fifteen years of crisis.
But now, they're words in the middle.
I prepared three words, in all the houses I entered, I just talked about the benefit of the sick people, hesitating all the volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, of men, of children and of the brain.
That's why they've heard about the life of the sick people in the exercise of my process, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll take silence as a religious secret.
If I respect this judgment and not the violin, it would be the dignity of equation between men and all the time, that I wanted to bring the violin that happened to me.
Why, already in the collection, if I occupy this, and still today, you do the surgery?
We do judgment of things that we transcribe because it has to be transcribed, because the patient's average relationship is essential for good cure.
Today, few things are registered by a man's judgment.
In this case, I have a work of participating in a protest that is registered to the 21st century.
The medical knowledge in Greece is an individual produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this?
The medical knowledge that proliferated in such a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all knowledge.
So, today, a patient has a team of doctors, something like this.
It's a class.
And this class, each one is taking care of a little piece.
With this, we're specializing ourselves a lot in healing this and losing the patient's height.
There's a current theory that says "usami" can talk about the patient.
It can't, no.
Maybe I was in a class in college, in a small class, as a teacher, and I tricked with you to be like this: "Look, patients have, thomography, resonance, and in biology, and mutation."
I focus on a barrier monopoly, after without a degree of consciousness.
"Oh, I'm less composing."
Everyone called me so, called everything, and said, "Let's see the barrier like this."
He looked at the taxi driver's finger and noticed what was smoking and saying that he didn't smoke anymore.
One of the five of them showed that he had emagressed.
But you're on the leg.
How crazy you can see if it's taking care of your own traffic, your own clothes.
A dirty ambigu can talk a lot.
When you're wearing a patient, you'll have a moment of intimacy, you can remember something that didn't give you in the consultation.
He said, "If all this didn't convince you, besides that, when you're seeing the patient, you're here exposed to you to the vulnerable area, sometimes you're letting you move me."
At that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "Don't verbally see him, that you're taking care of him, that you're mixing him, you want to do well, he's asking him to take care of you.
This is the magic, it's not only beautiful to "selfie," but it's replicated in science.
This child has the Christmas, which are collected in the cold, they are characterized, and improved the fastest and faster.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase in our environment.
At the same time, it's a cause we don't know why it appears.
I don't have exam operation, I don't have external interactions, I don't see anything.
That's what we have to do.
Does it happen because our society is a little cloud?
Some of you already raise your hand and say, "Well, very interesting, you talk about the best patient's relationship.
This is a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and being a passive patient, for those who are at least for me.
You'll talk about this for a medical group.
The act of the relationship is not a doctor.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two there.
My doctors tell the two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and it's passive.
And we have to take our hands, which was in our cure process.
And it's not just looking for healthy life.
But also by developing your curious process in the decisions of the curve process.
To do this, the first point, the most important, is information.
Where are we going to talk about Dr. Google, fashion?
It's not fashion.
When I was a child, I had some copies, it was also in the market, but it was useful.
There was a book, the health book.
That had always existed.
The difference is that in that occasion, for you to talk to someone, publish something, because it's an editor, (Laughter) you had to have content to talk.
Today, like Google, you have a very good information teaching, very important, but many very good times.
And we need to know how to filter.
The ability to generate information was greater because the ability to filter.
So there are some things we have to think differently about information.
First, in São Paulo, I'm usually assessed.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people go to my curriculum to know who I am.
This gives me a huge chat because people inside there hear what I think and say, "I don't know what I did, what I studied, and it will allow me for nothing."
And he says, "Wow, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, big money, money, or other things like this."
So, the cilature.
Second very important thing: I didn't believe there were good things to be veilers.
"Look, medicine changed."
Now, your problems ended.
Generally, this neck.
And hardly a lab with the scientist will have an immediate discovery without that the scientific society doesn't kill this for a long time.
The information occurs, nobody does anything alone.
So, there's no thing that's discovered today and tomorrow it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know.
It's too low.
Third, if you have a paranoid thing, like the industry, there's no interest you're taking away from it.
Is it silly?
"Don't worry, it's an effort."
It's hard to have some other interests behind it.
So, for me, it's not a president.
Lastly, ask for information, discuss your doctor.
He's there for that.
Information is not the same knowledge.
Information is information, knowledge and knowledge.
The information is actively part of your cure, but second customer.
The second very important thing to be active in a process of cure is to ask, to demand, to know.
When you talk to your doctor, you have the right to know who gets medicine, without the right to know what risk is in that surgery.
I don't need to say, "Oh, it's a public hospital, the guy has no time to answer me."
I've been working for 20 years, so, I know it took time.
This will change the day to night, but I don't have to have the culture to change, the culture to exist, it's not to get there, fight with everyone in the teacher, it's not that.
It's, slowly, to know how to demand, to composition.
With time, we're going to make the alternatives be different.
The method wants this.
They want to have the right.
But they don't want to have this attempt, like the "Now hour," they want to have it with chaos.
Once, I was in the Amazon, on the Internet, she was in Venezuela, a mountain company, and it was a man who had a patient there, who had cancer and pen.
It's a man and a kiss.
And there was no orologist, with us, bringing São Paulo to be treated at the beginning of cancer.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his practice.
The doctor, obviously, didn't speak Germany, didn't speak Portuguese, was still.
A translator was the son, the boy who spoke very little about Portuguese, as he was very bad, he was really scared.
And I presented a enjoy that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the doctor, is like this: "Ana, bread."
The doctor said, "Hmm."
Five, OK.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to be that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual without setting the language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered his soul to that other individual, had all the interest of taking care of it.
This magic, which is the art of cure.
So you don't need to count, much figure.
It happens.
At that moment, we say, "I have an urge to think, there's a doctor to tend to a prosecutor in Abulavo Tá, taking care of what he is.
So, we, doctors, can try to find more unity in our most compassion treatment.
All patients try to be effective in their cure process.
I wanted to do this because of a connection.
I want the world to be better and you'll be more well-being, just like that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
Audience: Good morning!
I'd like to start with a world here: 35,000.
What are you doing in science?
This number is the number of decisions of the human being drinks every day.
And it gives more or less a decision every two seconds.
There's a board.
In the world, Dorith is the same of making a decision.
It's for those who have been to pay attention to the talk.
I'd like to tell you a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my way of making decisions.
It's an experiment that was done with the record journalist.
On the screen of the magazine, there were three lessons of this nature: a digital administrative of 50 providers, a digital administrative of the company, and also without sponsors.
The result of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how you are 25.
What I like many experiments is that they usually build two groups.
For the second group, it was only an exhibition of two options: a digital option between the authors and the option of how to the institutors too.
The first interesting thing is that for this group of people, the majority of this chose a digital option.
When I wanted to talk about these experiments, I kept thinking that the adoption of the middle of USA has a printed idea that no one chose.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in love?
This left me very uncomfortable with what I wanted more to dance and I didn't make this decision.
And I started to study about this.
It must be very happy, and I discovered that this person is having a man.
She's going to say "Hi."
It's a song that is placed in an equation to influence the issue of a decision or another.
And I learned a lot about this in my theory called Economics and Dal.
It's the theory that studies cognitive psychology and neocience, and this is the appliance of tomatoes and decisions.
There's even a little interesting way to be able to use, but sometimes there are two options of the idea, and you want people to choose the option to have.
Have you ever seen the same thing?
This is what I want to give, it seems to be a better one.
For those who will pay 12 liters, not your company, I'll have two for the same time.
And that's the company at the time.
Because I started to question the king of all this, and a talk we've produced from TED and made the Internet all over it.
When a company made a comparison of these behaviors with illusions that today.
I think everyone appears in the countryside of New York.
The simple assistant appears a little bigger than the other side of the right.
Are you ready?
Because I have to do what we see in a different way.
In fact, they're in my job, but we see them in a different way, because I have a return from the influence.
There's another periodic illusion that I've been fascinated by listening, which is this one that the hope to be filled with above are equal to low chess pieces.
It's the same life that you're going to make the real problem before you get to all of this.
It shows you that it's true: without affecting the pieces, it's only editing the bottom, we see that they are really good.
When I see this presentation, it's better to understand that it makes some sense to say that it has a return to us.
In the same way, what has returned and influenced the way we see things, what also has returned to this evolution of all decisions.
I work in technology, and I didn't know how to avoid working in a project to create an education to see safety.
He was disappointed for the insurance of civilism, right?
It's a lot of option and we're all going to explore it.
You can choose two adoptions, these three or these two, and you won't be able to figure out that we were working, but they said 500 and 11 choices.
And when I was working, the voice was a way to simplify this choice to people.
This way was due to my profession.
If the person was in the program, she would write these three options, it was at the same time, adding this concept to the architecture of decisions where I returned to my decisions, if the person was in the microphone and had these three actions, and that caught me a lot of attention.
In the world of agroecology, there's even the name for this profession.
This is María Ex and the Researchers are the experience of the users.
But exactly the people who are the architects of decisions, work in the architecture of the decision, and delegating all formed and environments in all decisions.
For the first time I stopped, my friend, today he found a day to get there, his face is him, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior economy issue.
He looked at me and said, "Look, I found it's not fresh.
I told him, "Thank you, you have to bring the knowledge of the behavior economy to the digital world."
I'm a Brazilian juice who's going to have a flag for him, who helped me a lot in my way to see him and also talk to him.
I think we need a lot of research to know that we use a lot of cell phones.
Everyone here is a long-term teacher, dressed or looked at him, but I arrived at a research, for example, that he was a pictures for 22 hours, nearly, that you can add him to my grandfather.
So, among these 35 million decisions we made, how many of them had made digital decisions?
In these universities, it seems that we're using digital equipment, or that I've changed many times by looking at these none of us.
I'll start to ask myself about this: Is it that when I go to the UFRGO and research, where is the person, who gives me a lesson like me?
Is all of us going to study the country of the path we're going to talk about, and we put the "wes" and we put the "wes" and the "wes" story?
How many decisions are we trying to deal with the power to the digital world as abnormal?
It's good, it's Google, (Laughter) it's inequality.
Talking about two groups, I'm going to talk to you about another interesting number.
It's a wall in Austria, it's really great, and in the diagram it's equal to you.
As you can see, I didn't have to think I was a journalist and say, "Where are you going to have kids?"
(Laughter) Look, it's not strange.
Next range is my number of fingers and Europeans.
When I became aware of this number, I asked myself, "Why do we treat 99% of golden pain?
Because it's out that you're already in the worst.
You need to ask to leave.
In Dinabarca, you don't need to ask to enter.
So there's a magic word that's called "TFO".
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain Nascimento."
You need to ask yourself to leave.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there and go for it.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and then I had two options: one to receive the recipes and another to receive the offer.
The recipes were dismartened to the offers and they were killed.
So someone decided I wanted to go to Africa, I didn't want to go there and go out.
I picked up the offer and marked the recipe.
Uber has a new functionality, a Q, you can share the car with other people.
I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the culprit.
This is not to be able to go out if I was immersed in the people, and I thought it was cool to meet another person.
I talk a lot about Uber mountains.
They take the work they love to talk.
I decided to open a time and tell a story, and a lady chose the culprit, when she got to the car with another person in the car, and she looked strange and said, "I'm like this.
Is there another façage in the car?
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose the cube."
So, that's it.
(Laughter) So, little by little, I chose to be unable to know.
She chose what was already chosen for her.
It's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
If we do something today to research where people eat, there are 567,000 results.
What is a click?
91% of people explain in the rest of the first page of Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and I was the same, Google?
After that, what do I do?
I'm going to click on the website.
I love it for Jessé.
Here I see the side that has the page "No, I'll go to the 17th grade," you'll ask for it.
(Laughter) Actually, Google is Uber giving us a little bit of things.
These little birds, in English, have a name in the behavior economy as well as their name.
They are called inequalities.
It was exactly a little empurried in English.
I'd like to ask you to take a little bit of the person next to you, yes.
I don't know if you're here to do it... (Laughter) It's an ecology.
Right?
So, this is UNIC, you see?
There's a theory of a author called "Britteira," he has a book called Dante.
And the concept of "digitoland" is the name I gave to a simple way to understand these empuries in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood myself.
I thought there were adults.
(Laughter) But it wasn't.
(Laughter) (Laughter) You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, from Austreet in Detina Maca.
Everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
In this e-mail that a text written, "Aus inscribes, TEDx de uma pessoa," you're automatically realizing the power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life, then explain it.
And me?
(Laughter) If you don't want to be too low, you have to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were there?
More than 400 people written, 13 people stayed there.
So, this means that I build all these decisions of life of 300 and 70 conversations.
No, this is an experiment, it's one of the things I do.
I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I show other results.
Generally, people ask me, "Please have this knowledge of these discomforts, these dances, can we handle someone?"
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you have it, you can use it, you can use it, to do with a patient of diabetes, like, for example, leave the moment that is also insulin.
Or you can say, to avoid truck accidents like this doll called Smart, which makes the medition of the brain waves to detect the kitchen to prevent the accident.
So, in these 35,000 decisions, what I know has a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
There's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine that was this?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
(Laughter) Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone a concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of increased reality, virtual reality, learning machine.
And what I know is that the digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
And I believe that if we understand better how these problems work, how these signs work, we'll be able to build a better world, and we'll be able to be more aware for us to make better decisions.
Thank you.
(Applause)
