That's it.
How is the residuary of people with disabilities?
If there's any difference.
Or should it have, my role as an inclusive fashion stylist is to create a vestuary that embraces everyone?
People "com" and without disability.
Today I'm going to tell you why I work with this, and why did this issue work so much with me?
Everything started in 2009 when I was still searching for a topic for my work of conclusion and course.
And one day?
It happened to me a jury in a wheelchair.
And that's when I started to think about the subject for the first time.
How does he dress have a difficulty to put clothes, does it need help from someone?
Or is there interest in fashion?
And then, these things were in my head.
And I decided to do my work on this.
So I did a study to understand the implications and limitations of the vestuary for wheelchairs.
From then on, I talked to several women, including with parapletes that were in Porto Alegre at that time.
And they told me that yes, that all of them had interest in fashion, but almost all of them had the difficulty to find a vestuary that attended their needs.
So, many times they bought a clothes, one, two largest numbers, took them to the sewage to make some adjusts, and that made them lose the fall of the piece for a long time and lost money.
And many times they stopped using something they would really like because they knew that it wouldn't be good in their body.
After this work and these conversations, the conclusion I arrived ...
This vestuary was really necessary.
It was this: making clothes and my purpose as a stylist for everyone.
The first adapted clothes I did was Juliana.
It was from a desfile with other women without disabilities, and I did a pants with high-pitched things, elastic in the belt to make the proof of the probe that is very used because it uses wheelchairs.
I made a shirt, instead of buttons, I put veil to facilitate the dress's dress.
And in the back, there was no sewage and no resort to not form the stairs, which are offered by skin actress with some surface, and obviously I didn't put a scholarship in my back because it didn't make sense.
AC: This other challenge, I invited women with several types of disabilities to unfortunate with others without disability.
And I did it for Carlena, a blouse that had opening in the shoulders with pressure button, to facilitate, at the time, to go to the head, in fact, to be able to dress alone.
AC: In this last challenge I made, I invited men, women, with disability.
And for courtyard, I made a seat.
And, well-ergonomic, I've already done it in the sitting position to give greater comfort.
To tell him that it's visually impaired, I did a dress that she could use in many ways, on top to the bottom, below the top, reversible, and I wrote her name to remember him to identify that that that piece would be that user on the desfile day.
In fact, the ideal would always be to think about making label and label for people to have access to some basic information such as size and color of the play.
That's it, there's dynamism.
And for women, with ananism or lowest status, the ideal.
It's to think about pieces with an adult style, but with adaptations, so that they don't need to find the ideal clothes, childhood sessions of the shops, imagine clothes with princesses and colorful ones.
It seems to be a joke, but it's the reality of many people.
What excites me the most about my work is that I read the self-esteem of these people, they feel beautiful and valued, and this is very gratifying.
In Brazil, there are more than 45 million people with some disability, and this means more than 23% of the population, according to the data of IBGE from 2010.
But the good news is that companies are already thinking about more modern products, like colorful wheelchairs, stamped and are producing more technological products.
Did you know that it was in Brazil that we had the first fashion contest in the world that is already in the last edition, I participated in the third and made a party for Juliana?
And I took this second place.
"Me?"
Silvana.
Drika!
And many other people, several other stylists, small brands, are already adapting pieces in their schools.
That was already in the second inclusive collection, due to the size of the success that was the first, but it was out that the big companies, famous and conceptual brands, and the target also American, recently launched an inclusive collection.
We all have to think about it.
We must have empathy, look at others.
What about the world?
What's changing, people are more aware.
And fashion is also changing together.
Today, I'm here talking about inclusive fashion because I need to call attention to this topic.
But, in the future, I don't need to use this term anymore.
Because we will all be equal to our differences.
Thank you very much.
That's it.
I've got married with a name, I have two wonderful children.
And they were created thanks to two women who helped us in California.
To generate these children, they're very proud.
It's also my family, and very grateful, those women who helped us make this dream come true.
And to create this family: Two months ago, in the Sophie of Tancrède, or largest of 11 years, it was diagnosed with a melody and a leukemia.
And that puts life on the risk.
Imagine all the most and fathers you're here, as we feel.
Like a fear of losing your child.
(Laughter) And we had two options.
We don't know how to fly, cry, or resolve, fight, believe, faith, strength, and continue looking for a hatred to find out.
From then on, it was very incredible because all the most schools and all the larger friends, sharing the press, social networks, all the place, taking people, donating blood, medulating, very incredible, it was a very beautiful movement.
And all this movement made us think that another secret, through this disease, allowed us a very important message for all of us, the first for us and then for all the rest.
The first message was...
And when a child shakes you, and you have a risk of life.
All or rest of the problems of fears, of concerns, don't matter.
Everything else doesn't relate to you, it really matters.
And we learned to be this lesson and it spread to our friends, to the most in school, to society, people in Facebook.
I'm talking about truth, it doesn't matter what problems I had.
It doesn't matter, or the most important thing is life, the fight for life, and for love.
The second message that happened to this disease, so public, and all that movement of finding a donor.
It was that people saw us as a homosexual, a parental man.
It's not a family that's called, that welcomes, which is the same as all these families, because it's not the bottom.
It doesn't matter if we are two men or two women.
(Laughter) The important thing is to love the family, this union, this is to give the strength, that gives life, or a father of a mother to have a family, or a living father, or a father of a mother, to save my son's life.
And the third very important message I turned into with this disease to the world.
It's that my blood, my hatred, we were able to manufacture it.
It's our favour.
The blood is only painful, it's a human being to donate for another human, so it's also upset, this consciousness, we don't have that ability.
To give blood to those who need it, and they know it's not that.
For someone who has cancer in blood, blood is needed in births.
When we have an accident, at any moment, all banks are precise, and donating medula osse, driving as a medulator, the chances of compatibility.
Between a pain and a patient, it's from one over 100,000 people, so if you can save a life, it's as if you earn mega-senha.
In life, you can save in life, you can be a hero, me, when I get married, "Oh, for me, I'm a very beautiful moment to be able to wait for them to call me so that I can save my life, and it's the message that the tank happens to all of us."
I thank you all.
Well, supporting us for that union that we are not feeling that support conditioned, we are not going to save life as credit, but for having that consciousness that we all can donate blood and hurt to save lives and be superheroes, thank you.
She slept in Alaikon.
Paz, stop you.
Be it like you.
This is the exhaustion.
Two slams.
My name is Pala-La del Chinau.
His Syrian was born in Damasco, Syria capital.
In January, I studied at Damas' University.
Today I'm a refugee in Brazil, with my family.
My mother language is Arabic.
Or Araly, I'm a little...
In front of Portuguese.
That's it.
This is sorry!
Without some moments it's difficult to understand what I do.
Today.
And I'm going to talk about what bothers me the most: "Brochancetto," which exists on the slam.
Because of terrorist groups that have nothing to do with SLA.
A war chest.
To be a beautiful, calm, cheap, and easy to live in the population.
It was 23 million people.
I had my family, friends I knew about this child, three dozens of clothes: obscultory, engineering, two apartments.
I have a car in Damás.
(Laughter) He liked traveling.
And I loved to know the world, I went to the country.
AC: Like the United States.
(Audience) Spaniard.
AC: It's France.
Until one day the war started, March 15.
In 2011.
(Audience) Interal.
After that.
I say to all the other cities.
In the country, my mask city was the safer in Syria, there were between 20 and 25 bombs.
Borgia.
"That's it!"
Five years of war.
"My country is destroyed."
Let's see.
Those who know it were, thank you.
The road or the chain of their children, found their wives.
Spread and mutilated.
"Well, a bomb."
Familiaries.
It will sound and not come back.
My last years in Syria were very difficult.
And I didn't know.
I know and it's going back home.
When did you leave to work?
I know how to see my family again or not.
Today, millions of Syrian will be stuck, dead or refugee in other countries.
In my family, we were very sad when we had to leave Syria, because we, the relatives, and our life went back.
I still don't know if I'll be able to return to my country, my father, my brother, still live there, and I don't know if I'll live them again.
I stopped protecting my family, I went to Barabai Ruti.
After that.
Ten months.
It's about that Brazil had opened the doors for Syrian, so I went to talk in Baixada Brasileira and desert.
That São Paulo was the best city to go to Brazil, because he had more opportunities.
And you saw Pinas, or more week, "Brazilian Brastrada."
I was 40 years old.
From my life?
And start again in Brazil.
And I arrived here, in December 2013, with my family, two children.
Oriald, 11 years old.
It was like this: today I have a Brazilian daughter.
Sara, nine months.
In Brazil, I made a party to celebrate my children's birthday and everyone talked very well.
And I'll take advantage of it.
What is the kitchen?
Very well.
It's making food to sell.
That's when I created the Facebook page, "Hey, Syria, that's why now everything has a pen and paper.
Because it's a number, it's the accumulation.
And I do food in delivery.
Boru WhatsApp.
We are happy in Brazil, we thank.
The reception of the Brazilian people.
AC: You.
Open the pots.
When the world was closed.
Good evening.
Etress, who is at the end of the war and attacks.
I'm a tourist.
Many people.
I had an wrong idea.
It's about Syrian.
It's about Islam.
Today, tomorrow, here.
Or a journalist says, "Me?"
And then, what happened in France?
Now, I don't want to talk, talk.
The contact with a human person.
Let's do it!
I'd like blood.
It's allowed to kill the name of religion.
(Laughter) But exactly opposite.
The attack that happened in Paris was a crime, not so Brah Francesis, but also Branuse.
The Syrian, the Islamic State, is a terrorist organization that is emerging the image of the slam.
A basis religion, or Alcuron, I'm not a sacred book, that kills a person without it killing all men and those who read life.
It will be as if life, to all men, Alkurão, lasts your mother, Brás Polo, 32 hours.
These tourists don't respect the Muslims.
And they kill Muslims, Sunita, like me.
My life in Brazil showed me that we can live in peace.
In São Paulo, there was no type of fight between Brazilians and Brazilians, even with religious cultures.
When people come to a woman using Ri Jabi, that silence that covered my hair, like my wife, they ask me, "Why do you use this heat?"
And Silinson, at home too, Alenter Jabi, holds other rules.
Men and women can't touch me, but each person wants to buy, or not, but I've already seen some humans who do all this, except the voice of wedding, that kiss the same way they have been killed in alcohol drinks.
When I went to blood in Brazil, the doctor asked me, "If I drink alcohol or be a sex with more than a partner, is this not happening to me?"
"Why?"
Because those things are exhausted from isolation.
Our religion is very important for us.
But, despite not knowing Mozla, after the agency exhibits.
People always understand and respect, "The perfect woman says that we should respect all religions, that all people have the same value we should have, truth with everyone."
It doesn't matter if there are white, black or Indians, or it's slowly good that we have to help those who need, every year we have or Alsaacá and we give 2.5 percent.
of all our money for people.
More poor.
It doesn't matter if poor are Muslims.
Crystados, today.
And I invite you to learn more.
It's about Oislam.
I'm sure it was August.
Now, it's understanding what a religion is.
Now, my dream.
And in Brazil, the world knows better or islam.
(English)
Let's do it with "O" or "brecocent."
That's how my children.
And it's your child.
Wow, power!
To grow together based on it.
What is the molecule?
(Video) In the small stories of life, I come to recite my rhythms, I do food, in my living room, just like this race, I studied, but I'm here, I don't understand the opportunity to be seen, I've had a lot of hands, a cook.
Fascinera.
Why not hire me in the mall? I don't understand, if it were for the option, I have several friends who are in this situation and have already conformed, but I don't want to conquer new areas, please give me an opportunity, and the lunch told me, "You follow this corridor, go back, go to the left, go to the left, enter that little room, that the vast is just waiting, be welcome."
Well, this poetry I wrote in 2011, and I'll tell you why I wrote this poetry, today I came to talk about the Pagina's success, the page I created in Facebook.
The page appeared in July 2016 and, as I created this page, it wasn't programmed at all, I was at home, from vacuum, due to the daily race, sometimes not even time to think and see everything we've achieved in life.
So I got there one day, in the middle of my race life, and I was stuck there, I'm not talking about everything I achieved, my dream was to live near the beach, and today I live near the beach, almost in front of me.
And remember everything I achieved, there are also some memories of when I was a maid for seven years, and, as I use Facebook as a newspaper, I put everything that happens to me in the memory, some stories will start to bet on Facebook, and then I keep following that everyone wrote, always talking about the past.
For me, surprise, in less than 24 hours, this became very fast, and then, soon after I put my first story: my first story on the Internet was referring to my last job as a domestic in the city of Santo.
This, in 2009, I was hired to be a cook, I had to bring the workshops, I couldn't use her body at home and not the bathroom.
In her house.
What was the domestic bathroom?
But there was a day when this bathroom was broken, and there I stayed nine hours without being able to use the bathroom, and that was always said I was treated as if it were the family.
From that moment on, when I compasted this first story on the Internet, it became very fast, and then I felt the need to create the page because I started to receive so many stories I thought I would receive only last stories, and not stories of today, 2016.
The page has less than four months, as I've already said, has more than 4,000 accesses, more than 4,000 and a half, relating these stories, I give interviews to several media.
So much the international media, the national media, London babies, television and Germany, and many others.
What I was very surprised when I talked to these reputers, Vía Skype, who all of them got excited, and I started talking about these stories, because the domestic work, outside Brazil, has another symbolism, the most valued domestic domestics, they earn for hours, so totally different from our country, an announcement I read.
It was for the worker.
And working as a second, access.
And then, when I arrived at her house, I started to clean, the consumption of everything I've always done, and I've always liked reading, but, books, even today, cost very expensive, and my mother, domestic, spending for these oppressions, even in a single house, I found something that I call the human treatment, which is the Regina entered in the room.
I was nervous, maybe palid, I started to cry.
I was very young and I didn't know anything about life, I was very nervous, and then she started to indicate several texts in 2009 when I entered the university, I got to read in the university too, so what I call the "humanized treatment," in 2009 was very difficult.
Let's help the university.
With the gangs, because I entered the university, I was solved, I had to pay the monthly, and thanks to some teachers and various class friends who help me, I summarize some texts, I prefer to enter the room to make a test, which is still not over.
There are women working in situations "analogs of slavery," I wasn't the first to do this, I only used the Internet as a tool, but in this world, in Brazil, a woman called Lao Delina de Campos Melo, a black woman like me, and sponsor some stories.
People say, "Wow, it's very heavy, yes, today I came here to generate discomfort."
(Laughter) Because I believe that only through discomfort that we can change some things, no one will follow the path with a little stone in the foot, why?
And the majority of domestic workers in Brazil, 796% of According to 2013 are black women.
And that is it.
It can't be the only condition of black woman.
This place is a work like any one, yes, 53% of the population is also black, here in Brazil, and 79% are domestic.
This service can't be edited to black woman, why do I say that the sedentary service, my grandmother was domestic?
My mother was a domestic, and I was also a domestic, when I got to talk to my mother, that I would be a domestic, she started to cry because I was going to understand, but she already knew that everything she had happened while working in the family houses here in Brazil, I would also pass.
(Laughter) Because I took a long time to understand that curriculum with a good picture and a good appearance is never black.
When I understood this, I started to deliver curriculum.
Without photos, they called me, at least, a interview, took a suspicious of seeing my experiences, of having established this, and that's it, and then you're yourself!
I said, "Yes, or I'm magic."
(Applause) And I always say that what was the big house in the past are the apartments of luxury today.
What domestic slaves were in the past, and it's a past not having a distant, it's very close to us, it's domestic employees today.
The modern senzala?
It's the kitchen of employee.
She came running, running, and I was nervous because I was waiting for a long time to get there, "You're on the side of the payment, I listened there, entering the car, the noise of the key, opening the door, my pattern came.
And then, when I arrive, with the clothes away, only waiting for her to pay me, then she arrives and says, "Men, it was so boring, "Wow, I forgot to take your money, Monday Feira, I pay you."
The modern senior is the kitchen of the employee.
My girl, I grew up since I was little, with so much ice and affection, her mother would always work, I didn't have much time for her, but all the needs she'd spend and suffered was me who was there.
I only wanted to see her marrying, that's it, but unfortunately they didn't invite me for marriage, but, as I'm daring, I put my best clothes in the church, I stayed there hidden, and I put my girl married.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee, "I'm seeing my family of my dress patterns, everyone happy."
And I knocked a sadness.
Because it's Christmas and I'm not with my family.
Because modern senzala is the kitchen of the employee.
The worst moment of my life is when my pattern will work, it will work, it takes part.
His wife to work.
Tell it to his wife who's going to work, but he returns.
For the house.
To witness me.
And the only solution I had was to take copies of all adversities.
So, if I'm going to clean my bedroom, I get into it.
If I'm going to clean the bathroom, I trick myself, and so I can run away from his seeds, because when I say I'm going to change the job, my friends say, "Menina, resist, you get 1,800 Brazilian reais per month?"
"I'll never win this value in another place."
And I'm here resisting because I also left my children on the northeast, and they need this money.
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee.
I just got to the new service.
I brought my little pot of saving.
Because my little pot is my penic.
And then I was there.
And in the service line, woke up, I picked my little bit of soviet.
And this was the number one.
And my pattern saw, I was very scared, and she started to cry and said, "Why are you using the little door to know if the bathroom is happening, your bathroom can use the bathroom, and I didn't have the bathroom of the employee, that's why I brought little?"
Because the modern senzala ...
It's the kitchen of the employee, today I'm here, contrary to statistics.
For some people in my place, it would be in the faxine, because when I told my pattern that I wanted to study, do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Yes."
"Men, you have to be happy where you are."
For this attention, your grandmother wasn't a domestic, only the mother was also a domestic, is already predicted for her family to be seen.
So you have to be happy, being happy, so I'm here telling the statistics, the black woman.
Gorda!
Great!
Seriously!
(Applause) Women press, fat, teacher, peripheric and rage... (Applause) Oh, my side!
I'm not alone here today.
(Laughter) Later on, there are 6 million domestic women who should only have my side.
And that at some point they will be, everything I do would happen that my life is not thinking about money we don't have money.
But only to see that six million domestic women are being represented now, and that's what I want to provoke at this moment, because everyone here must have many patterns, several patterns, and some domestic ones, if each one gives this idea of talking, we will decrease a little bit of inequality in this country.
Because in other countries, many domestic ones work and study, and here, even this domestic work has as private property, we can see in the airports, why does the nanny know it's a nanny, but it's not to leave, of course, what are the places of some people in this country?
So I'm here to control the statistics.
AC: I'm not alone.
I'm talking about six million dolls.
It's one of the African Africans and unforgetted.
Let's go back.
[A.DE.]
I'm here today to talk about silence.
What is already a bit funny to leave.
But the only way to communicate is talking.
And I'll ask you, for the time of my talk, first to disconnect.
Take off your cell phone.
Not photographing, even because I'm dying of fear.
And if you're photographing my fear, I'll be even more uncomfortable.
What is the silence for you?
What is silence?
For us, human beings.
Take a say that silence is a entrance door for those who we are emotionally.
Because who we are emotionally is who we are, in fact.
If you don't allow yourself to look at yourself in the silence of your head, you'll never know who you are.
Four years ago.
I was in a table, in a surgical center.
And then, I was doing the 8th conceptive surgery in my eyes.
She was already very inflamed in the stage.
When did the cell start?
I was feeling a lot of pain.
And the doctor applied another anesthesia.
And then the pain didn't stop.
He turned to me and said, "Frecisco.
It's very informed, anesthesia won't catch.
Let's follow.
And I was almost 30 years old, yoga meditated more than 20.
From the top of my ego, I was sure I would agree.
It started.
Take your eye, open your paup, and it's safe, put your equipment.
Spread inflammation points.
The first past of the dress.
Wow!
At the time, the pain went to the next level, and I was sure I wouldn't agree.
And then, in the middle of this.
From this chaos, of this situation?
I remembered a phrase from a author.
He said, "The silencing is the entrance door for a state of the present."
When did I remember that?
After 20 years meditating, I discovered that I had never been present.
When did I put my foot?
In this feeling, in this moment of presence, which is the moment when you're not the consequence of what you've already experienced.
And you're not anxious anticipation of what you have in front of you, you're the human potential.
You don't have color, you don't have race, you don't have credit, no sex, you're a human being.
When I put my hair inside, guys.
What did I find?
It was fear.
Thank you very much.
It was very angry.
Well, it's in class.
And it was a lot of frustration.
I found several emotions, several emotions.
That I didn't know that I lived with a big mine.
(Laughter) They were the consequence of the story of everything I had already lived.
And then, the discovery was everything I had already experienced.
I was determining the way I thought, the way I act, the way I realized life.
I was determining my choices.
Now, little by little, I asked you to turn off your cell phone.
Remember?
Most of you.
He only stood his gold.
I'm going to talk about many of you.
Did you think?
I said, "No, I need it.
Others justified their importance, so now I really want to challenge each one of you to take the cell phone because all of you have it.
They hear me, "All of you have a cell phone."
And they delegate him.
You sleigh, come this step.
It's not to get rid of you, it's slow.
Disconnected from cell phones.
Put them on the floor.
Put your cell phones on the floor.
Put your scholarships on the floor.
And then, you go back, close the computer.
You, with the legs connected, close to them, and you who were notice each other, close your notebooks for a moment.
With all closed, you're not connected, you've taken close to you, the tool.
Stern of connection: those who connect to the human being.
Now?
Look at this environment where you are.
Look at the later walls.
Look at the ceiling, look back, look at the stage.
And then, look at the other human being you have the right and the left.
I said, "Let's look at the guy in this way."
I said, "You're fine, get even a kiss."
He was connected, guys.
Let's see!
Did you see where you are?
Did you see?
What did you see?
(Whispering) Listen, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, discourage your legs.
Put your hands and close your eyes.
Put your hands on your legs, the knees.
Now, of closed eyes.
Are they really closed?
Some of you will have a moment of resistance.
A resistance that is born from fear.
The man anyway isn't this guy in front of me, even because this guy, at that moment, is much more afraid than all of you together.
It's the real fear.
A fear of what's inside.
Fear of this emotional map of life history.
Look at them closed.
Give space with me.
Remember where you are.
Do you remember the walls?
Do you remember TED?
Remember the approximate dimensions of the room.
Remember that you're in the building of this university, in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil.
In Latin America, they locate themselves.
At this moment, we're connecting.
A natural and subutilized system.
From the human brain, we are connecting the space location system.
In the space vocalization system, even if you think you don't have it.
A strong direction sense?
There's a knowledge.
(Laughter) Do you know where you are?
And to know about your position?
And in the space location system?
We wake up a new function, a new area of the brain, at this moment, a different piece of mind of you is scending.
Knowing where you are and leaving the localization system?
Feel where you are, sit down the chair.
Do you remember, when you were children, you took a hand to the hot chicer, and soon you learned that a little before the hand touches the chicken?
You felt the temperature and took your fingers to the Chicara's house.
And in feeling, there's also a knowledge.
Now, with the system of connected vocalization and feeling where you are.
Observe.
And apply the space localization system to its minimum space.
The volume?
The area you occupy inside this room.
Think about the occupied area.
And then, more than that.
Feel it.
What makes the area you occupy?
I open my eyes.
Strange.
"No."
No, it's only new.
It's not strange, it's not difficult.
It's new.
It's new, it's new, inclusion, equality, there's nothing strange here.
It's you like you are.
To look inside and explore silence.
It's determined to realize that much of what we do is determined by what we've already experienced.
Look inside, it's in silence.
It's having a real freedom of choice.
Silence and a state of presence that decorates from it and that can become.
A habit in our lives is self-knowledge technologies that are on the planet, along with our evolutionary process for more than 10,000 years.
All of them are available are simple.
But it's the last generation technologies.
We already know that communication will be from the evolution of race, direct communication between what I feel and what you feel.
I came here today to tell you.
That you don't need to be afraid to disconnect.
Because the connection of fact happens when you communicate authenticity.
For another authenticity.
Symence is a source of freedom.
TEDxT.
Who has never gone through a TED talk that has had the first video?
(Laughter) And, normally, it's the first view, as my case was, I can say that it's an absolutely tough betrayal.
The walls are so seductive that the idea of translations ...
I'm from a demand of a legion of a TEDx fan.
What did they sell to bring to society?
(Laughter) From a shared way to their friends, their colleagues, their family.
(Video) (English) In the case of your Brazil.
The work of translation is essential once it appeals.
Five percent of people agree with the behavior of prediscity.
There's five percent less influence in English.
As soon as the translator thought he could have a door in this case of hope for millions of Brazilians.
Actually.
And we are almost 30,000 volunteer translators in the world.
And 10% of them are Brazilians.
It's been translated to 16 and young people and almost 6,000 translations made at the same time.
But we're only translated.
As we also see the talks made in events like these here.
The work of transcription is very important, not only to take our TEDx to the world, but to allow people with hearing impairment to accompany the content of the walls.
When the talk isn't given in English, my case was very Portuguese, the first one is transcribed in the original language.
To later be lost at the same time and, instead, it's that it's translated to make more beautiful.
Because, initially?
The TEDx with its own scientific logo, addressed subjects with entertainment, which is the "e" that we can translate as diverse, and designs the people to refer to, currently the talks add to an inferiority of subjects.
Another of my passions.
This year, what defines the subject is this event.
It's that it's terrible that we have after not only for our biggest life expectancy.
And also the reduction of human work's journey throughout history.
I think it's clear that one of the uses I do in my ferventive recipe is to translate and transcribe as a bubble false in the NGO of DET.
The TEDx talks can be the TEDx talks, the TV series, they're short educational videos, even children's children in a small one.
And I do this not only.
(Video) Because translating is a passion and passion is a key word in my life.
Not only because a pleasure to translate these talks, whether it's a TEDx, or a very anxious person, not only because I learn a lot with them, and that I remember that the translator is a privileged method, not only because a pleasure happens to me as a translator.
But not only because I had fantastic people, as I'm getting to know here in this event.
They are inspiring people.
But why do I think my theme is precious?
Because I think it's worth using my hearing excellence.
(Laughter) In this archives, like this.
That's what I want.
Second, it was cold.
I opened the promise of man in my life.
Audience: Yes.
I'm from light to silencing and become something that is empowered, that I don't have a doubt and education.
It's fundamental for them.
And I don't have a doubt that education is fundamental.
For people, less privileged, with good criminals, or excluded to our society can be inserted in a dignified way in our society.
And when I ask the volunteer job, I think it's a donation work, whether I donate if I have, whether I play your knowledge, to sweat an object.
And what if I work to volunteer?
(Laughter) Because if you don't choose mine, it's a mine decision.
And I have to do it in the best possible way and have to commit myself.
To donate the time that's left.
(Laughter) It's different to donate the works.
And the rest of the monsters.
The tradition is a complex activity that demands not only to know the foreign food, but mainly.
Audience: At our age.
And it's called "Fones," with young people.
It's a perfect translation.
There's always a dream of knowledge in the middle.
A lot of research.
There are many jobs.
A lot of verticalations.
And on the other hand, a simple translation to be like this?
There's always a degree that I've tasted.
And frustrated, with facts, what?
Because better than it makes us, he can always do it better.
Because the text can be improved almost in definition.
And here I need to remember that the great majority of our volunteers isn't professional, and this is very important to decide, we'll make the majority.
But, despite this, we create the quality of our history.
(Applause) Not only in respect to the speaker, but in respect to those who talk.
And to guarantee this humanity, all translations and transcessions?
They go through a revision made by their own volunteers, so they finally be approved by a coordinator or a coal coordinator.
Or, as we call it, "Yes."
And in the case of Brazil, in the Brazilian Portuguese, in the despair, we got Portuguese Portuguese Portuguese, which is very different.
And we have ten NC, which I'd like to mention at least.
Narrator: I read stories.
We have six pieces, we have Marisene, Claudia.
Why me?
I have our parents.
And it's because of my nose, Gustavo.
The owner, or the sun.
What's the guy doing?
The world is OK.
This obsession I have with education?
PA: Actually?
(Audience) I've heard it.
AC: Not only.
With Brazil, which lives a deep, political crisis, that the education is connected to the bread, but without even my own personal history.
My father, who, today, had been two years old, got hurt for primary course.
(Laughter) Despite that, I knew how to write very well and make the four procrastinations in mathematics very well, and his dream was to always be able to study further because I was studying and make some studying children.
(Laughter) That's why the one who lived in our little kitchen called Tairobeiras.
(Laughter) He decided to change his four children at the time, I'll go to many slides, the biggest city we live in.
In some sides, my father had come from his beginning to his elderly logic, and his site also established, as a commercial, he had a material in a presence store.
(Applause) At the moment.
In 1964, there was a great presence in Brazil, due to this reception, and other reasons, my father went to the talk and lost absolutely everything, he was, literally, without anything, that I was being killed in the cells.
One felt the humiliated feeling of his father, according to my father, decided to pay his degrees.
And if changing for Belo Horizons as a cold behind, eating well liked to go.
The first horizon.
My mother, who today has been around 40 years old, isn't it?
(Laughter) Besides being an asteroid for Paráito, there are still eight jokes per hour.
It wasn't an excellent kitchen, it was a warning warning warning wedding, and it decided to make a ticket to sell, so for many years, in my house, wherever these passages were from the worst storms in the horizon.
So, despite not having to eat many times, I don't have to dress from one thing that my father and I didn't give up, it was that we were destroyed to study.
And so it was done.
The big fact, without a doubt, because it's already agreed with data of the national research for samples and homicides.
In the faster of 48 years, at 68 years old in Brazil, only 32% of the largest personality in 5%.
And this obsession, this fascination, this passion that my father had for education, disappeared.
In the Middle Ages, my father, for example, had a very placed habit.
Understanding, when I was seven, at that time, we were going to college entrance exams.
And a vocalist thinks, "There's no problem, there's no bubble, there's any visit that has to be in jail."
(Laughter) You can imagine, and then I'm entering, tropicizing in the words.
Today, I'm thinking that this should be the greatest pants in the park, right?
But for my father, he was hurting me, shaking, without knowing, he was having a little in this talk here, anyway.
(Laughter) I, my five siblings, managed to overcome, but we got more than this today, we managed to give our children better conditions than we had, and here I tell my greatest passion in my life, in my beautiful opinion, which are our children's productions, Daniel, Rio Grande Lique, which are the ones I've never put all night long.
In the stories before all, it was a adventure that was always a pleasure for me and four of my children.
Coincident that, regarding or not, four of us, my brothers, become teachers, education is being a sick one.
(Laughter) At some point in physics.
(Laughter) And one of the brothers is the main educator for me, fantastic, creative, ideas, revolutionary, that applies in education of the students their own school.
So, the only message I can leave today is that we need to do it.
In education, in obsession, we have to be obsessed with education.
Despite our limited conditions, despite developing in our country, education has a priority inside our house.
And my passion with initiative is the TEDx, just like my father, was a simple manager, inspired us, just like today, was inspired by these marvelous speakers.
The TEDx inspires us.
And to spread the idea.
What makes us believe?
Think about everything.
We can.
AC: Our aunt, the voice, is blind, and it was with it that she had in our first contact with Braille, an alphabet where she can feel the things written.
During the vacation, we spent a afternoon with her, where she explained how she worked, showed us the letters, the numbers, the symbols, and then she taught us, but it didn't work very well because it was super complicated, I started to write the letters from dots to my notebook.
I ended up leaving my notebook and my agenda of music lyrics, film names, I did this many times, and I also exchanged several cards that showed me the release, and I ended up memorizing the alphabet, and I wrote it to her that I was learning, and gave me tips.
With this, in the passing of the first second year, we discovered that we could participate in a "makers" course in the "Cross School," and we thought that maybe Braille could give an interesting project.
So we started to think about ideas that we could create from what taught us, and we decided to create a clock where we could feel the time.
We started researching, learning about robotics, programming, and nothing happened, but we wrote everything, disconnected and collected everything, and we started to work, and, more or less a month ago, we ended the clock, and we saw that there was no Internet, and we decided to create something to help others from what they were for us.
The whole process we spent met a new language, all support, the values we received from our aunt, our friends, our family, showed us how important it is to develop our own interests and use them to create a change in the world.
Obviously, we see that it's something that was born from our interest.
It could help in the kitchen inclusion and potentially many other people.
This has shown us how necessary it is to have an revolutionary idea, but it's important to have a vision of my improvement that you want to create.
With this, we were committed to keep studying and researching to create an impact even bigger.
So we wanted to show a video, we had, besides the horse in the clock, feeling the pines.
And let the message that many things seem very simple: they haven't been created, and if even us, two students from high school, who haven't even ended up in high school, we're second year, and we're teenagers, we've managed to create something innovative, there's still a lot to be done to help.
Let's ask you a question.
What do you hide?
There are adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships with other adult people.
Maybe we don't.
Okay, we're all agree.
Two or more adults.
In a free and consent, they can have sexual relationships.
And that's what happens in prostitution.
Or in sexual work, which is the expression I prefer to use.
The only difference, the main difference with sexual relationships that are commercial, is that there's a motorcycle exchange.
In other words, there's a sexual relationship with the aim of having profit.
There's another part with the goal.
It must obtain pleasure.
And there are thousands of people who do it, I know some hundreds.
Men.
There are women who manage their business in an autonomous way, publish their announces.
They receive their clients.
In apartments, in hotels.
There are street pensions.
And they don't have anyone to explore them.
This is what I'm here to talk about.
And I'm not going to talk about cases that involve children.
Or adults that are correct.
The failure that involves us at 16 or adults who don't feel that their consent are cases of crime.
These are cases that must be followed, criminal and judicially.
I said, "Yes."
The delinquents must be condemned.
In fact, I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about child prostitution.
The child's sexual emertion.
And even in the case of the prostitution of adults who are forced, which is coaged, there's also a criminal case, and, therefore, it's inherent volunteer institution and forced institution.
But we're also not going to talk about traffic situations for sexual action.
According to the depth of prostitution.
Contract sexual exploration, but taking all the people who make prostitution for victims of sexual operation is confuse.
A small part.
It was as if it were all.
Investigations have shown that Portugal falls, the phenomenon of traffic for sexual exploitation is few possible, in fact they are phenomena that we identify, but that can be included.
And to have a notion of what I've just told you, that the field of the phenomenon is not possible, I'll give you the observatory data about human traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic, which is the State organism that changes the river, the information about human traffic issues.
And that there are relatively two thousand accesses, which are the last available data.
It indicates that they were Portugal confirmed 118 victims of traffic.
It's human.
What do you do for likely exploration?
In other words, victims for sexual duration.
It's just three.
Of course, I was going to hear a single victim.
To justify a judicial action.
What doesn't justify is that it creates a whole speech and a half.
What are the results of reality?
There's a very historical image in relation to prostitution.
Many times people take all the people who are in prostitution, like victims.
I'm very happy.
It's structured.
What's waiting for someone?
I wanted salvae.
And this doesn't correspond to reality, or is it just a stereotype?
Most people who are in prostitution don't consider the victim.
And he considers that he made an option.
Of course, we know.
Also everyone has the same options.
The world is extremely unfair.
There are structural buildings such as gender inequality.
The inequalities between rich and poor countries that make so many people immigrate economic inequality.
There are social and cultural inequalities.
We know there's a diversity of constraints.
What influence the decision's decision.
But when we talk, when we interview, when we find it.
Investigator, I interviewed conversations, I'm with the people who do sex work.
What they say is that they're an option, a standard option after the advantages.
And disadvantage that is entering an activity that is profitable, but that is highly witnessed and not recognized.
What if I ask you to think about the image you see immediately?
Sure.
It's when you think of a person who prostitute yourself.
Think.
And I bet most of you have thought of two situations, or in any previous one, or even in a woman.
It's a sort of bad aspect.
And from Ministry, who's in a corner, in a dark street, in the city, which is very likely to the operating boat and that, of course, has someone to explore it, but there are only two stereotypes, they are simplified images that don't reflect with rigor.
That's the reality.
There's a very big diversity of people who are in sex work.
There's a diversity of people.
Of practices, of experiences, not all of us have positive experiences, but not everyone has negative experiences.
And life trajectors are not just women.
They are not just women on the street.
There are men in sexual work, and there are women driving, there are not only women driving, there are also many transgenic women in sexual work.
For example, when our image is equipped with us, we think about the prostitution from it.
Does anyone in the street?
And I tell you that the studies that are made fuel.
And the identity is identified.
And they try to estimate the number of people who are at the beginning of the century.
Plete Saint-Drop.
What will it represent?
There are only 10 to 20% of the total of depositing people.
And when we think about a woman.
We're forgetting men who do sexual work.
Are they less?
It's just minority, but they're not negligious.
Let's give the data of the study.
It was done here in Portugal that had a greatest sex worker, a study led by Lisboa's preservation and that interviewed 140 workers, both in the context of the street, as in the countryside, men, women, trans people, and in all the country, and found 10.2% of men.
And now, 7.8% of trans women.
And there are still studies that tell us that in other contexts, this percentage will be even more elevated.
So, when the speech does.
about the victim of a man or a teacher.
Forget it if it's a percentage of men who are.
FD: In sexual work.
I'm going to talk to you about an idea that has been very veiculated here, in Portugal, highly.
And, although, it may seem an apparently humanist idea, when it's analyzed, deep down, because it has had very negative consequences for people who do sexual work.
And what is the idea of the client's criminalization?
In Sweden, since 1999.
That it's not.
It's forbidden to sell sex, but it's about buying sex.
The idea is at the base of this law.
It's that people who are in prostitution are victims.
Without exception and, therefore, if they are victims, they are victims of an oppressor or the client, and therefore, we're going to criminalize their behavior.
This law has already been adopted in other countries, after Sweden, and the Sweden government has talked about the great success of this law and how it decreased the prostitution.
But there are very strong evidences, in the midst of non-vernamental organizations that are on the ground and that work every day with people who talk about sexual abuse.
And they tell me that this law puts in greater rhythm.
There are the own dry flavors who put rich people to know how to drive.
And that increases its vulnerability, the violence.
There's the stigma and the disease.
Another idea we have is that all people.
That this idea of all people who are sexual work are.
They are victims.
Hmm...
It's an idea that, without big inspiration in picks, happened to people's resources.
And this is the idea that the client has a criminal.
It's an idea that seems ideologically invested to me.
Until research has shown that relationships between workers of sex and clients.
They are complex relationships and that mostly are arrested relationships.
But there's a kind of client that I think shows perfectly how this law is.
This idea of eliminating clients is dehumane.
They are people.
What are differences of disability or people with functional diversity, or another kind of diversity, as it's more correct to say, and that go through gender professionals.
This personality is a human right.
People who have disability.
It has the right to its security and its pleasure, and many of them can make it go through security professionals.
There are even countries.
What has the legal figure, which is assistant, sexually, is someone who receives to know how to have sexual relevance of this work, about the relevance of sexual work, and now that destroys any argument that tries to be in favor of the criminalization of clients.
So, if people?
You can do this as an option.
I don't know if people think it's the best option in that moment of their lives to face their economic needs.
Why do we keep, if this can be done, if this can be done?
Without violence.
You can be done everything.
It controls the connections of work if this can be done without more exploration than in the work activity, why do we continue to condemn so strongly the people who do this activity?
Why do we continue to disrespect sex workers?
And my answer is:
Because of moral, and specifically moral, sexual, that divides sexuality sexuality in two types, on the one hand, has a sexuality and it's considered legitimate.
It's normal and natural.
And we have a sexuality and it's considered illegitimate.
I say, "It's normal, anti-natural, and that's when the beginning of the sky is placed."
The fact that this century is considered illegitimate, anormal and anti-natural, is at the base of stigmatization, of social description, of the sanction of people who do this activity.
The stigma is a brand with deep spirit.
The stigma that rejects the sex researcher is very strong, it has many consequences.
The stigma dehumanizes: stigma is a form of violence.
It's at the base of so much discrimination about sex observers, like, for example.
When they drive in institutions in the health area of justice and social security, they are treated with prejudice.
And I'm going to say this in another way.
Now, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever used this word "no TEDxBas," "The puta stigma."
It's the worst that can fall on a woman.
The biggest offense we can drive in a woman is called puta.
The stigma of "puta" divided women in two types, tied and tired, seriously and non-serious, which behave well and behave badly.
And in that sense.
The stigma of puta.
It's an instrument that is at the service of control of feminine sexuality, it's a kind of lady's sphere that is above the head of any of us.
Any woman knows that if they have a sexual behavior that is divided, the norms that are sexually restricted.
The freedom of being stigmatized by puta.
Any woman knows how to steal the risk.
It can be called puta.
It's so cool.
Why do I think we can do any of us?
It's so that they don't continue to disrespect blind founders.
And I think the path is one of the human rights of all and included people who do sexual work.
It's the path of the construction of political based on scientific evidence, and this has already been talked about tomorrow in scientific evidence and empirical evidence, and not political built from ideological assumptions.
And it's also.
To recognize this group as a group that has been historically oppressed and fight against the end of this option.
To challenge the stigma, as I'm here doing at this moment, and to give you voice, to hear the sex workers.
I'm going to give you a group that has been.
There was something of the most attempt to see silencing throughout time.
The secret employees.
So, for everyone, organized and used 70, but possibly because of stigma, their voice doesn't have credibility, they're not heard.
In other words, we don't want compassion, we don't want tolerance, we want rights, and that's what I think we have to follow.
But after all this.
And to finish?
Do you think it makes sense?
It's natural that we must continue to disrespect.
Sigmatize and criminalize sex employees.
Thank you.
I have a bad news for you.
Medicine to health.
But there's good news too.
We can cure it.
Art, well cured, art, cured of being a doctor.
It's supported by a fundamental stone, in the medical relationship.
This relationship is a very delicate relationship, but at the same time, I have to have a vital distancing that allows me to have a technical rigor, to have a technical judgment, and so that I can add the best treatment for that individual.
This balance is very delicate, and the urban relationship with our time, with all the most superficial and rare, I'm this equilibrium suffering in the last 10 years.
I was in Amazonia more than 25 times as a surgeon.
In these trips, I followed many doctors who were also there in different areas.
When we got there, in our arrogance of...
It's a white invitation, I thought I'd take something to him.
But I didn't wear the Indian, the Indian told me that.
When I said, I found a feeling that I didn't have since childhood to relate to someone who needed to know how to do and to offer that person that involvement to that love, that attention there.
He's extrapolated.
Audience: Yes.
I used this convention, the request of floor and hours.
Honorans, Honorans.
All the doctors who go with us and focus on there.
And Rockist?
And we bring to São Paulo what we bring to another daily practice.
The simplification that runs there can be replicated here too, it's the mouth that doesn't need to go to the middle of the Amazon, that's all this, it's the path I found to cover.
We have a study that shows that at the beginning of the medical college, if you make a list of objective to the students, the first objectives are.
Altruism is fine.
These same students, at the end of the medical culture, with the same research, the tops of the system: success, recognition, cure.
Some time we did it wrong.
Because we got someone who had a brilliant poet.
And we delivered someone in technical, who knows a lot about medicine, but didn't know anything about people.
That's it.
The action?
The old relationship with the patient, a medicine, goes back to the past, in Greece.
Because it's the weight, in medicine, where the father, in medicine, which is the pop.
I don't want to say that medicine wasn't made.
When Adão, in Gasboa Maçã, Eva desengastated this, was to make a perveous trip, it's what we do until today we don't touch the same thing.
So why is the address considered, instead, to define me, and why your father teaches me why for the first time?
He had a method there.
It can.
The art of courage, something that can be taught, learned, reproduced, replicated.
And, in a way, the involvement of these people had a logic.
In that occasion, it was also developed, it was created a Pope's isolation.
Because even today I've used medicine shapes for the world.
It was done in a state of 80 BC.
I'm a photographer.
I'm going to talk to the media, and you've prepared three words.
In all the houses that entered.
I just talked about the benefit of the diseases.
Exiting a whole volunteer and corruption, especially the seduction of women, men, children and beings.
That's why what they saw, respecting the life of the sick people, in the exercise of my profession, or outside of it, and that they don't convince that they're lawyed, they'll keep silent as a religious secret.
And if I respect this judgment and didn't hear it there.
It would be the title of repution of men in all times, and if the transgender goes to the violin that happens to me, why, already in the collection, if you worry about this, and still today, you do a training?
Because we have to be transcribed, because the best patient's relationship is essential for good care, so it's.
Today, few things are registered by the UN's judgment, and in this case, I've had a honor to participate in a profession that is registered by a pioneer.
The medical knowledge in Greece is an individual.
It produces science in a way that the next could go further.
What happened to this, the medical knowledge that proliferated in a way that the individual is no longer capable of absorbing all this knowledge?
So, today, a patient has a lot of doctors who take care of a class, and this class is taking care of a little piece with this, encouraging this and losing the cure of the patient.
There's a running theory that says, "The exam can talk about the patient, it can't.
Once I was in a class in college, in a group of small people, as a teacher.
And I tricked the patient's processes, I took graphs, resonance, and we copied the ultrason.
If I look for your hand in your belly, it's not in case of consciousness.
(Laughter) "OK, I also have the composer, the guy calls me and says, "Let's see the network like this."
That's it.
We had to tackle the patient's finger and removed what was smoking inside and didn't smoke anymore, the hole of the fifth time showed he had a magician.
The mothers on Earth.
It's crazy, you can see if it's building care.
That's it.
The South River can talk a lot about the time you're wearing a patient, and there's a moment of intimacy, he can remember something he didn't tell you about the consultation, and he said, "If all of this to convince you?"
Besides, as you see in the patient.
You're here to answer the vulnerable area, you're telling you to extend me.
And at that moment, you have the opportunity to say, "It's not verbally for him, that you have taken care of him, that you're mixing the black because you want to do the good, that you're asking him, leave the care of you.
This relationship is this magic, it's not just beautiful to selfie, but it's replicated in science.
Children, yesterday, aren't Christmas, who are caught in the choir, are appealed better, but Apple has a higher highest range for harassment.
More and more, a number of functional diseases increase, our means, the same functions, but we don't know why it appears.
There's no exam operation, there's no Einstein's interaction, there's no reason, the diseases have a symptom.
And what happens if it happens because our society is a little sick?
Some of you have already told me, it's very nice.
It's very interesting to talk about the patient's relationship, but to be a patient's medical relationship, I'm a patient, and to be a passive patient for those who are talking to me.
Because you're not going to talk about a medical group.
Because, in the end, the act of relationship is not merce.
It's time for us to stop and think that there are two areas.
There are the doctors against the two.
It's time for us to stop and think that we're passive, and we have to take our hands, that was in our curve process, but also by developing your cure process, in the decisions of this curve process.
Let's do it.
The first point, the most important thing, is information.
When we're talking about Doctor Hugo, who's fashionable, when I was a child, there were many copies, there's a lot of health, there's a content to say, "Today, a Google, you have a great information lesson, a lot of good and very important thing, but many, many of us need to know, first."
So, the mouse really liked it.
I have a blog, in my blog, only 1 to 3% of people inside my curriculum, but you know who I am, and this gives me a huge chat because people get there, because this puts me equal to other people who are defending personal interests, money, and selling media or other things like this.
So, the signature, the second very important thing: it doesn't believe that society will hardly have a conscious laboratory, it will have an immediate discovery, without the society to be matured and it's done, so there's no way to discover, tomorrow, it's on the Internet, and my mother, when I don't know, silly.
Third, if there's something a bit paranoid, like the industry, there's no interest you're going to be, you shake, nobody dominates information.
It's hardly someone with interests and exclusions behind, so these things don't stop me, it's not a president, and finally.
Take the solution, discuss your doctor, he's there for that.
The information, in the same knowledge, catches information, participatively from its cure, information and information, is a knowledge knowledge knowledge, but dispute to the consumer.
The second very important thing to be active in the nation of the process of cure is to ask, demand, "When you talk about your doctor, do you have the right to know what the kid remedies?"
If there's a right to know the risk of that surgery, you can't say, "Oh, a public hospital, the guy doesn't have time to understand me, I work 20 years later."
I know it's time, but I don't think this will change the day to night, but I don't have the culture to change, the culture of...
To exist is not to get there fighting with everyone, it's not a teacher, it's not that.
(Laughter) Followly, OK?
And there is, if composing with time, we'll go.
And to make the atendments be different.
The doctors want this.
They want to have the right.
They don't want to have this attempt, or at the same time, they want to have it with chaos.
Once, I was in Amazonia, in her tennis, she was in Montoniosis, in her area and her mother, who we had a patient there, who had cancer.
It's with humor.
Let's see.
And there was no neurology for us to bring to São Paulo, to be treated here in the field.
And after all the years, I had the opportunity to accompany his trash, it was still, I didn't speak Portuguese, the doctor, obviously, didn't speak Germany, had a translator, it was the son who said very good at Portuguese, as it was very bad.
He was really scared, and I presented a enjoy that would give me a scene of a movie.
The Indius, the biomedical, you know this.
Yeah!
That's it.
The doctor was there.
Thank you.
That's it.
(Laughter) So, I'm wanting to say that, at that moment, magic happened.
That individual?
Without talking about language, without having a completely different culture of others, delivered your soul, that other individual, had all the interests to take care of it.
This magic, which is the art of going to cure, so you don't need to tell a lot, a lot of figure happens.
At that moment, we talk, I have the pride of thinking that there are doctors waiting for teachers, and that are, at least, in ambulants, in consultants.
Doing.
We're fighting for the good student, curating.
It's taking care.
So, we, old.
We can try to find more unity in our treatment, more compassion, and all patients.
Try to be active in your pure process, because it's not doing, because of a connection, and the world is better, and you'll be more disappointed about it.
Good evening.
I'd like to start with a world here: 35,000.
What are you doing in this environment?
AC: This number is the number of decisions of the human being drinks every day.
And if it gives more or less a decision every two seconds.
There are people, two, those who don't stop making a decision for those who have been prepared to talk about this.
The decision-making talk I'd like to tell you about a story that changed my way of seeing one of the decisions changed my way of making decisions.
The roots of the journalist had three innovations in this nature.
It's a digital nature with 59 dolls.
A journalist's structure prizes the citizens' brain that has a slightly digital treatment, but printed by also being a citizen.
The respect of this experiment is that the majority of people chose how they are the main ones.
What I really like with these experiments is that they usually believe in two groups.
For the second group, it was only two options.
Narrator: Gital Motion, 58 workers.
And we're talking about how 22 institutors too.
And very interesting is that for this group of people, most of this, I looked at a digital option.
When I talk about these experiments, I'd like to ask you, "What's the notion of the middle of series and 25 dollars about printed evolution?"
No one chose it.
What did this option change most people's lives choose in the egg?
And this left me very uncomfortable.
With what I wanted more to dance, I would make this decision.
I studied a lot about this, and I started studying about it, and I discovered that this person is seeing and even a man.
She looked at me and said,
It's a song that is placed in an equation to influence the issue of a decision or another.
I learned a lot about this in a theory called Economics and Computamental, for the theory that studies cognitive and neuroscience applied to decision-making.
I created a little interesting form, you can see.
MA: But you have two options to the idea, and you want people to choose the option T.
In other words, you already know the least to see the option, this is the middle of her, makes your CD to be better, for what I'm going to pay for 122 hours.
AC: Our company, if I like to have two, at the same time.
This is impressive because I started questioning myself why I did all this.
And a talk that, by the way, made the Internet all over, was a talk that made a comparison.
And these behaviors are today's illusions.
I think everyone appears in the countryside.
The sifth Alasudoras Adele looks a little bigger than the south of the Nathire, agree?
Because I return to what we see in a different way, the truth is that it's in the same size.
But we see that it's a different way, because I've got back to influence, there's another improvement that I've been fascinated by listening, which is this one.
The hope is to need the cradle on top.
They are equal to low chess pieces.
(Video) Narrator: It's the same life that you're going to make the problem, before you review everything.
But I'll show you what it is.
Without affecting the pieces, we only see that they are really good.
When I saw this presentation, it's better to understand that it makes some sense to say that it has return to us, it really evolves, it has to influence the door we see, the two.
What has returned to the brain is the whole decision.
I work in technology.
And I didn't know how to live working in a project to create an application through safety.
There were some of those who wanted to be happy.
It's a lot of option and life will not be available.
After choosing these two dreams, these three, or these two.
And it will never be true, safe.
Because we were working, but they said 500 km of possibility of choice.
The work team was working and putting a way of sacrifying this choice to people, this way was to have another profession, if the person was in the orchestra, she would add these three options.
If you think you're going to believe it, you'll see these three reasons.
It was, at the same time, enjoying this, with the concept of the journalist of Economists.
(Laughter) I started to realize that there are people.
What they make the drawing of the architecture of decisions, where I work with decisions.
In the World of Economics, there's even the name of this profession, called YOEX, and this led me a lot of lessons, which are the architects of decisions, work in the architecture of decision, drawing all formed and environments in all decisions.
That's why I came to my name, if today I found a day with this guy, this guy from HRL, he's the person who is a guru in this behavior economy, and he told me, "Look, I'm going to talk to you about Rio Grande do Bem, and he's going to talk with Denary."
I really wanted to change my way of seeing the behavior.
But she came to a research to know that we used a lot of cell phones, that everyone lives in the third larvae, dust, or look at her, and she thinks we don't need much research.
AC: If you have some people who have a smartphone, there's something like 22 hours a foot.
It's necessary for you to be with your advice, to go to the mood.
So, in these 35,000 decisions we make, how many of you think are digital decisions?
The Egyptian cities appeared in Rosa Egyptian Egypt, in the middle of the cities of the United States.
I started to ask myself all this.
Is it that when I come to this horizon and eat a person, I take this lesson like me?
Is all of us going to study the 8-school for friends, and we say, "We'll have a mask, what will happen if we don't have a Wesi and that's one of those who are good?"
AC: How many decisions do we treat by dealing with power?
For me, the need for us is "waste," it's Google.
You need to identify it.
Talents of the industry should talk to you about another interesting number: it's a number that in Austria, it's 91%, and in Genamata, it's 4% - I'm here to ask you what it was, and I'm saying, "I'm the number of books."
Thank you.
(Laughter) In this case, it's a number of two pieces of work.
When I became aware of this number, I asked myself, "Why don't you have 99% of young people, because in Austria you're already a teenager?"
You need to ask to leave.
In Dinabarca, you don't need to ask to enter.
So, there's a magical word called defeat.
This word is what you're already doing nothing.
These are the decisions I call "decisions of Captain d'Ascimento," you need to get out.
Some people already have this desire for you, you have to go there to leave.
I was putting credit in my cell phone these days, and there are two options: one to receive the principles.
And the other allows me to receive offer.
The recipes were dismartened, the offers were killed.
So someone decided I wanted a party and I didn't want to go there and go to the website.
What to get out of the offer's mark and the recipe mark.
Uber has a new functionality: you can share the car with other people, I opened Uber, I was there already marked to get the cube.
This is the "no" I asked him to leave if I was really in the people and until then.
I thought it's cool to meet another person, but I talk a lot about Uber motorcycle, I don't know if you take the work they love to talk.
And then, a Uber track tells me a story.
And one lady chose the culprit.
When the guy arrived, there was another person in the car.
And she looked at this strange and said, "Wow, there's another passage here?"
He looked at him and said, "That's it, he chose the cube."
(Laughter) And I said, "Well, that's it.
So, little by little, I chose to be without even knowing.
She chose what she was already chosen for her.
Isn't it?
It's very complicated, this is very interesting that we imagine who these decisions are.
AC: If we're in Google today to research today as a person, there are 5.67,000 results.
What's the energy we click?
91% of people explain in the state of the first country in Google.
Would we choose a place where people eat, and the same was Google?
After that, what I do: I'll read a click in the nurse page.
I love PVC, I see from there what parents don't go to the right page.
So I decided to go on.
In fact, this is Google, Uber, giving us a little bit of little things.
AC: These English taxes have a name in the behavior economy, they are called "dinities."
Not that it's exactly an English push, I'd like to ask you to take a pharmacy in the person next to you, don't realize what you're doing, you're a little ecology, you're a cell phone, there's a theory.
He has a book called "The Bridge Teller."
And the concept of "digitaland" is what I gave, in a simple way, to understand these little bonds in the digital world.
And the funny thing was that once a person went to my talk, and at the end of the talk came to me and said, "Now I understood, I thought, "I want to go."
(Laughter) In this talk, I created a picture, and it was important to see.
AC: You're thinking that only those who fall in this is European, Austria and Detina Már.
And everyone here received an email of TEDx confirmation.
In this email that a text written, "Aless insert yourself in a person, you're automatically taking power of all your decisions that you're going to take in your life."
(Laughter) "Shut up!"
And if you don't want to give up, it's enough to stay in this link and ask you to leave.
How many people were beautiful?
There are more than 400 people written.
(Laughter) Three people stayed there.
(Laughter) So this means that I consume all the decisions of life of 360 conversations.
(Laughter) No, this is an experiment, according to the things I do, I do these experiments to understand how people behave and I show other results.
Genome is people who ask you a fable?
To have this knowledge of these little birds?
Doctors.
And this can make us manipulate, right?
And my answer is yes.
The danger of this is that yes.
Knowledge is a tool.
If you're there, you can use to do what someone buys something she doesn't need, or you can say, "OK, like, for example, leave the right moment, it's even more harmful."
Or you can use to avoid truck accidents, like this doll, the same athlete, which makes the medition of the brain waves to detect a crop to edit a accident.
So, from these 35,000 decisions, I know there's a lot of decision to be taken, and I know that more and more we make one of these decisions in the digital world.
AC: There's an event that happened in 2016 that made people in the world 144 billion steps.
What did you imagine it was like that?
The launch of Pokémon Go.
Because Mongor is a game that brings the tone the concept of increased reality.
More and more, we are immersed in this world of virtual reality, virtual learning, machine learning.
And what I know is that digital world is increasingly present in our lives.
What do I believe?
Who was the one who understood better?
How do these puppets work?
We'll be able to build a better world.
We'll be able to build better interfaces.
And we were able to be more aware for us to make better decisions, thank you.
