I want to start with Nelson Mandela, in the great heroes of our time, who said that the true character of a society is revealed by the way I treat their children. But in Brazil, we are living paradoxes. Our children are what we have the most precious, we want the well-being to any cost, we give them our lives, and, however, our children are being very bad treated for society. In fact, this demands a reflection and demands that we can change. I hope to do a little with you today. If we think about the poorest children in Brazil, which is the majority of the criteria of Mandela, we are a terrible character, because we deny basic letters such as health, housing, food. We treat them with violence, and if they rebel themselves, we offer them the prison. But even for privileged children in your social position, well-carded children, children and daughters, who are here, things don't work well either. We committed, maybe, not smaller crimes. I want us to make a small trip about seven capitals that our society is starting as a childhood. And we'll take the wave of Gabriela, a child from middle class, starting with her pregnancy, trying to understand these husbands. The mother of Gabriela wants to have a natural birth, that moment of link, affection with her daughter, receive, along with her husband, this baby who will be born. She then begins to go to Navidad, and, quickly, the medical industry hospitals, the convince that I'm better for her is Cesare. A highly lying argument, but which is very convincing, so convincing, that produces the culture of the necessary. A culture that makes women believe that the normal birth in the private network, for example, in Rio de Janeiro, 93% are made by cesarian, against 15 to 23% in developed countries. This generates enormous benefits for children, this makes us lose this moment of love, and replaces a medical, surgeon, a woman, adopted, immobilized. It's clear that it can be humanized and it can be well made, but surely it won't have the same benefits as a normal part. Remember that, of course, there are cesaries in these areas. For each of these requests we're validating, we're criticizing the exaggeration, what is unnecessary, what is lie to me. The same way happens with a mother milk. This woman wants to breastfeed her daughter, but the maternity leave, one of the many pediatrists who can be there, working, will say, "This can be taken here, in a slum, in a slightest case, she needs hunger." She goes home safer, gets home, Grandma's grandmother, her mother, and said, "You grew up with a wood, what a business are you alive, is you strong?" The child is crying, everything is weak. In two months, this child is excited, and she loses wonders that the maternal milk can offer. This comes a big part of the industry's house. The industry is prohibited to make advertisement to the consumer, but it does advertisement for the names it gives to the forms: premium, ex-personate, surprised. The maternal milk is money, it's an amator. But he just comes with a lot of love, and he is infinitely superior to any of these forms. But the industries do the advertisement directly with the doctor, doing a doctor, convincing his national qualities and congressions, and integrally sponsoring the pediatric society, which ends unconsciously, being one of the biggest cases of the basics. And in this way, we lose the privileges of the amydation, and we try, through the first pecado, that the privation of the natural birth of the maternal leiting, serious health problems in children in mothers, and that will even reflect on the adult life that science is discovering now. In April, she grows, her mother will end up in essence, she'll have it, because she grows, because her grandmother can't take care of it, and she'll spend six, eight, ten, twelve hours in an institution. But when you get home, your parents are regretted with tired of tired tickets, in bottles, and they'll live little with your daughter. There's still work to do at home. At the end of the week, they're going to walk, and they're going to take the map, they can take the babies, because, after all, no one is iron. And what happens? If we lose what is more precious in childhood, I invite our children. We're so much regretted with the dream of adolescence. Children lose their lives with the most important people in their lives. The coexistence is what gives us intimacy, the ability to be together, the love, the feeling of taking care of someone, the feeling of knowing deeply someone, of being at home with this person. These are our precious children, and we are losing this because of the terrible peculiar thirdization of childhood. The Gabriel's parents can't cook - there's no time - there's no money to pay the employee - which is wonderfully healthy food - for a rich food, fat food food, it's so that children can be completely addicted to the administrated food, and in this unable way to eat healthy food. They can't. It's not because they're annoying. And this leads serious problems, like diabetes obesity that are exploded in childhood. And even if we want to give food, that we can give healthy food to our children, it's no longer healthy, because it comes from a database of agrotoxes and we're world champions of agrotoxes. This is the sintoxication of childhood that also brings serious problems. Gabriela will go to a chicerrima crash, which has cables, for four months, and someone knows that highly negative involvements of a child. It has an absolutely explosive energy, it needs to run to play, go out, and, however, in our urban life, it doesn't allow it to do this. People are afraid to leave children out, they stay at home, to stay at home, we have to offer permanent distraction, otherwise they can, they block me and don't forget everyone. So these children spend eight static people, eight to ten connected hours with their devices today. Once again, connecting with the game device is great, but not eight hours followed. Children don't have the right to a moment of awareness, they're permanently distracted, and this is increasingly shaking. I remember when I'd travel with cars, with my children, we'd play, it was an incredible moment. And as a child, it's something wonderful, we'd play the fingerprint. Who has played DDA? Then I chose to work, we played people's game, and at the moment of living and family, of a laughing humor, of things that are in the memory of us in childhood. We looked at the window, we saw the landscape passing, in the form of meditation, so today it's two fingers and two states for each one, other if it can't give things in the car. Even in moments, this exists, guys. (Laughter) Even in moments, where the child needs more awareness. This exists, this comes from the weapons, you can go there. Impinic, the hypothesis. (Laughter) This is the name, there it is. I still come with a layer to cover the table of successful women in a packaging look, right? Even in the moments when it needs the most awareness, that's what we offer in consciousness, abstraction, absurd and compulsive. Now, this makes us confine our children, and asking them to have a moment of consciousness, of empty, of fundamental TED, in childhood, because the empty is a berce of what is most important for us, creativity and imagination. And we're pushing this from our children with this peculiar confinement and permanent distraction. And Gabriela sets four hours of television per day. It's massacred by advertising. It's more educated by advertisers than by teachers, because at school it's spent the last four hours, and it's spent more time on television. Americans were in record because we have less time in school. Then, in the weekend, of course, she goes to the park. No, it won't go to the parking lot. The family does the classic program in Brazil for the week, which is U. Very good. Well, things are going to happen. To be more massacred by advertising, by consumption values. And this university is a coexistence. The mobility that explodes its capacity to distinguish between fantasy and reality, that explore the love of it by characters, making it fall in love with toxic products, toys, cars, and brands, inclusion of love, and that will disagree in obesity, even in the consumption of alcohol. We know that being a baby in Brazil isn't an alcoholic drink. The property is totally liberated, and always confused by friendship behind, and obviously those who need more friendships are teenagers, and they are profoundly affected by the commercials beer, and alcoholism, adolescence, is increasingly scared. This is the effect of childhood mercantilization of child consumption. Gabriela stays with the battle of commitment because her parents want my competitive princess, a very successful adult, and her agenda gets full of commitments. To relax this stress, these increasingly increase one hour, which is meditation class. (Laughter) But she could meditate in the square, people in the balance, the wonderful thing, "Who's already in the middle of the balance?" Look at the sky, look at the floor, "Look at you, there's no beautiful meditation than this one." Ronga is money with another class, and then it will be exposed to this, to the type of erotization that our society proposes, in desertion, that uses seven or eight years to sell fashion products in the evaluation of appearance and worse in the dissociation of sexuality of love and afar. This is our way of disseminating erudization, and this affects children directly, deforming their heads completely when we're eight or ten years old. This is the worst of the end of the childhood and the early erotization. Gabriela has parents who are afraid of her, because they don't live with her. So instead of limits, they put them in a trunk. It becomes the queen of the family and not the slightest of the family. It starts to decide the cardboard programs. If it goes to the school, the school's fault, we have to talk to a teacher. She earns many presents when she needed, it would be presence. And she realizes that she even more than her parents don't have authority. A child, sometimes with two or three years old, who realizes that parents don't have an authority, is very handsome, they're insecure. It needs people who lead their lives. This generates taste and generates symptoms. We know that the importance of limits and not are fundamental ways of love, that we need to give to our children, and we're losing this ability. Instead, we are doing what Americans call "raelicópteropia," etc. We interrupt each other between children's experiences and the world, making them, precisely, don't have the experience of life, and therefore, they don't develop direct mechanisms with the frustration, with pain, with the difficulty, and surely the world will deliver to them later. This is the pecado of the internalization and the super-production of the childhood. Well, before so many problems, of course, the childhood will give symptoms. The child will be rebelled, shaking, shaking, going to eat too much, staying ugly, going to the school, not paying attention, it's hyperactive, we need to do something about it. It's not possible for these children in this way. In the same way we take these poor children and put them on the chair, what's the solution we're going to give to the bad-comported children? Not the revision of all these problems, not to think. No, medicalization. We're going to give medicine, be ready for them to behave well. This is called medicalization and it's the worst of the rocks. Kin, from Mafalda, talks about this, portrays in a wonderful way. While the story of a city polluted by a factory, terribly polluted, people spending bad because of the police, they go to the doctor, see they're sick, they receive remedies, they go home, buy a remedy in the pharmacy, and what the slum that is produced exactly the medicine. And that's what we are doing for our children. Not only with the alliatic children, adults also in an overwhelming way. Medicalization of the most popular phenomena. In the United States, 15% of children today are so upset with this competitive and individualist society. The three colors are the market that grows the most depressive. We're arriving at this point. And Ritalina, the so-called medicine, which is for the tension disorder and for the activity, sold in 1999 70,000 boxes. In 2010, more than 2 million boxes. This isn't the epidemic of disease, this is a massacre against childhood. We're going back, normalizing, and asking for children to be themselves. And I'm sure that some of these geniuses, if some of these geniuses, in humanity, had this today in school, would be exactly this: rotated or non-marketized, and we would have held their genius and have lost that of wonderful creams of the ocean. So we're seeing that medicalization doesn't work, we need better solutions, to change the paths. The problems are very complex, I don't see them without fishing finds and factors that self-dravel each other. But for the whole problem, complex of humanity, as the philosopher said, there is always a simple, easy and invariably wrong solution: hate. But I want to propose a simple solution for you. I want us to reflect on this. A solution well-known TEDx. I'm sure I'm already going through my time, but it's OK, I'm a little. A solution that only goes through two factors: time and space, but nothing. In relation to time, what can we do? When we talk about cats, we're talking about penitence. Politence, today, means smooth payment, almost all the churchs. Digitalism is to give a part of what we have the most precious to our childhood, our children, which are our sacred. What do we have more precious today? Our most important capital. It's time. We have 17 hours of vigilance, it's 1.7 hours we have to dedicate to our children. 100 minutes. This gives a lot of 40 per day, it's not much, it's possible, it's just to priorize. This doesn't happen in the weekends, we start to get there in the weekends. It's possible to take the time to live our children. In relation to space, I want to propose an exercise for you. Fifteen seconds will close your eyes, I won't see you, but I ask you confidence. Close your eyes for 15 seconds, I imagine a healthy place. In a healthy city, a more healthy, a place where you wanted your children to grow because they have health, quality of life, not a good guy to live. See this place. How would he be? Please open your eyes. I'm sure most of you, yes. This shows the importance of nature. Nature is profoundly associated with health, profoundly associated with human soul. We know what makes us healthy. It's not the medical hospital, medicine, all these factors, we all know this. What we don't know, and there was an interesting experience, I started with the pattern behind, when I was delivering my presentation, and she said, "Wow, but you're talking about something incredible!" I talked about convergence and sustainability. I didn't know that everything I do good for me is being good for nature for my environment. Everything that does good health does good to the environment and vice versa. I went to bike, took my body, my city, the garbage, the pollution. The collective sport does good for the time of coexistence, reduces stress, reduces pollution. With my organic, who goes to the body, does it well for the rivers, does it come to the Earth, see the animals. Things always retreat themselves in a positive way, creating vicious cycles. And I live with nature properly said, with an open space, what does he do? Look how wonderful it is! He'll push us away from the fabrics, he'll give us awareness moments for children. It will reduce the consumption of an excessive material. He will promote the book to play, which will generate intelligence, humor, imagination, creativity. He will generate living between families, with love, he will see people living between children, different children who will know each other, and learn to deal with them, how to develop empathy, to promote the contact with the tree, and the green that produces well-being physics, mental well-being. And it's going to reduce all the problems of the company. This is a scientist, a dream I'm talking about, it's all that demonstrate that it reduces obesity, aggressiveness, happiness, exclusion, improves immunity, improves socialization and escolarity, and a marvel takes children to nature. When I talk about taking those speakers, we're not talking about spaces when boys with fat spaces, trust, and now there will be a big space. No, we're talking about anticondomínio, the apple talking about putting the wall and the city, huging the cities, and playing in the squares, occupying public spaces, buying chairs, love, affection, coexistence. There are many movements in Brazil doing exactly this. And not only in the initiative of the physical use, but also reivindicating public policies that facilitate us in contact with public space and nature. That promote circumstances, free events of these spaces, the urbanization of bathrooms, the gardens in schools, the public transport, to take these places, security. accessible and careful squares. All of this, in fact, is called the occupation of a city. The word OCOPAC used for citizen resistance today means that, occupy public space with joy, and, mainly, participate in the governance of cities. The governance of the city is what makes the difference between catástrofes, as it happened in São Paulo, where they are seeing here in a picture of Billings, a source of São Paulo, 30 or 40 years ago, and today, by the governance, and cities that have quality of life, because they have participation, they are returned to public interest, with sustainability, with equity, transparency, payment and payment. There are many movements in Brazil starting to do this, including here in Porto Alegre, and it's cool to participate in it. To conclude, the same scientists who announced a terrible, environmental crisis, which is coming from there, will see a lot of seeds, our children will take me, and also say, "In 97% of scientific consciousness, there are two ways to mitigate this crisis, reducing inequality from the social level, and we'll learn to take care of others, and we'll reduce inequality." Going to the children to nature, we're going to make them love and nature because only experimenting the ice cream, not seeing in YouTube, and we learn to love this dog and defend it in the future, because we only defend what we love. So, in summary, this is our proposal: children, already outside. Familia is already outside. Let's take care of the public spaces with the game, with games, with fun, with participation. As we're talking about utopia, I'm often showing myself a quote by Eduardo Galiano who left us this year, unfortunately. He said that utopia is in the horizon. The more I get closer, the more they get closer. If it approached 1,000 steps, it pushes itself to my steps. So, what is utopia good for? Exactly to make us walk. That she makes us walk outside. Thank you. (Applause) In 2007, I came across a large group of young adults with disabilities excluded from regular education. And since then, my biggest challenge was to look and see the effectiveness of these people so marked by their disabilities. So I created the Cafétherapeutic project, which is the group of parents, students and friends, searching for a really inclusive society, with parents, with children and partners. People with disabilities are very marked by those who can't. But I can see many things they can do. And in this project, they present this to parents, to the community and to the general society. People with disabilities, sometimes they're left aside, stop having friends because they think they're not able to have friends, to feel like acting with people. As the case of the student in Igor, for example, that in the other school he studied for four years he didn't enter the classroom because he couldn't interact with friends and teachers. People didn't make an effort for that too. So, over four years, he was in the court taking part in all the physical education classes and, as he loved running, he was running all the time. When I got to Campulimpo, I sought to know the Igor in a global way. I tried to know what he liked to do, what interests he was at school, and what we could do together so that he could achieve a better learning. The school, for Igor, was a place of despair. Well, it's not that a clean guy, today he's very happy. He has classes with several teachers, he has many friends, and he says I'm his best friend. And for two consecutive years, he gave me the present on his parents' Day. I believe that school goes far beyond the school of writing, mathematics and reading. School can teach autonomy, freedom of expression. And it can teach the student to enjoy their own learning. Schools think that they are not able to have these students and that they are not prepared to receive them. But schools need to overcome these difficulties, and that these children, inside the school, will do well for them, will need to use and believe that they are capable and for society as a whole. I learned to see the possibilities of the learning of others. Why does this choose? "I have what I know, I have what you know." And there's what we can learn together. Do you want to know what I've learned over ten years living with people with disabilities? I learned to appreciate my view, living with people, so they can see. I learned to use my hearing, to live with people who don't hear. I learned to value my legs with those who can't walk. And I learned to appreciate my ideas, with those who often have difficulties to understand what we're talking about. But the most important thing I learned was to appreciate my heart and the heart of my students, to create connections and friendships. And the most important thing for society is to learn the exercise of empathy. Thank you very much. (Applause) Good evening. I've always liked eating a lot, but I've never been to cook. When I was little, I loved to see my grandma, cook, work in the kitchen. She took account of the Christmas seeds, the new, the Páscoa. She did everything with a lot of love and affection. Who liked putting his hand in front of her, in fact, was my brother. So much so that, until today, she asks me, "How when and why did I go to the kitchen?" And this is the answer I want to give to you today. Because if there's something that can change the future of food, it's the act of cooking. In adolescence, more precisely when I was 14, I started to practice yoga. And then, Olga transformed me. It transformed my life completely. It changed my view of the world, changed my diet, and with it, I realized that food had power, let's say. And I also decided to study food philosophies that could use food as a form of prevention, cure and treatment of diseases, as a form of medicine. So I decided to study a little about "Ayurveda" and " macrobiotics." Because these philosophies rescued in me something that I think modernization took from many of us young people, which is the Cuidy and respect for nature. So I decided that we could change the way we build the food system through food. I believe that one of the side effects of modernization is the affection of man with nature, the affection of urban life and rural life. I don't believe that if we bring a little bit of rural life to the city, we can strengthen the bonds between man and nature. For example, planting urban gardens. It's a way that we can connect with nature. And years later, since I was 18, I went to live outside, and there I learned to cook. But also to improve the quality of life in health terms, I fell in love with the culinary, I fell in love with the kitchen, and I understood that we could use food as a tool, not only to improve the quality of food, the process of production and consumption of food. So I'll give you an example of the production process of meat. There are two principles that lead the production of meat in industrial scale: it's quantity and speed. The more it is produced, the more cheap it is produced, the worse it is quality, and the higher it is cost for the environment and for our health. In terms of speed, the cycle of the animal is accelerated artificially, the animal cycle is accelerated artificially, and he loses his quality of life, his health and his time of life. I believe we can and should change this food system. I was the other day passing on the supermarket and I realized that the kilo of the fungus was cheaper than the tomato kilo. I said, "Guys, how can it be?" This is very complex. How can it cost so little to create an animal from birth to abat? This didn't enter my head. In terms of vegetables and vegetables, the process of production in industrial scale is also very harmful for our lives, for our health, and for the environment, because, today, Brazil is the biggest consumer of agrotóxes in the world. Each Brazilian consumes, on average, 5 kg of agrotóxic per year. It's an exorbitant amount. I believe people know the benefits of agrotoxes, but even so they keep tolerating this abuse in the use and consumption. And I wanted to understand why. But the answer is because our current society has inverted values. There's an investment of values. Why does a person worry about not buying a false perfume because they think there will be any alergic reaction, because they don't know the procedure, they don't know what kind of chemistry is there, and don't worry about eating an intoxicated vegetal? Why is that? I wanted to understand and discover that this is the change of values. And we need to teach people to appreciate the organic products, because when you buy a well-being of the producer, which is something that people don't know that, behind that alphace, there was someone who cared with all the love and took this leap to you. So we pay for the well-being of the producer, we invest in health, and we respect nature. That's why I think I fell in love with the culinary and nutrition. In terms of distribution, it's also not efficient. I think you must know that we produce a lot of food. A third of the food we produce is simply dispersed, thrown away. And we ask ourselves why there are people still passion for hunger. And the reason is a map of distribution. We have to review this. In terms of consumption consumption, the way we consume in today's food is scary. My grandmother is a paulist. She marked São Paulo. If I grab it, put it in the middle of Paulista Avenue, I'm sure it's very scared, seeing those exceptions walking on the street, talking about the cell phone, swimming from a pizza piece, for example. Because getting hurt is something people, many people think it's time loss, but, in fact, it's very important. So, she would have almost a synthesis, but because she doesn't recognize that as a way of reflection, like a synutric form of feeding itself. These feces, these quick foods, were made of the same country, to be able to eat together with another activity, or talking about the cell phone, the watching TV. This makes us lose the notion of society. We end up opening space to the classroom, which is very harmful, very harmful for our health. So we need to reveal the way we consume food. And these little biscuits and so on, there are also many chemical adjectives, and a level exaggerated from Salgo Huriaçúcar, which are the three turbicious, right? And, mainly, the savor remains destroying our paladar, they degenerate our nervous system, and they end up creating a dependence not only on physics, but also a mental dependence, a physiological dependence. In other words, industrialized products in excess are very harmful. I don't even call them food. For me, they're food measures because you can even consume, if you know how to do it, but it won't nourish you, it won't feed you. And who here still makes panels pipoca? What a pack of panels in the microwaves place? Look! Metade, half. (Laughter) Who here still makes a cake instead of buying that brief cake? Yeah! Also, half a half. (Laughter) This question may seem an inoffensive question, I don't want to say anything, but, in fact, it means a lot. You can change the panel pipoca for the microwaves' pipoca, you're already causing a dam to your health, because you're consuming chemicals that you're not putting with the package of microwaves. It's a packaging that could be less trash in the world. So, I think that the excessive consumption of industrialized products is very prejudicial. To sum up this question of food production process, I think that this dynamic of feeding this food system is not healthy. It's not working. And we must change. But how can we change? The main answer is to go back to the fuel. To cook is synonym of art, culture, leisure, health. To cook brings independence, bring self-knowledge, bring autonomy, safety, freedom. To cook is the fundamental art of life. If we don't cook, someone will cook for us. I hope it's not an industry. Because they don't cook, they simply illustrate food processes. If you leave the industry feeding you, it will choose what you'll have to dinner: Lazanha, frozen, hamburg, street dog. How about a pizza? And I said, "Dale, script." Because not even Pizza, we know how to do more. So I believe we're... "No." That's it. Where is the rice and the feijão? Where is our belly rice in every day, that keeps our belly and our soul? I think there are many people who don't have interest, who don't have a price for the kitchen, must think that making food is very workable, very anti-pratic, is waste of time. But, for example, if you let a sheet of paper at night a day, at morning, and, in 20 minutes, you have a ready beach in the pressure panel. I'll simply take a day to make the Feijão stop frozen for the rest of the week. Together with the fresh street, who makes you 20 or 30 minutes, the legumes you've already cut and washed in the refrigerator when the fair arrived, and, half an hour, you have the ready reflection. This would be perhaps at the same time that you would take to wait Pizza to get, to wait for Pizza's book. So, I believe we must change the way we see the kitchen, how we see the act of cooking. Everyone can and must cook. Men, woman, boy, girl, child, adult, and elderly. There's no age, no sex, no gender. Everyone can cook. Everybody must cook. By changing education, we teach children to take the fair children to choose the vegetables that will have for dinner, putting the children to practice a better battle. These children will grow with a holistic view of the world. They'll know where food comes from, which many people think comes from the supermarket shelter. Children will grow regardless of the food industry because they will know how to cook. They will grow dependent on the pharmaceutical industry because they will be much less sick, growing with less food, a healthy food. I believe we have to change the food dynamic. We have to change our appreciation with food. We have to value the food more, value the act of eating and cooking. Education isn't just talking, please, thank you for permission. Education doesn't mean understanding that the hospital is synonymous of health. I think there's a healthy quality of life, a healthy lifestyle for us to have less hospitals, this is education. Education and prevention. So, the future of food will decide the future of humanity. To cook and choose good foods are choices we can do to change the world better. Thank you. (Applause) LP: Life is not the one we live, but it's the one we remember and reminds us of telling. To be here in the background, to talk about the transforming power of stories, is to pass through my own story, because most of my mother's family are here. I came here when I was a child, I spent vacation with my cousins, my brothers, and also to family parties. My grandmother, Mario Güeyce, was the first tribe planter of the Brazilian mechanized work here in the earths of Butiá. And then, he got married with my grandmother Tília and had seven children, among them my mother, who got married with my father, and after having had my five siblings, I got to this world. Personally, it was yesterday, but 50 years ago. These are the stories we tell that make us be who we are. On the other hand, we transform ourselves. Those who listen, also transform themselves. We want to transform ourselves, we want to change, but we are our story. Before looking at this future, we need to see who came back and honor all stories. My passion for stories started very early. I've always liked writing, reading, telling. In high school, I even wrote a book called "Descaminhos," that talked about my father's death, or how I remembered how this had happened. This book helped me live the mourning, and I know he helped many people too. So having told this story to me brings one of the most beautiful things about this, which is the power that people can feel welcomed in the other's history, they feel in the colore of each one's stories. So, it's always very important that we talk about what happened to us because, obviously, someone will live and sit in the school of this story and feel welcomed. But one day, I met this whole world here, from TEDx, I met incredible people around the world. And then, I, who worked with advertising, who wrote stories, reports, 15, 30 seconds, about products, understood the 45 years I needed to change, that I needed to expand. And I started to help people tell their stories. Because the world of advertising had already been very small for me. So I started doing this. And one of the stories I want to share with you is Tiago. In Chiago, I invited him to talk two years ago in TEDx about entrepreneurship with purpose, something so fashionable nowadays. But he brought me another challenge, which was to talk about bubble, because that was what he always suffered and he wanted to share the story with others. And I left because I had to do with the subject. But Tiago, while we prepared to talk about him, always came with a lot of water, and always a lot of complaints, a right, about everything they had done with him. But what's the goal to tell a story, to keep complaining who did that with us? And otherwise, to inspire people that they can embrace themselves, that they can assume who they are, as we already said here, without fear. And he, who understood this, was changing the tone. And, on the day, Tiago grew up in the stage. And he transformed himself to tell his story and to talk for the first time he was gay openly. And he talked to a lot of property about bullying, acceptance and family. And it was beautiful. I like to tell this a lot, because not only he had this transformation with him, the people I know who know him, also to have seen that the rod they imagined that Tiago had, was nothing more than a great flavor. And they started to understand him better and he welcomed himself. Just like he welcomed himself, I'll tell his story, many people welcome themselves in his story. The week went by, he sent me a audio saying that many boys have sought him, even more at a time that is so expensive for dialog and acceptance, to tell him that he had felt welcomed in his story. They wanted to share with them the problems that were going through their families. Now, imagine if Tiago hadn't told his story, and he hadn't assumed this for people in a way that there was no shame. So, telling stories for me causes micro-revolutions in our lives. These are many. They're just in their own, but also in mine. From everyone who goes through a TEDx, when we get ready to hear, we change ourselves. And for me, I don't have a rule about how to tell stories, although I work with this at seven years old, training many people to be here in this place. But if there's no rule, we have the tip of how to start, about how to ask a question to the audience, tell something funny, show the picture of their children. But, in fact, I think this is not the most important. And for me, if there's no formula, there's a great rule, it has to come from the heart. And to talk about heart, you have to have a lot of courage. And it's not the roof that courage has the heart color. That's why I told the story of the "weve." "Wow, the teacher is the University of Jerus beyond." He researches listening. We stayed for months preparing his talk in the TEDx Lossador. And there was always something that bothered him and me. And one day, two weeks before his talk, I called him in the Skype and said, "I discovered what's wrong with this." Every time you talk to me, you tell me, "It's all here, everything is here, and it shows me your head, when, in fact, you have to leave everything here, you have to be a heart." And he changed everything. And one day, he gave a incredible talk about listening, about the importance of listening to others. How was the fact that he had been heard when he needed the most, when he was a kid, when he had cancer, who made him study about it? And he taught me that we're always worried about wanting to learn how to talk, how to count. There are so many addictions of oratory and writing, but who's worried about learning how to listen? Because he tells me, and we saw this today, that when we listen to truth, we change ourselves. And we are afraid to transform ourselves. We're afraid to change, although the word we say here is that we're going to change. So we talk about change, but there's always this fear. And as we always get there and say, "I'm not going to listen. For us and for others. And listening also comes before that famous word: empathy. We talk so much about empathy, but we don't have one minute to look at the other, to come and embrace and say something. We don't have time for people, because we're worried about our lives. We always have a priority. So, how can we talk about empathy if we haven't yet learned to listen? This, after listening to his talk, made another TEDx. And empathy has another story, and I could tell you so many, because I'll tell you that in these seven years there were more than 400 people, more than 400 most varied stories I've heard, all the others. I also learned that empathy, when it taught me that we need to look at the problem of street residents, for example. When we say on the street, many of us, that we don't have anything to give, when they ask us something, we have it. We have at least one smile, and he doesn't like anything to give. So, again, it's the stories we hear, and that we tell, that make us be who we are. And by listening to others, we truly transform ourselves. And if the other listens, and counts, he also becomes. And in the middle of the pregnancy, a fight, which was this process here for me, was out of my trip, (Laughter) I suffered a lot to be here today and teach something to do the other, many people asked me, "Ana, after all, why do you like to do this so much?" Why are you doing this now and helping people? And the answer, for me, and for everyone, came from a poem that I even wrote, and that now you apologize me, but I'll read it. I wanted to free many of the people I know. To give her the key to your lives. From the fourth of the flaws. The classrooms, the values. It was the kitchen of uncertainty. I wanted to free many people I know. I gave them the faith in life. Faith in some humans. I wanted to free many people I know. To be that they have the right to change. The right to cry. The right to not love 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. I'd like to free many people I know. Freedom of your story, which, although important, is not determining. Liberating fear. I wanted many people I know had at least one minute of distance, then they could look at the side and come back to smile, tell and hear. And you? Stories will tell you about your life. Stories, do you want you to count on you? Thank you. (Applause) The truth is that on Earth, for me, that I don't belong to many spaces, it's because, in fact, I'm part of the true step, where there are all kinds of stars. And the stars don't pull roles or classifications. They are only belonging to their plural spaces. There's no sunny, thin, ugly, rich or poor. These are the legacy of existence. This is one of the poems I wrote for a while during a very obscure phase that rejected on my life, a phase in which the right of just being was denied. However, resisting and existing was always my life condition for me, since the moment I recognized myself as a trans woman, a woman who transcended the gender that was attributed to her, at the moment she was born. I don't look for acceptance, but respect, and the right for life. And precisely because of that, I created this poem, because he does a perfect analogy between us here on Earth and the stars in the sky. The universe is infinite and, together with them, there are millions and millions of stars, but no one is less important than the other, no one was covered or the beauty of the other. So, why is it that we, here below, so small, can't produce something so simple: acceptance, empathy, and understand definitely what is different to Greek? It would be a very bad experience, if we had a society where we were all equal. So that's why we have privilege and the opportunity to be different. Different is beautiful. It's incredible when we feel with someone different from us, we learn new stories, new narratives. And this is rich, this exchange. So I'd like to ask you a request: I want you to allow yourself today to know something or someone different from you. They allow themselves. Well, guys, in this process of self-acceptance, before trying to understand others, it's important that we understand who we are first. After starting my gender transition, I always questioned myself about who I was or what I would be. And in this process, the bathroom, for me, was a capture ball. It was where I could be the same. It was where I laughed, where I cried, where I admired my body, where I questioned God, why I was different. Well, the bathroom turned into the best friend. He was always there, after a replete of bullying, or when I wanted to put his place in his head and dance rebel, because I only rewarded until today. (Laughter) But the question is: What was in the bathroom that didn't have any other places and that was denied to me? Or better, why do I need to be a bathroom to have this freedom? And the answer is simple: the fact that I'm different. From that moment on, I started to understand that the difference in this society is something bad. And why? For the lack of information. And when it's about the trans universe, this path is even harder. I researched on the Internet, but I didn't see people like me. I didn't even know what trans people were. And, during my 21 years, more or less, I started to see my friends transitioning, and that desire to grow inside me. Before, I want to become trans, too, like this. Everyone becoming, therefore, she thought and started the wrong way, which is to mirror me in the other. So, during my artsenic graduation, I had the opportunity to know myself in front of me. Theater showed me a new world, he was a divisor of water in my life. It was in theater that I learned to deal with the difference. It was theater I learned to understand the other. So I started looking for my true teenage years, and I started to unleash. It's as if you enter a couple, spend a while there, this is a beautiful bubble. However, this process has painful phases and that not everyone is prepared to deal. It's hard when you're in the midst of some changes, and you still have to learn to deal with the non-acceptance of others. There's a lot of empathy in this world. And if you are a black, fat woman, this path is harder. We went through many daily tests. In the case of us, for example. People think I'm a phase. They bother themselves with their transformation. Your process of transformation affects people, something that shouldn't happen. So they ask, "But come here, are you really behind?" Our new things, there's no traffic face. No, this is easy, it's going to happen. Folks, who are consciousness, chooses and expectancy of 35 years? Is there any crazy person here who wants to see your institution? While men have their life expectancy of 76 years. Who are aware, chooses to live in the country that kills trans people all over the world? I wouldn't choose that. So, they question this, and they question about the city of this. For example, Antra, the National Association of transvestite Women, said that we, transsexual women in Brazil, have up to 14 times chances of dying of being murdered more than a man, killed. And second, if we compare with the United States, for example, in 144 people who were killed here in Brazil, 2016, facing 21 deaths in the United States, we, Brazilians, have up to 9 times more chances of dying with the risk of belief and violence. Being trans in an option, but in a life condition. There is no magic formula. There's a wheelchair and a strength, resistance, expectation of 35 years. That doesn't exist. Who likes it to be like this? We could measure this panel better. But it's not. I could stay here in the whole afternoon, explaining to you how I brought my life story, but in each one of us, it's the protagonist of your own story. To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world, and it only depends on ourselves. For example, I'm the proof of this. After I finally found who I was, after I finally discovered my essence, I started to use my art as a form of deconstruction of ideas to establish about me. I wanted to play in YouTube, where gradually I became a reference to other people, not only trans people. I've been talking about a life experience for many people, I've been living a model, a magazine, "J" and "perform" and Youtube, and in an absurd episode I exhibited this novel for more than 1 million people in 130 countries. (Cheers) (Applause) It's a very big responsibility to be able to talk about the difference for so many people, to represent a flag and be proud of everything I represent with it. But that's how I did it. To be abused, I went from my own name. I said, and many people had to swallow. And even though in all subjects that came out of me on the Internet and talked about it, they were comments like "Macher, shown," "You'll never be a woman, die." (Applause) What doesn't have a price is to receive messages of other trans girls, thank me, to teach them more than their own daughter. The best one is to receive a message of other transsexuals with brilliant eyes, thank me for seeing me there and seeing myself there. This has no price. To understand the difference is something that can definitely change the world. But I also understand that I don't want to be just an actress. I'm a small part of what I am. I'm far beyond that. I'm far beyond it. But to understand this, I have a place of knowledge, I really need to understand that we are many. I'm plural beings. The difference is Greek. The sky is the refugee of the salty beings. Who was me, a being next? A blue immensity, freedom without limits. I and the sky, the yours and me. In one of the looks. Don't ask me to stop. I've already freed myself from my corridors. On the past, only those who remain their scars, who mark my soul. But the future. What does the future promise? That's what I want. A side, now I'm, now I'm going to fly. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Cheers) I'm a publicity, I've always worked with communication, information technology. Together, I did work with children and hospitals, children with cancer. I spent many years doing this and accompanying children. And even with all my knowledge, about communication, many times I couldn't explain to children what cancer was, what was in treatment, protocols, procedures. And they knew that I had a ovarium system that doctors called "thera toma." One beautiful day, one of them said, "Wow, we open our heads, we open the belly to take the tumors, it won't take a sixth." Well, it had been invited, right? But I saw that in the hospital I could operate. I was already used for doctors, nurses. And I decided to do surgery there. I took courage. I had never been internal, given the point, nothing. And it was with a two-hour surgery of a simple procedure. I woke up ten hours later and I noted. At the same time, I stayed with children with cancer. I looked down, full of tubes and connections, the belly was all mixed. I called the nurse and asked, "Are you cancer?" She said, "Yes." So I asked her to call my parents, and she said, "It's outside the visite time." And I asked her to handle me, until I slept. I cut it off only after the room. With cancer, metástasis and committed gangs. I'd say to children, "Don't give Google," because, after all, it wasn't the best place, nor when you're lucky. So I went to look for information in a safe place. And I started looking for hospitals websites. And the only thing that was the safe information at that moment is that I would die, because it was the most aggressive tumor and with little cure chances. And then, in that time, I realized so much information that sometimes didn't help, that I didn't engage. And how can you engage someone if many times you can't even say "cancer"? I was a doll, and I opened what bothered, scholarshiped, landed. But my friends were giving hair to help me. From then on, I realized this information of society to reduce hair. In fact, the surgery wasn't for me, the surgery for them, that I wasn't able to see myself a doll. And with that, I saw several other information that I thought weren't the most adequate. When I entered the hospital, the kids said, "Wow! I said, "No, now I'm equal to you." I got cancer. I have one of you. Wow! Calma, we don't get it, OK? I said, "I can stay close to me." Don't get it. But the games were overwhelmed and the children started talking about various things and counting about procedures. When I started putting the catéter, because I did chemotherapy before, the first "fisport Veia," I received a hospital kit. The kit came with a sabonete, a toothpaste and a teeth curve, but also a shampoo, a touch and a pente. And I didn't have hair. And this is information for me. And I started photographing procedures, photographing all the things I did. And I'd send children to try to explain, "Look, you'll go through this, you'll go through it." And what happened? Children started to give me their procedures. So they showed me, sent videos, working, taking chemotherapy, going through radio. Several procedures until I didn't do it, they taught me. And we've been playing, but we think that the child doesn't understand, right? I think the child doesn't know. You don't know the protocol, the name of chemotherapy, the procedures, all this. All your parents try not to talk to protect them, but then you think, "Oh, but chemotherapy is a strong medicine, that's why hair falls." Then the child goes with the mother in the pharmacy, and the pharmacy tells you a strong medicine, what will she find? That's it, it's hair. But then, when we explained that chemotherapy caused the fall of hair because it killed cells that quickly doubled, but not only the cells of the tumor and clicked quickly, as the hair cells also understood, they still said, "Oh! It's working and the children started to engage. And we started to talk a lot about procedures. It's a day when doctors started to tell me, "If there's a patient who's going to put catheter, you can come here, I'll go there." There's a patient who's going to push a leg, you can come here, and I'd say, "Doctor, I don't have five organs, but I have two legs." "Ah, but the teacher comes running, and then I go." Until the day I couldn't work anymore, not with advertising. I called the doctors, health professionals, and our creative friends, and we decided to open a NGO, and we opened BABA. It's called BABA because it's the baby's baby. What did we do? Usually, those who make health information are health and publicity professionals, but you say that information is focused on the patient. But the patient approached the end. This patient's entrance is in the middle, but at the end of the process. We decided to put the patient in the middle of the process. So we put children to work. We spent a long time reading what we thought could improve, what we had doubt, what we couldn't understand that doctors said. And with this, we illustrated the most common terms of the oncological environment. And we illustrated all this with the support of health professionals, but with something very important: sometimes, as something seems, it doesn't need to be explained. When you like someone and you wrote "I love you with the heart," do you draw the ventricles? That's not it. That's how it started to do. And these children started to understand more about processes. From these terms, our first material came out, which was a guide. This guide is to distribute to children in treatment. Unfortunately, we can only do it in 2 to 3,000 guides per year. If we go to a sponsor in the audience, (Laughter) we have, for 13,000 diagnosed children with cancer in Brazil. What happened? The hospitals started to use it, to start asking, and we're in more than 40 hospitals in Brazil. The kids from outside started to see and started to ask. A new Zelândia, Japan, of several places. I'd say, "But she's in Portuguese," she'd say, "But we have translator, and the guide is very asked in the northern northern northern, because children and parents are often illiterate. So the doctors ask and risk the pages of the procedures children will do. With this, we started to dismistify and engage the patient, to do many other actions. The information, guys, is very important. The information, sometimes, isn't just that thing, information technology, it's not just that complex, 3D, robotics. This information is a pent in a kit. So, what do we say and do we prepare? That you need information in everything. For example, I don't know if you know, but when you make events, Carexas children earn much more present and pay attention to what hair is. Sometimes that doll has already made the treatment, it's without cancer. Sometimes the child falls, with cancer, because there's no chemotherapy. Don't take care of clowns or don't have something at the moment. And sometimes not only for children, for society in general. When I was in treatment, if there's something in society, unfortunately I'm an advertising, and we know if you put a careful child, sad, you'll sell much more, you'll raise much more money. I don't get out of Biaba, that doesn't have it. And what happens with this? And when are you the patient? How many times I was at the hospital in the room, fragile, debilitated, I received these materials and thought, "Will I get to this internship?" Suddenly, I received the obligation of parents and mothers with healthy children who call me and say, "My daughter is giving a lot of problem at home." I want to take it to the hospital to see what difficulty is. Very well, the mother wanted to do this, but you've already thought that, inside this room, there's a child with an adult who, in the case, was me, that people looked at me to pass to the window, to see the father with a good life, and in that time we needed self-esteem, you only have information that put you down. So I think it's very important to give a little attention to this too, not only to patients and to society. We make information with all these people who help, but also with much love, because we think it's very important. I entered the hospital to help some children, they saved my life, and today everything I can do is information to save many others. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. In my psychiatrist and neuroscientist career, every time I meet a patient with chemical dependency, I hear a phrase that is the following: "Doctor, when I want, I stop." Just don't stop what I don't want. Fortunately, it's not easy because dependency here is a disease and a disease of the brain. And a disease that complicates a lot the lives of people. But what if, in fact, the answer is inside us to treat the dependence here? What if, in fact, these patients were right? It's in the search of this that we thought of many things. One of these things is in our own organism. This organism has its own defense mechanisms that can protect itself from great threats. One of these defenses is in our brain. It's called "factory barrier." The mattressphalic barrier, despite appearing a complicated name, is a set of cells that are in our arteries and veins of the brain, and that make virus and not enter the brain, and don't do bad for our heads. Unfortunately, drugs can contain this barrier. They are very small molecules, and for being very small, they have almost balanced passage for the refactive barrier. That's why they end up being able to enter and act in our brain, in the circus of recompense in other circuits. We also have another very important protection system, which is our immune system. Our immune system is composed by cells, anticorpos and various chemical strategies that act to protect us in an implacable way against bacteria, viruses and toxic substances too. In this video, you can see the microphone in the blood stream, running behind a bacterium, until it can engage it, erase it and neutralize it. Well, then, could we not join these two things to try to help our patients? Two defense mechanisms that are innate, that are ours. A few years ago, we started discussing these questions. Until the day that some researchers in the United States, studying people who end up using large number of drugs, realized that these people who used more drugs produced anticops against their own drugs. It's almost as if their immune system disseminates this way, "Stop!" It's enough. We don't need drugs anymore in the system. It's overcarded. From this point on, we started to think how we could use the immune system and the palefalic barrier to help these patients. My team, already a few years ago, is researching, and, in the last two years, we managed to get to a molecule, in fact, two, which is able to send this message to our immune system. A message of hope, that is, the immune system produces anticorpos against drugs and we'll try to help this person to earn new freedom and control it. How does it work? The substance enters in our body, which consumes drugs, this small molecule connects itself to a large molecule and produces glasses, and anti-coffs are large molecules. That's it. It's no longer happening in the armed barrier you fail. Look at this image here, how is this beautiful process? On the right of you, we have a while that didn't receive the vaccine. These white dots you're seeing are a doll molecule in the mark with radiation. When these rats are not immunized, they receive this cocaine marked by radiation, they freely pass and accumulate in the brain of these animals. Once we managed to immunize them, and then you can see, on the left side of you, there's a pretty significant decrease of white dots in the animal brain, which means that, probably, this cocaine that passed, stopped passing. Besides that, we asked ourselves, "Where did she stop, since she didn't happen?" And it's very interesting that vaccinated rats have a concentration of radiation radiation radiation, much bigger in blood than the rats that weren't vaccinated, indicating that, besides crazy, drugs were arrested in a blood fabric. Another very interesting thing is that when we evaluate the behavior of these rats, which is to receive a vaccine, they have a behavior as if they didn't realize they had received drugs. They are standing inside the box or more inhibited than they don't happen with the rats that receive cocaine. What our group is working now is, in fact, to bring this solution to the market and to help people to make freedom. We believe that this therapeutic treatment or vaccine, anti-drogas, can be a treatment that will open a window of opportunity for these people with chemical dependency. Those who know, in a while with the vaccine, they will be able to have time, a time to decide. A time to gain freedom again and discuss with themselves if they want to use or not use drugs. Thank you very much. (Applause) I'm being a psychotherapist for more than 40 years. I want to say that, besides neuroscience, besides psychosis, there's a terrible disease. It's a harmful disease, that James Villenu, Pierre Vai, and I, in fact, call it "normality," "patology of "normality." And I must say that the great encounter of this TEDx is that the nurse is being punctuated from the beginning. What's the norm? They are habits, attitudes, data of social consensus, a set of pathogenic and pathological behaviors, in some way, in some meditation. The war is cool, for example. An example, maybe the most deadest than the northern. Until where I can understand, there are two fundamental foundations of the norm. And it's the systemic situation. The other is the evolution. Systemic, the situation of respect to the fact that the norm hasn't always existed, it hasn't always existed. The normose is a typical disease, we live inside a context, the violence of moments where predominates the lack of listening, the lack of responsibility, in its word, egocentrism. So, is it normal? This is to adapt to a sick and mantee system. I've been a worker for more than 31 years from the International University of Paz, UNPAS. And people think that peace is in good, that peace is the absence of conflicts. "No." Basic is good fight. The opposite of peace, as the movie, the Chinese wisdom, is this ignorance. How many wars, Perei, who came, a little of words. Acimilitating by peace. But with other weapons. The weapons of consciousness, of responsibility, of compassive love. So, in the same way, health is not the absence of symptoms. Sometimes the healthy person has the ability to present symptoms. Without more concepts. Sometimes even a conscious, lucid, an indignation, fair. This reminds me of a family word. When my daughter was five, and today she's 34, Isabela, and there's a eight-year-old boy, the mother asked him, "What's the princess you like the most?" Is the cigarette, Cinderella, the beautiful adolescence? She thought and answered, "I like all Mayan writes." I'm fine. I too. I respect many people who say more. Sometimes, I love contradictions because there's accessibility to feel in their own skin that the "normatics" aren't. People who looked for me with the disease of panic, for example, were all sensitive people to not say sensitive, that captured had open doors to perception. A fear that isn't just your fear? Is it the fear of the family system? It's the method of humanity in a group of risk of extinction. It's the fear of animals being disimated, of forests being desertified. In these people say, "Dad! I don't respect many people denominated by psychotics and neurotics. Not everyone has competence to enlighten. That's why, in Africa, people who are considered crazy are also considered healthy. Because they are like a paradise that captures the cultural, systemic contradictions. And sometimes they don't fail. As I said, the difference between a Santo and a mad person is that the Santo doesn't know, it doesn't speak. Maybe these people, at least in a large measure, that we call psychiatric, are healthy, failed. I respect neurotypes, at least it has a decent of having a pain of consensus, a dream. The problem is in armodes, it's the people who don't care. It's a dehumanity. So, I think of a occasion that I came from a seminary here, or knowing that I was the Porto Alegre, a psychotherapist told me, "Doctor, I have a problem in my house. My son is good. It's kind. He gets up to a older person sitting down. He doesn't reach. He's good. It's target of bullying. People get ridiculated, "My son, what do I do with my son?" Is it good? Do you understand that I'm wanting to say, "I'm in lunch?" So, I must say that all the people I respect and admire are all unpleasant. Fortunately. Like this fabulous team that organized this encounter. (Applause) And nothing against correctness. At that moment, you have to suffer from a desert. So, you've talked about the norm, the machismo, the racism, the homophobia, of these exclusions. "Marmosi." Could we say, "No, it's environmental?" The nurse of ultra-specialization, which is a person who knows almost everything, almost nothing. (Laughter) This auditorium takes fire, and each one is looking at the minimum, he doesn't realize, his existence doesn't make sense. We're in an inexorable globalization, a person who is really specialist is incompetent. But it's not about doing the police of the generalist, but it's not the functions of computers. Maybe there's a concept in this education that has also been pointing as a possibility of solution that I've called vocation. And the deepest voice of the desire that brought us incarnation. It's what brings us in a stage like this. It's what we're wrong with a promise that we're saying. We've only seen Pik Nik. We came to tell you a story. Just you can happen. If you didn't count, she would get lost. So, the foundation of the norm is the situation. There's another, very important. I'm evolving. It hasn't been said today. It's the question we need to do. What differentiates the human species of other species? What differentiates us from a snake, a monkey? I think of a friend, "Wow, an alternative Nobel Prize, the economy of country in development, Max, Life, Chilean." When I met my partner, he told us that since he was a boy, he wanted to know that the human being was disturbed from other species. Is it intelligence? "No!" Is it language? "No." It's culture. "No." Is it humor? "No." And one day, talking to his father, that very respected guy, and his father says, "It won't be stupid, my end." (Laughter) He assisted a little light, and he said he became the first stupidist. (Laughter) stupidology is a science that we need to study. It differentiates itself, for example, of imbecility, which is absolutely indigenous. I like to remember the slower, the creator of God, a big brother, and he used to tell us that it's necessary to be a great animal idiot of the lands for the brain cortex. The question is stupid, because it reversed with rationality. With graphs, tablets, sophisticated diplomas and universities, as a person who is sitting in the garbage of a tree, closing. Ninest also said that for him, there were only two infinite things in this human stupidity. And he grew up: "Ahimist, with relation to the universe, I still have my doubts." (Laughter) But I need to say that I discourse from Einstein and Machsnephing, and considering that they are pointing not to the characteristic of the species, yes, of the north Mozen. Human beings are not from their nature, stupidity, on the contrary. We were born to be, to cry, to serve. So, I prefer to think of a confuse, which, in 2600 years, said that what differentiates our species of other species is unnecessary, it's incomplete. We are not born humans. We do ourselves humans. A tartaruga is born, covered a place, have you ever seen it? And go to the sea!" We don't. Are we inacabados? That's why saying confuse, human beings need education. Have you heard of school to tartarugas? Or for help? It's education, it's the perfection, we're the teachers. And it's not just about cultivating the brain, which, since the 17th century, seems that it's just developing a rational testing. Isn't it? It's about cultivating the dimensions of the soul of the psychiatrist. They developed emotional intelligence, relationship intelligence, the unionic intelligence of dreams. Learn to read the book at night. But it's also necessary to develop a consensional alphabetization. To develop consciousness of where to play the values of a ethics with heart. He summarized this way, his own confusion, oriented my heart to learn, to the next few years, his long existence. At 30 I put my feet firmly on the floor. The 40s no longer suffer from "perplexity." At 50s, I knew which were the fears of the sky. When I was obsessed, I listened to my elderly. At 70s, I could follow the indications of my own heart because what I wanted no longer that day, the borders of justice. Even if the terapeutas and Alexandria told us, in 2000 years, "You exchange clothes and five million." It leads to be a whole existence to change the course. This is the task. In this sense, the norm refers to an evolutionary stagnation. They are people who don't invest in the most properly human potential. That's why I like to trust that the biggest discovery of the 21st century will be human beings. Now, the opposite case, is the question: Is there 21st century for the human being? Not less than that, it finds this game, the future of new generations. So, the norm is terrible, because it's not insidious in the silences, people don't realize it. It's not easy for you to become a human being. David didn't understand the human evolution, he was a naturalist. He understood from the natural evolution in the human being, but the human being, where the nature itself can learn to know each other, to know, to smile, to smell. Someone asked for IP, talk about God. And IP flowed. Maybe there's a way of talking about a monastery in the big life: it's fluorescent, with human beings that, potentially, we are. So, I still want to talk about a story we hear, "Don't go." For more than 30 years, the little guy learned to know this story. It was once an incendiar forest. And all the bugs run away, all of them. Less, let's say, that it took a source, a water drop, and played in the middle of the fire. And I'd go back, resiliently, another drop, located in the middle of the fire. And I returned with patience, the wings, the little ones, played in the middle of the fire. In tattoo, João, seeing that, said more, "Hey, Floo, do you think that with these little rhythms you'll erase this infernal fire?" And I say, "I know it's not, Tatu's friend." Now, I'm doing my part. We're all very tired of revolutionary. People who want to change the world of society, sometimes with good intentions, but always in a arrogant way, because there are hundreds to transform themselves. It's not our task to change the other, nor the world. Each one of us is a public square pedacy, and the first responsibility is to introduce a little peace, a little bit of order, a little love in this pedacy of the world that the big world confies each one of us. And if we don't do this, where could we be transforming facilitators? For these revolutions and failed, and they keep failing. I like to talk about conspiration, which is to breathe consciously, I can, with others, with the world and with mystery. I recommend a book: "The Korean conspiration of Marilyn Fex," which studied a lot about these spontaneous, institutional movements from a giant narrative. Beija-flor has no ideology. He doesn't have flags. He's not cutting anyone. "I'm not pushing anyone." It's part of it. This is what we can do. We can stand up. What could our part do? In fact, since tomorrow, I'm seeing beija-flores who see each one talking about their water. And all of you who are necessary, at some point, will be here, in what you're in this stage, but in the stage, your water drop, because we can always make a candle, instead of just complaining about the darkness. So I want to conclude saying that it's time to rethink. It's time to not think. Meditation. Because when our mind was exhausted, our transbord rate. It's time for renewation. I love poets. I believe that love with peace and poetry will still save the world. I want to conclude with the poem of the sixth window: Renovate. It's born intimate. Multiply your eyes to see more. You apply your arms to scenarios everything. Distributes that have seen you. I created others for other visions. Strange arms that have this meat so that they forget the cold. Being always the same. Always the other. But always: self. It's always far. And inside everything. Thank you very much. (Applause) Between a good school. It decorates. I took good grades. choose the profession that will define you for the rest of your life, while you're still a child. I've always wanted to be a lawyer, a publicity, or a market, since my mother has angry. I chose a collection of renown, of public preference. Four or five years ago, using the law of the least effort. Remember a channel. Imagine a multinational company not recognized by their family. Be calm. I work twelve hours a day, exhausted until the limit of their forces. To be obvious, your cancer needs to be chronic. Let's make intermediate meetings. "Diocosque" didn't take anywhere. It shows you that you are important for structure. More than working is important, the relatives are always producing. Listen to the shirt. Carre a six flexible point. There's someone in love, inherited, wedding. He's a mini opponent. Spread the corporate pyramid. There's a shirt. Lambotas. A job exchange. Being a manager. The car of the firm. Keep offraid and copy them. Happiness at the time. Mrs. Cortados and sapatenes. Dix, shirt. Luke is the first apartment. There's a child. After two years, your second child. Is it yours? (Laughter) Strange the car, year, no. It buys an apartment and suffers 180 payments. That first case is to be judged with an interesting person in marketing. (Laughter) Disney? Two years later, I spent seven days in Europe, Miami. Europe. Money. More meetings that don't take anywhere. completely disqualified people being promoted before you. The projects that start and dismorate as their desires. A continuous feeling of change. The void that countries in the mall in the weekends can't apply anymore. The discharge is a pleasure antenna that if it goes so soon, the market lake is broken. I saw the shirt. To drink socially every day. (Laughter) The first apartment in the beach, old politicians, antidepressants, a void. The middle crisis. The encounter with college colleagues. My God spent a few years fast, huh? Life is short. Children in school. My Gods, as they grew fast. In life, it's short. Teds well cut by the center's faith. You're a principal. You're anonymous society. The first place. After weekend in the beach, at the end of the mountain. Let's sell the apartment of the beach, children grow up and don't even want to go further. The pianist, the shirt. The external thing is a little high. Her classic body, as an astronaut here spent years, struggled in zero gravity. (Laughter) None car, on account of the healthy habit of going to the edge, puts all the infections. (Laughter) Blue has "Fi," "Lactose and cold," "Sucoverde." Speaking of the academic semester that you used for two months. It's fourth, ugly day. They're hamburgers after being late in the movie, they've made a project because life is too short to eat it easy. The vice-president, who, despite all efforts, has never arrived, probably never arrived. The continuous fear of losing a job. We don't value more experience. The fear of everything. From the new generations, the change, the new one. Because in my time, fear continues that prevents you from living. Fear of death. A liver feeling of suffocation. Where is the air? Otherwise I'm focused. The complete disconnection with your children is decorative of 12 hours of work decades. The empty retirement surrounded by useless and little affection. You're a winner. This is your only consumption. Your life is executive, executive. It's a shirt of wood for the true time. Thank you. (Applause)
