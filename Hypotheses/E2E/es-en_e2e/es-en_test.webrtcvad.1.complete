(Music) (Applause) I have a message for their children and grandchildren. And I need you to help me swimming. It's very simple. (Applause) We need to learn to feel. To think and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lombocan Strait, in Indonesia. At 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity of recipes, corals, tortures, mold fish. And from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature. It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience. So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish, from foreigns. Negers and yellow came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me. We were looking at each other. And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself. It was a very spiritual feeling, and that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right? It's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell you, look at each other. And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy." (Laughter) And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. B.G: The 24-hour work, during a week, to draw that artwork we're going to see, or the opposite, the maritime stream would take it. It proves that nature has consciousness. And that I'm not crazy. What if I'm able to talk to fish? Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, with rocks, with mountains, and with other natural phenomena? I think so. In fact, I bring you more scientific tests. Last year, the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed. Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of 3/4 companies and predators, that is, for every four bottles there were three lions. Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? In other words, paradoxically, according to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced. I agree with the law of Cleber. A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse. But three rooms. And if they stop thinking about it... The planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right? So I ask myself: Is it a mer coincidence? Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness? After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution. That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research. That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify. The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the human being, I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development. And I remember, with the scientific consensus, with the explosion of the Big Times, the Universe came up to 13,700 million years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4,000 500 and 5,000 million years, and during the first half of this period, the formed in very simple places. With the appearance of oxygen book in the atmosphere, which domesticated animals and plants to 10,000 years ago, and especially from the Korea Revolution of the Kurassic period, in the actuality, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that cohabits and co-evolution in the planet Earth, with the Exclusion of agricultural Revolution, which has been developed in the first cells and the depths. But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed. It's like something unbearable. I'm 113 species. In a 30-year-old Parliament or maybe 100 million species? A single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of the species. And that's if it's crazy and we're all responsible. (Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs. But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him. In this half of the 20th century, and the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them. So, if it seems we've forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, equivalent to the thermal fusion of stars that can reach 65 million degrees. And if that was little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our Earth mother. Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth. (Applause) Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity. According to the World Forum of nature? If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours. But we don't have four planets, right? That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. In addition, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming, and what does this mean? Imagine that we will be the doors and the windows of this theater. And we take fire to the bottles in which you are sitting down. Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. A chronic scenario of natural resources will be able to develop in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate, Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, those who better adapt to the environment, but they forgot to define the concept of cooperation. (Laughter) If it's true that there is violence and predation and excess, in any way. In life, in nature, what defines it is what defines it. I'll give you an example: it's not competition, but cooperation, imagine millions of spermatozoids running fighting, competing to reach a novel, to fertilize it. What defines life is not a competition, but a symbiotic union has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one. That defines life, cooperation. The football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with all the technical body behind it. Our body is a pluricelular organism where millions of cells cooperate where millions of cells do what we are. Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to achieve sustainable societies, but human beings do create ideology of linear thinking, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time, has suffered catastrophes of meteorites and constant processes of trial and error. Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed the communism that also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has also failed, has more money than the rest of 99. That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren. That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because nature is signed to obtain economic benefits, we've sent to the outside space and nuclear recipes at the bottom of the sea. The money has colonized life. And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. I see life, my my mythical imitation, imitation of life, but this is not new, this is already doing it in the originary villages, the indigenous people, for thousands of years. And it's something inside us, we all have that faculty, and I invite you to play a game. Imagine what happens to you with this veruga: How could the engineers, architects, economists, inspire us? Well, for them a plane came up. What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"? Well, the Japanese did the train "Vala." And with this Murciélago. We could make a trunk, right? (Laughter) And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites. We could make bioclimatic buildings. With this Girasol. A plant of solar boards. As we know, there are millions of species in nature. Bio-inspiration is practically infinite. But do we keep thinking that nature ... It will be there forever. And we have to overcome the cognitive false of the GDP, which means GDP. To climb so much percent of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material. For the industry. We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren. And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started? Can you imagine? A future to dialogue with their children and grandchildren. I would like you to tell me, "Daddy." At least you try it, fight. And you. What would you like to hear? Thank you very much (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) And what I want to tell you is that the quarantena doesn't belong to us, and the candle doesn't provide me, they are terrible things, we spoke about it all we need. But it has many complicated opportunities, politically. With my moment, huh? We're wrong, socially with goods, we're going to our friends. This doesn't happen at all, it doesn't matter what to think, it's an opportunity that we have to take advantage of and that it's a great moment to learn, it's a big moment for anything, it's a horrible moment. In fact, life is not about something else, that happens horrible moments and learning from them: we learn pain, disease. We give them war, death, if we do it, if we're going to keep doing it. I don't even know what. That's what we're going to do now. And I think I'm not going to enter. It's an idea in which I was meditating, from a book. It's called "The Modern Athroeza," that the film is "The Rexarmon." They are the newspapers that Germán arrived in the 80s, when the diagnosis of HIV, and then he decides to turn his childhood to the gardenery, three exams is a sign that, in fact, was diagnosed. They are a lot of movies, very important questions, some of the most important spaces of their career. But what he decides is that he's going to buy a land in a horrible place. It was going to take care of a garden. And what was impressive. As a person, how does it write? It's that for him, taking care of a garden wasn't doing time. It wasn't, well, passing the route. Not like now that we spend the time cooking, making bread or whatever. Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks you've experienced are those." And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism. From Figengers, basically. And that, more specifically, the feminist weapon. To talk about reproductive work, it's not even the productive work, which is the one that puts new things in the world, we can say, that is, always to my father or a key, it doesn't matter, and this is the reproductive work that reproduces the conditions so that we can do that, clean, cook, care, right? Thank you very much. I had to cook the workers for the next day to put the factory, their reproductive work. And the feminist took a long time, right? By increasing, correctly, that reproductive work is also work. But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to make productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory. Now, why the fat of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value? It's even more, why don't we do it as a rejection and think that difference is contrast? Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more infective difference given by one side. Of course, gender, there are areas that are important, these are the productions, traditionally internalized by the aurorae. And reproductive reproductive revolves through women are important. And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the original subject, the world that the subject takes care of. No, take care of it. It's something that doesn't make you special, you're not originating, you're an artist, you don't make you think, you don't make you an important thing, right? These are values we don't have to accumulate. Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days? We are living without advertising, without writers. I mean, a lot of things were moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning, but the world didn't go spinning without food and without care. Without nurses and no health. The only thing that allows us today? Is it comar? It's cool. What a beautiful thing! And without that, the world magic. That's it. Those tasks... They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value. And not only that, but what? It's not just something mechanical that we have to go through the river, that hope it won't exist, pick it up, make it like that, clean it almost, cook, not only see the food. We can think about it like this, we have thought it for a long time. But what I thought when I read to Germans is that... Just as well, to live them in a different way. Can we live them? Like tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have. We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what the title is not modern nature, modernity. Human beings have separated from the natural world. Only do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but also the relationship of care with nature. It's also interesting. The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that there's someone to take care of the body, there's the gym or cook. Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter. He looked at me. This is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are. And that the body will do something we have to overcome. Does it look like me? This is not an opportunity. And, in fact, I want to return to my life. No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is. No, we all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity. Now. "There's another world that needs more novels." I thought, "Well. Why not? Instead of obsessed with being productive in these days. And to know all the colds and with all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the careers, with others, in another way, from that? That's why, when they invited me to do this, I don't know, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide another novel and the world didn't need any other idea. But that's why I thought about taking care of what I had with my books and I wanted to tell other people, right? More than writing, reading? And more, what to do? Remember. Thank you very much (Applause) People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat. No more bread, no more sweet, no more posters, every 15 days. A end of the middle. These foods don't fat. What matters is the dismissioned and disordened way we consume them. That's why I want to name you. Three key aspects. To have a good food. The first is consciousness. (Laughter) Once a teacher told me: "The consciousness is secondary to the brain activity." And with brain activity, losing experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious. Our wishes, our beliefs. So, if the consciousness rate is secondary to our desires? We would never choose a food we didn't want to eat. But on the contrary, the one that doesn't like the most. And after this, are we aware of what we are feeding, what are we eating? And in which quantity? A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger. Because when we have a man, it's not a man of a man. The hunger of everything, the vorasiest and the most caloric. And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attentive, right? The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas. To see, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double wealth. Thank you very much. So ... Going back to the subject. Are we really capable? That is, pizza. Thank you very much, I prefer a Wardolph. Impossible, right? The second aspect is practice: to eat. Like every process in life, it learns. And in this case, and in many cases. That my include reains to learn. We must learn to eat in station. What does this mean? Let's see, eating the food that have been harassed at that time. This will guarantee us a control and a balance in our weight and putting a god in our health. (Laughter) Because foods are made of their own, of their time. They are the most natural foods. They are the richest foods in nutrients and they are not chemically treated to subsist in time. In other words, they are not additioned with calories. And necessary for our body. Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or is it normal to drink tomatoes in winter and summer? So this mechanism has led to practice. It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating the same. The last aspect? For me, it's not smaller, but it's from the most important ones in moderation. Thank you very much. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxieties. And I have a question. They also give them anxieties. Repeting the plate of purchasing with frites? To think, right? So, what do we do? What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates? That hunger is not handling. Yes, they restrict food if they get out of food. What is not consumed in the day will be consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion. To be the graphicest is like a snowball that comes from the top. Every time with more size, every time with more volume. And every time with more strength. So, if we don't stop each three. Four hours. To take a collapse. That snowball will unfold in a boring way. In the first moment we have the opportunity to eat. And we're going to disappoint all the food around us. (Audience) Yes! And to finish... Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to do, the weight I'm going to lose and not. In other words, the most expensive body becomes to reserve. Keep it. And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body. Let's go. The food doesn't only make you fat. Let's leave, please, of ignorance. The food can hurt you or cure you, it depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and in what amount. I return to moderation. That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation. This food stimulates overweight. To give it a closet. I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like. Being a varied, but always taking care of the portion. And not for anything there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "They die as a prince" and "sene" as I mentioned. I think many of us know it. (Laughter) The health has excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have, I'm there." "It happened to me hunger, or even worse." Sometimes I died of hunger. We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly. Thank you very much (Applause) (Music) (Applause) A while ago I came obsessed by telling stories of scientific women: I love the first one that seemed obvious to me, Marie Curie. They didn't give a Nobel Prize, they were two, so they deserved their pedestal, but there were many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they made incredible things, recently I entered the story of Ugeneas Ardote. Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war, and they say it was very copied that you could talk to her, and you know that it died in 2004, and it was big contributions, among them, the most important was the one that brought the vaccine against the poly in the university 100 years. (Applause) I found her very little, very bronca, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who went, but, above all, to not lose those who are, thank you very much. (Applause) How did I lose her? (Music) (Applause) We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography. Kids keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. Do we need a new ortography? I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think it's necessary to simplify what we already have. And the question and the answer are new in our language, they come to bounce back in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Castellan language. Antonio de Nebrijas sat for our ortography, a clear and simple principle. That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write. Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today. It's because Spanish, unlike other languages, like English or French. There was always a strong resistance to write too different from how we pronounced, but it's not because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing. There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological. The one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with dead acts we write, but we don't pronounce. That's how we stayed with long and short waves that, unlike what many people never believed in the pronouncement of the Spanish. That's how we create congeses, that sometimes sound as "aspers" as in people, and sometimes they sound soft, like a fool, so we stay with thesis, heces. There are three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but none to three. I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience. We all went to school, we all invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and infant brain, indicated. In the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions. They transmitted us in many simplic and explicit ways the idea that in ortography something was fundamental in our training. However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled? What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less transcendental than what they usually believe. Ortography is used to uniform writing. so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it. But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example, in ortography there is no individual, involved ability. In punctuation, yes. With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase, with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no. With ortography, or it's OK, or it's bad, according to you or not to be adjusted to the old norms. But then it wouldn't be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms so that all that time we dedicate them to the teaching of ortography? We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort. What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want. The language is a common use tool, and therefore it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria. But it also seems fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done. Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down when ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all. I work every day with the literature of the Ourolego's century, Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo, that sometimes they write: "Men, sign, sometimes they write, write, with a decoration." And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality. But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story, I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive with which teachers kick us and knock us with ortography. But the truth is that being things like you are, that makes sense. In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content. Of what you're writing, you can get or stop getting a job for an H, that I put or stopped putting. You can become an object of public bubble for a misunderstanding bird. So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography. But we shouldn't forget. Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers or linked to the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed ortography, sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge. In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had place in Spanish language, which was the Chile of media. In the 19th century. Because then, I'm going to take the position of those teachers and start moving forward in our ortography, I'm here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. Audience: Yes! We eliminate HMUDA, where we wrote an H. But we didn't pronounce anything, we chose to be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to feed, we don't with one, we eliminate the other: "Geeeeeeee, I'll divide the feeling, I can justify for someone." Garave, giraffe, people. Argentine. And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the difference of pronouncement must be attended, now I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two and three letters, we go down to two. We're all better: some of these changes can seem a little dramatic, they're not so much the Real Academy, all the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified. That language is connected to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that attachment to history, traditions and customs are transformed into an obstacle. And for today's use, that explains that our language is much more. That those we know, that we have geographically close to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol. And little by little, now they start to remove themselves exhausely some moved haches in the dictionary of the academy: harp, harmony, they can write with H or Sinache. And we're all fine. Does it look like me? This is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion. (Laughter) We always say that language changes spontaneously from below to above, which are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications. And that authority, in some places, is a academic in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts them and incorporates them. This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that has always historically changed from above to down, there were always the institutions that fixed the norms. And they proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use it speaks? But at our time, the time of social networks. This is suffering a revolutionary change. It's never been described as much as now, and in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school using novelous ortographic use. where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks. It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication for now. There are chaotic, individual users, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that signs writing to a new place is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would be wrong to reject them. To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinement with the needs of our times. Audience: Yes. I can anticipate some objections. Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic. With a simplified ortography, we're going to recover etymology at the same place we're going now, to the etymological dictionary. A second operation of those who say, "If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguising between these words that today are different in only one lyrics, that's true, but it's not a problem, our language has the bench where we deposit the money, the suit that we don't confuse them in any confusion." But there's a third objection. For me? The most comprehensible, even the most moving, which is the one they say, "I don't want to change," "I educate myself like this," "I get used in this way when I read a word written in ortography, simplified, "I hurt my eyes." (Laughter) That objection is within each one of us. What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to? And it is expected that time feels the new norms. The success of all ortographic renovation that touches so arraigated habits is in the prudence, consensus, gradualism and tolerance. But we can't let the rule, the old customs, encourage us to move forward. The best tribute we can agree with, that the academics have to agree and clean from our ortography, the best tribute we have to put in the past is to improve what we receive. All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us. I'm convinced that if we do that in the modest environment, but very important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a future. Better ... (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes. I had the eyes coffee with a joy around the Liris. And saying to myself, don't forget your eyes. After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death. Well, maybe for my training as a photographer. Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope. For the surprise of all scientists I approached monocromatic images. The discovery I made transformed my view of the world. The whole universe inside my mind. It was like being floating in the universe. It was like being that space. A space that is tangible, without body. It was absolute content. It became peace. This image. Do you see it? That's the image of the seeds of my microscope father. And this is another one. It's the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite. All my fear and my sadness disappeared. You don't feel disconnection from anything or anyone. His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life. Now let's see the project. For me, this is teaching. That our most pure material essence. We are scared by the cosmos. And that when we look into the mirror, there are perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe in. And that matter is not created nor destroyed. It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. Thank you (Applause) (Music) (Applause) In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy. And space technology. His satellites travel around the planet. It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating. We shouldn't create an invasion of education. Imagine a public agency that designs content and strategies to transform learning. That I work with schools to rewrite what classrooms happen. That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale. A agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you. For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term. They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management. The first step is to think of the state as a possibility. Not like the variable of all the adjusts. Just like that, changes in education will not benefit the most advantages (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I'm not a scientist, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations. From big loves, extraterrestrial invasions. Until pandemic. Until the fiction made reality. And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves questions. From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide. For example, the world's obsession would buy mountains of hygiene paper. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous. Who is an unconscious logic? In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer. It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive. And the failure lives with more relief if we know we had made a great effort to try to remedy it. It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public. And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology, called optimistic blind. The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we speak on the phone or worse, while we send messages. Thinking that, in fact, won't happen to us anything? It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals. Why does this happen to us now? Unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas. For example, in the bobonic fish the Jews in Europe and in the Chinese, in San Francisco, in the United States. When, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease. In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick with other people. However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs. This first makes people who are healthy or count and this is very important, but there's another most important reason: if they don't use maskets, we get sick. So this would be a sort of accusatory excuse, to know who is sick and who doesn't because they use no more squares. That they use it all over the world, it's a way of avoiding the self-esteem. We have to take care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered the most in these days is our extraordinary capacity for change. In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do it. This is what we have discovered now, for years we think that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it. And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home. We don't know some consequences of this. But we learned that we are willing to do it is the premature need, and the world keeps moving. And also, of course, they change our values, our judgment. It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started. The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible then. That everyone has to stay at home, it completely seems priority. And if on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment? It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future. Imagine the next situation. We are at the beginning of the pandemic. A public consensus that includes the Organization of the Salud. But also Government and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we are. And also data of our body intimacy. Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our viral load. And you can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of getting infected and who. Let's suppose that this consortion can use this information to restore the movement of people in a specific way, the one who is at home, the one who is at risk, can go out. And we keep this mental experiment imagining that with this we really keep the effect of epidemic. It doesn't disappear completely, but it dies a lot less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk they make a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic and you could choose if it looks good or bad to do this? What would you do? I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is. On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values of our culture. And on the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics. Maybe we see our data a little like vaccinating us. It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact. To take care of us. And everyone. A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom. We found a good solution of commitment. Compreservative sex. When all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free and careful at the same time? Are you going to fly less airplanes in a sky? Will we change the way we greet? Are we going to be part of our treatment as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever. (Applause) What do we want the sex to be the conservative sex of the coronavirus? (Applause) (Music) My first encounter with a fossil. It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina. I had been many times in museums, with full of dinosaurs that fascinated me. But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nowhere. A animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before. (Sounds) The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind, we call it "dolars of sea," are relatives from sea herits. And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years. So, at that moment... I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out. And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know. They are extremely fragile: the dollar of March broke down the sand. And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way. But I'm interested in fossil fuels, nor fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past. They followed me captivating and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet. About 100 million years ago. Our planet was very different as the one today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated. For dinosaurs and other raptile groups. And I told you 100 million years ago. It's a quantity that we, paleontologists, mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stadium, which are many people. Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people. 10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a amount. That it doesn't enter the head. And that multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life. It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter. In your head. But well, life led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago. I've traveled for deserts and fossil studies of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa. I'm studying fantastic fossils, but it has also led me. A very special place. What is Patagonia and when we say Patagonia? Naturally, we think of these landscapes, forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes. But for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils. What do they want to be discovered? We know, fortunately, many dinosaurs of Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs live in Earth. What we call critical period, this is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere. The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios. While, at that time, in the northern hemisphere, other carnivores gathered, like the dinosaurs, for example. Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of the South was not surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated isolated the continents of the North hemisphere. But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call "jurassic period," 100 million years earlier? At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea. And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the Kurassic, in the south hemisphere. And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet. Her key man, especially 170 million years ago. When dinosaurs for the first time. They dominated the planet completely. For the first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores of omnivores all over the planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagon's curasic. And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found it four years ago, locked up like this, walking. A afternoon of a lot of heat? After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks on the floor. And I got closer, as I got closer, it was becoming clearly what it was. It was the traffic of where it opens us. I approached, stood next to me, stood up, really. I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what the track of a carnivor dinosaur was. But really? I couldn't believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life. Then, to warn the rest of the team. And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of... To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers layers, as we do to transport it to the museum. And we started to take it low. But the expedition was over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum. Until the next time given the winter came. It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the channel we had found. Or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day of the statition. We realized it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rarely. In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions. Clearly, the animal was dead. A layer of a lake and she has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way her sketch. And then he begins the scavation: reading, staying, cap, cap, those sediments that were shaking. It's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time it's going back to the surface an animal that lived in that same place for 170 million years. Guys, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediment layers, that they were accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediments caps, and that food was transforming into sedentary rocks. And in that same process, bones were transforming themselves into fossils for chemical reactions. Then all that package of sepultated rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming. From all this block. And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover. The layers I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills, looking for... Those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting. And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun. The Patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry. All this rest is protected by layers to the lab. In the lab, the museum begins another extremely long stage, where technicians, with infinite patience. They are removing grain to grain. All the rocks that cover these dinosaurs' bones. And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizáurus. Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was an ancestor of those carnivores of the south hemisphere. And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before. What we thought: much before the South hemisphere and the North hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent. Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there. For example, of some rocks like these that we carry to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside. We were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rock blocks. The challenge was quite complete and told with a very well preserved meat and with some very strange teeth. Dents in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "man and Dance." Now, this dinosaur is very particular, in addition to something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replication of the channel of this dinosaur. And this mini dinosaurs didn't look like in anything to the forms we found or met from the North hemisphere, studying their rest we could see that their closest relatives... They had been found in South Africa, rocks of the same old age, and this wasn't so surprising because if you see this in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to this time of Pangea. Or you haven't graduated in the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents today. But we had a case again. of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and they had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere. We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern. And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that live in this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century. It was a great success what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere; it was the lack of water, what had isolated these fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water. Thank you very much. And when we think about dinosaurs... And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are really fascinating organisms. They have challenged the limits of the body size, the history of life. They have diversified and conquered all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing is that. It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet. And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives. Learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. The Earth is a big book. With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years. Life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years. There are millions of pages yet by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today. It's fundamental to know your story. Because knowing the past. It's key to understand the present. "Yes." (Applause) (Music) It's also key to design a future, thanks. (Applause) (Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers. anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies. I dreamed of competing. To contain magical powers to build things. I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors. Well, time ... It's not a reality bathroom. It loses subtle and you don't have the magical variety of thesearry potatoes. I see without empathic periods that I wanted to leave. And you don't have the passion of patterns to defend them. But something about that child's vocation? It was in me and almost without realizing it. I dedicated myself to looking. And to try to understand how these superpowers work. They are not my imagination. But it's not the real world. Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers. Maybe the most important thing in this situation is to live. What is the superpower of thinking better? Obviously, there are many more superpowers. And many more tools to think better. But today I want to focus on which I think are less known. I'm going to tell you about my ideas, or I learned from others. And this is perhaps the main idea of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you. That we are able to learn. And that our ability to think is not given or is fixed. But it can be developed. Putting our mind with powerful and practicing ideas. So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine they enter a gym. Look at those on the floor, turn around, separate your empty, bicycles, daughters. They go to the bar, ask for a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and it will be comfortable. It doesn't work like that, right? Our body doesn't improve with this. Well, compensating happens the same. It doesn't count being able to think. What counts is to think. We have to practice, think. They develop the habit of thinking and give time to think. Intelligence is not something that has or doesn't have. It's something we use or we don't use. The second. Do you see the saying? The one who only sees a martle sees all the problems as a keyboard. But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress. Not to realize their keyboard. If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing. And if we need to cut something, we need a bear. To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems. And tools are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model. As if we were trying to get a 2,000 with a noise. If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful. But where do these mental models find? Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times. For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology. And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina. In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ. In the average age and in our time. To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads. "No." All the problems will seem uncled. It's the third. Little by little I was in the club and at the table of the side, a man told his friends. He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher. Go ahead of his son and his classmates. For a mistake, the teacher had committed. The man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher. He didn't realize it. What? What? What? In other words, this. I was creating a much greater evil. In Switzerland. I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends. And I was unleasant to the teacher. In front of all the children who had to learn from him. Many times we don't realize it. To be focused on earning a scale. It makes us have success in that scale. And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another most important scale. To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example. No money, freedom, no freedom, no freedom and losing love. When we act, we think what impact are we going to do? And what is the most important scale in which we have to think like acting? And the fourth? The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. And the impression generates emotions. And emotions make us act. For example, in the pandemic. A lot of Chinese situations arrived. But those acts didn't generate impressions. They generated emotions. And that's not how we act. When they started to get there. Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China. These simple expressions were emotion, fear. And the fear of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what is going well. We were lucky that fear gave us time. Because someone has come to us before. But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel. The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. To get married is something: you have hunger. Have you got married? You have an immediate reward that eat what you get married. But cultivating is very different, does effort now? It will take something that will take advantage of six months or a half. This is the pillar of almost everything we have. But earning generates applause. Because something is avoiding. That nobody is a benicient. But except lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling. That is to say, to develop our ability to anticipate. It's one of the main skills to think well. Let's think a minute. What do we have to anticipate? Now... That we still feel, we live. In China? We all evaluate things according to our expectations. If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last six months. We are happy. If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last one month, we're sad. It's the same time, it's three months. But we live them completely different. If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example. At kilometers, we are exhausted. If we program to run 20. Nine kilometers are unbearable. Let's take a point of resilience. But the key to resilience is to handle the expectations well. The sex is worthwhile. Have you ever met a well-known place? You're walking through a chicken in the middle of the swimming pool. A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago. You can't create an unlikely chance to find yourself in that place. That's true, finding that classmate, in that place, is something totally unlikely. But how do we know so many people? It's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place. In fact, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of the same life, are there so many unlikely things? It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us. The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future. We don't know what will happen. Neither now, my field with more formal times. We have to learn to live with uncertainty. And it was better the intelligent way to coexist with the uncertainty. To always leave many open doors. Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of when it's possible, even if they're very likely. And if someone ever asks you? Why do you always have cars with the tank of Nasta lleno? Contestal. Because once you find yourself in a village on the other side of the world. With a high school classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years. I told you at the beginning that I wanted to do with this talk. Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn. And learning has to do with being accepted. To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking. And from people. With which we cultivate these ideas. To be able of people who enrich our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others. It's about changing our own ideas. A interview for 40 years, the interview Domis is a question. And when Borges replied: The interviewer told me, "This same, you answered to me." That same question four years ago. Borfies, I don't know what I've done. He looked at him. And he said: I ask for excuses. It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years. Let's take advantage of this limit moment that makes us live? To be made of new ideas. From the new ideas that are emerging and being always open to change our way of thinking. Thank you (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Women are irrational beings. Always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family. At the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of. This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for the education of girls and young girls about marriage. That circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930. But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915 no country in the world could vote. In 2015, that is, in 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women. In 1910 (Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize. (Applause) But the academic science academic and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979: 36 years ago. Many of you here have already finished the primary. The University of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, left a woman to be a master's degree. Hale University admired women in 1972. The Prince University recently in 1974, and we could continue and follow. This was the idea that women only serve to create children and help their husband. It's a rational series, which is hystéric. It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment. And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they believed this idea. It was a true fact. Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed? Because we're living the political revolutions we've lived in the economic system, if you're all living, the most amazing transformation, the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm. The idea that truth is a lie, there are no facts, there are only interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world. 2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem. Now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the goal world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it. When you say that there is no fact, that there are interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a kind of personal delirium. That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. What is an interpretative mark, what day is it? 24th of September. Does anyone doubt it? What day do you stop? (Laughter) Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because we're all here, we agree with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, or more than 500. On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think: That we are part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, places live without a calendar. My dog, Chiap, Alkeador, and who is very lonely at home. No, making some misfortune. I didn't know the time, I knew what I was going back now. It doesn't look at the clock. If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world? That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree. He looked at me to fall in a blanket, wrote the law of gravity: "What a genius!" But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution. They had lacked the trips I made, to know the animals I saw, all those who had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides... To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print. It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea. The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it. The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born. But he was born in the 19th century. The same happens with relativity, the same thing happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation, that are increasingly more developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts only exist in interpretations, when we go to the economic and social field, the revolutionary change. As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and raised the children. And, however, in less than 100 years, countries governed half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost for humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything more than to clean panels. How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity ... In other words, errones ideas are monsters. There is an idea we can do it. To follow because it was created a century and a half ago, and that example, to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality. Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world. You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, the relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, in all times." They are even documented in many species of animals outside of humans. But I had never thought that sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally, sexual identity. It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A. Moral Victorian, who was one of the great forms of social control during a century and a kid. The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex when something we want to do doesn't have turbies. You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you fault, it's not true, it's a great social control... (Applause) You don't give the woman of your fellow man. (Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man. (Laughter) It will give you guilt, it will give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it, and then that's a form of terrible social control because it dominates us, probably, on the one hand, you know we can't leave, it's as if they were given us to eat. We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, there was a waste bathroom where everything that was bad in the society of the sexual point of view was put there. The homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks that neuroscience went from slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves. It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, none of the situations today is ideal. But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century. In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still donating blood, this is just raising now, and in many parts of the world, we didn't have the right for 50 years, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina were still condemned to be fusilated. But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal, this was possible, because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all depressed, take their identity, respect and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full right. To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish. So that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, like a black man, only black, and the same thing as gay. And if you win the women, the Jews, the blacks, the white, we are all complete, complex people, contradictories, that maybe I don't have to win, what am I doing, but, however, we have to accept that? Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison. Thank you very much (Applause) 50 years ago? Look how old I am. I was a homosexual child. I didn't know what a homosexual child was, I didn't know the homosexual word, and they didn't tell me like that, my colleagues told me: "I agree, I put you, we're going to turn you off." (Laughter) "Trolo, don't look at me." I didn't even know what to do, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything, and at the same time. I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was. I went back home, from school, and I saw that my father, who loved me, looked at me. And I started to feel what would I have done so that it come out like that. What was it like that? I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual. I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. To assume the identity there was in the positive side. I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, to do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. I stopped being a person. And I'm a person, like any other person in the world, I'm against victory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings. And it took me 50 years to learn. That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay at 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity. 20 or 30 years ago this idea I had. The facts that arise to understand that there are no facts. (Laughter) (Applause) contradictions and babies, because in fact that's it, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend myself, and when we only have a head doesn't serve us. I made her body, I left prison. And I left my prison, it was so wonderful. Do you think jail is? (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Have you ever told me that there is a list of things we need to survive, called the basics channel? What idea of living constantly with this canasta, Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to survive, and if better we had the things we need to explore? But exploring is something difficult, terrifying, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement leads us extraordinary situations, to adapt is a moment, long or small time. When everything you did, you've paid for the voices of someone else, you've had a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstacles it. But once you say it, once you make your words, you get a avalanche of ideas that come towards you all speed. Each of these ideas looks like a bomb, that looks for exterminating, but some of these ideas are rain, and you have to choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side, and in part with each one of them. But learning to accomplish this movement is a combination of energy, deciding to get out of jumping or running, but learning to fulfill this movement is something complicated: learning to damage your own movement. A class is not bad. With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing, and that even if life controls music, movements believe it. Moments. That they keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be an art work, but they would allow you to review the exact way those stars saw. In the formula you saw that guy, when he spoke about what he loved the most, the ratie is the one who raises your heart. Or how do you start when I spoke, that voice? That quest so much you know, that you probably are looking for something you lose. That voice, your best friend, go for it and always. It will be the first to defend yourself, the first part of the puzzle to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it. That person is your best friend. A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, if it's a nickname, I can't survive. (Music) (Music) (Music) (Applause) I'm sure that we didn't choose. I don't say opportunity to get rid of it. Very black to be ... I can't go to state work, I can't progress in the way I would like to. And there, a person always appears for what they will have been in years. Keep calm and with a belly, you remember your experience, if you don't get an American. Do you remember that all the time spent was better? Chip! Is this really like that? Or maybe? We don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us. To think about this. Unfortunately, I remember my friends of all life, and Juancho, Franco and Manuel. These photos that are seeing there. It's 2009 when I live in secondary school. What can I tell you about my friends? That I really want them to be like my brothers. And that there are three superable people. That, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to be able to stay for the power I liked. They stayed at each city. And go to surprise, to the day of today. You can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams. As for me, I want to be in this picture. The lack of opportunities is also made present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort on humans so that I could study what I liked. Because I knew that I didn't even know that if I stayed here in the city. I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be short of opportunities. Have you ever wondered why these things happen? Children have been among one. We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization. In which successes and advances become a speed that surprise us all. And it deprives the borders and the barriers that insist between people. And in this context? Cities to make more and more important cities. Let's do the sincero, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. It is estimated that in 2050. 68% of the world's population will live in a city. Because if that number doesn't sound to you. I'd have to be almost 10 people in the whole world. Seven out of every day. If there are more people, they choose to live in cities. And he says, "Calledo, we have more chances to cry." That's it. What do they explain, then, that while the city stops falling in time, other progresses, vibrants, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them? I'm going to tell you a key word that I wanted you to record here when you get out of that door to return home. This is the strategy. If we want globalization to help us to provide more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. Part of my concern as a professional future in the field of International Relations, it happens precisely for this. To connect cities? With the opportunities that the world has to offer us. Not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities. And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. Now you'll tell me, "How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?" Through concrete projects. What improves the quality of life of the population? And they avoid migration to other places searching for a better future. Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends. This is a photo a few months ago, and so you can write a couple of things to start. Let's add a fifth to my opinion, it's a group. Do you know what it is? The drink of alcohol. Secondly, we can also say that it is given a kind of universal relationship in proportional. As they were improving the quality of the photos of the phones. (Laughter) Some have a couple of threads, and others have to be happy, but what we were going to improve. Do you know what we share today beyond the deep time we have students with us? The lack of opportunities. Is it white? For example, the one that is also made in this picture. [A.DE.] It was a national champion of geography loneliness in 2002. A national champion. But today, although it's left to dedicate to studying a school teacher, it doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday working to be able to live. Then try support. It's the one who's left below, who just goes to his audience. I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to extract in one of the security for the country. But, as I didn't count with that possibility here, since then I'm changing the career without finding what really was passionate about. And I can't get a job that allows seven economical dependencies. Finally, it's Manuel, who is a genius of illustration, but they don't know the geniuses, they give them anything. Do you realize it? Every day working in their local that built from nothing itself. Go to college to study programming. And you can't develop your potential and keep learning what you like, because you can't find necessary tools for lack of presupport to your diversity. Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study. But the worst of all this I'm telling you about. "That's it!" We, as young people, don't have it. Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing. Stop! I recently had the huge fortune to be the election between a group of 8 young children at a worldwide level. To participate in a week in New Day and the capital of India. I traveled in the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentine in that event. (Audience) Yes! Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back. I learned a lot. But there are two things I would like to share with you today. They are following. One, one. There are millions. And I will never be able to say it with enough bottles so that you can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities outside. For all tastes and for all colors. But there are discourse found, they don't come alone. In one of the two. But not less important. Our human resources, as Argentines, are brilliant, we don't have one to deal with young people, teenagers, children, nor anyone. Do you know what the differences we don't have? What do you want? And a state that is present to get out of the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them. Once again. If we want better cities, we take strategically to the world. Remember? When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could stop studying. With three days to fulfill 18 years. I was very scared, with a lot of fear. This can never tell you in public. Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult for your city. What to study? It's like leaving a piece of your heart. Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by. What is this for? I don't have to go to the pocket. Who are the friends? And nobody you know? It's necessary to give the tools to our young people so they stay in their cities and grow from there. In the end, who's more beautiful? To give them wings to the city you had to do. And with a strategy we can do it. That's it. Imagine the brilliant. "What would it have been strange?" If I could dedicate myself completely to geography. Or how much? If today they had one of the strengths of security in our country. Or to give us so far away in Manuel. If I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I like. "Ah, yes?" Ah, yeah! "Thank you." You've already lacked opportunities. Thank you. All of this. And I'm telling you. Doesn't it seem enough to you? Do you want more example? Stop! Let's see. [A.DE.] "And you?" It's the tattoo. And they tell me, "When, finally, I could overcome the deep black depression." In which I fell, I'll have to go to college. Twenty of suicide. In numeral, psychological sequels. I liked it all. Thank you very much, very much. If we want these things to stop passing? We have to go out strategic to change this world. Please. We don't add a final point to our cities. Thank you very much (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I'm a surgeon. Since always, surgeons... We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. In my last 10 years? My research ... In my case, in the zoo, the reasons were based on looking for. To operate less and less to patients. This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes. To detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair. For themselves. Using their own ability to regenerate: we do this with biological platforms that are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own capacity. To restore yourself after a damage. And finally, with new technologies... We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures. And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out. Robotics are giving us a lot of tools. To facilitate these tasks. What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate gave me many satisfactions. Do you like me? And even a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly invasive. I have more and more work. (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I would like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. Thank you. I'm not a doctor. My mother is Japanese and I think that certain behaviors and sociological answers of Japanese culture can help us when facing a crisis like this, literary societies, social and individuals. It's worth asking us a first question. Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage? If in January the first case came out, being so close to the neighbour. Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space. Having the population of third age, older people in the world, being the second country with more smoke for many inhabitants. Why the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth in Japan? And the certificate, but a linear progress. Until now. (Laughter) We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious. In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease. Many people, in little place. And a room of that people with more than 65. What happens then? Japanese is a society educated in such a way that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it. Japanese went through wars, Tifones, tsunami. Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year. 1,000 temblors per day. Generation, transgeneration, has had to overcome catastrophes. Natural or generated by man. We can think about football teams with something that likes the Argentines a lot, like an example. What soccer team will have better performance before a critical moment? The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do. Or the team that never entered. It doesn't have infrastructure. And it has to come out to improvise. of social distancing, directives. And genes, hygiene, and individual behavior are associated with their own house. The Japanese population hasn't established for hundreds of years, doesn't have to hug. Don't give kiss, because they don't do it. He greets with a reverence. Daring distance is a gesture of respect, and most workers in public places use a lot. It's not necessary to recommend to get out of shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used. So we don't have to indicate "non't be harmful about another person." Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese. In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected. Not to protect yourself, but to protect others. Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture. It's the good of everything. It's more important than the good of one part. In Japan, to illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan. I will surely know the game of the chairs. You put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and you get out of one. In each round. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all, made this experience in Japan. Keeping the place to a classmate. Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers. The word "how" expresses this way of being, it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me, in resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others. In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works. Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone. (Applause)
