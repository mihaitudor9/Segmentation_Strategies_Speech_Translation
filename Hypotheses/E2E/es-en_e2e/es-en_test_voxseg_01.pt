I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me swim.
It's very simple.
So we need it.
In other words, learning to feel, thinking and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the sketch of Lomboca, Indonesia, at 30 meters below water, with that feeling of ungratulated, surrounded by a great biodiversity of tortures, of mold fish, of all colors.
I had a feeling of being connected with nature, it was a mystical and spiritual experience very profound.
So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Are you fragile?
And blacks and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me.
We were looking at it, right?
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling, and what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, it's the same thing my students think at the university every time I tell him, look at each other.
And they say, "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy.
And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist.
So he works 24 hours during a week.
To draw that artwork we're going to see.
On the contrary, the maritime stream would take it: that mandate we see proves that nature has consciousness and that I don't develop it.
And if I'm able to talk to fish.
Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena, I think yes?
Last year, the Scientific magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed.
(Laughter) Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between predators, that is, for every four bottles there were three lions, or, on the contrary, wouldn't it be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, from amazing forms to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced.
I agree with the law of Claiver, an elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse, but three rooms.
And if they stop thinking about it.
So I ask myself, is it a mere coincidence, the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right? Or is nature really a inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research, that is, all those sciences that integrate and unify.
(Laughter) The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the human being, I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here I bring you a summary.
(Applause)
I remember, with the scientific consensus, the Earth's planet was formed between 4.500 and 5,000 million years ago.
For example, the biological variety has been increased to great speed, by raising a wide range of multi-sellular organisms, the elderly, with the exclusion of metals, the biological variety has been increased in the first half of this period, and the miracle of life, between 3800 million years.
In fact, it's known that the other libraries have four million years ago, it started the hegemonic period of the mammals, and it didn't be able to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago, the Homo Near dentalis and Homo Sapis, 200,000 years ago, thanks to the possible rests found until now.
(Laughter) Actually, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of human species that cohabits and co-evolution in the planet Earth, along with the rest of its biodiversity richness.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years ago, the human being is adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed, as something unbearable.
A species between species.
In a 30-year-old Parliament, or maybe 100 million species, a single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species, and that's if it's crazy, and we are all responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs, but the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him.
In the midst of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
(Laughter) If it seems we've forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, equating the thermal fusion of stars that can reach the 65 million degrees of degrees, and that's why it was little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological spider we leave in the breast, our mother Earth.
In the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: Since 1990 to the year 2020 we'll predict that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Forum of nature?
If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours, but we don't have four planets, that's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and carbon, has generated a big global warming, and what does this mean, imagine that we close the doors and the windows in which you are sitting?
PK: Yes, imagine it.
You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
Darwin told us that only survives the strongest, the ones who adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
If it's true that there is violence and predation and excess in all forms, in life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competition, but cooperation, I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach an egg to fertilize it.
What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
For example, soccer, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it.
Our body is a pluricerular organism where millions of cells cooperate the best model to imitate and perfect, to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is lost in time, it has suffered from linear thinking.
That it's not adapted to this socioeconomic system that is located patologically, a study of Oxford last year said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99 percent; that's socialism, that also failed, and capitalism has also failed.
The money has colonized life, and that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
And it's something that's inside all of us, we all have that high school, of thousands of years ago, but this is not new, this is already born, and I invite you to play a game.
How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us, imagine, what happened to them with this ship? Well, they occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"?
Well, the Japanese did the train Bala.
And with this "Murcié Lago."
We could make a trunk, right?
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites, we could make bioclimatic buildings.
And with this is Girasol.
A plant of solar boards, as we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Bio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature, many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb so much percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material to the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a president of our children and grandchildren, I would like you to tell me, "Dad, imagine a future dialogue with your children and grandchildren, at least try it, fight!"
PK: And you.
And what would you like to hear?
Thank you.
And I have to tell you that the quarantine has our opportunity and the pandemic is not autonomy, it's horrible, we're going to do everything missing, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, well, we're going bad, socially to our friends.
This is terrible, there's nothing to do the respect, and it's not because we think it's an opportunity to take advantage of and that we're not part of something, if we take advantage of it, and that's a great moment to learn, it's a moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment, we're going to do now.
And what I had to think of, is an idea in which I was meditating from a book.
And what impressed me is that for him, going to take a garden as a person writes, and then he decides when the diagnosis of HIV passes the mouse, not like now that we spend the mouse, cooking, doing pan or oxygen.
Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks you've experienced are those."
And this reproductive work, which is to reproduce new things in the world, we can say, cooking for the work of production, not even the reproductive work, which is a productive work that comes out of sexism, basically, to cook the work for the next day, to take care of it, and that we take a lot of time, already increase, by increasing.
And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is valuable is the subject that makes the original object, that produces the new world in which the subject of care is that the productive work has an economic value, that is something that doesn't make you think is important, these are values that we don't have, because it's unbearable.
Let's think it's the opposite, even if the care tasks are the most important: hundreds of days we're living without advertising, without writers, a lot of things, even without powerpoints, and the world keeps spinning, but the world doesn't go spinning without care.
And without health, the only thing that allows us today is to eat and cure and clean.
So, those tasks don't only have a mechanical value that we have to go through the river, and if not only that, they have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value, and not only that they have to cook, we could do it like that, we thought it for a long time.
But what I also thought is a very strange way of thinking that we have to be careful with our bodies, we think that we have to be careful with nature as tasks that have a wisdom that are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to be able to compensated in what we are.
And that the body will do something we have to overcome.
This new opportunity, and, in fact, I want to go back to my life, now, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write new equals, so it's life, we all live in this contradiction and this life for the absurdity, I give the world, we need more novels, I think, well.
Why not, instead of obsessed with being productive in these days and getting to know all the colds and with all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with the care of others, in another way, from that?
That's why, in fact, when they invited me to do this passive that didn't belong to me, but that's why I thought that writing, bringing something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was, with my books, and that I wanted to tell other people, what to do, take care.
Thank you very much.
People, when they're going to be diet, the first thing they think is what they're not going to eat: no more bread, no more sweet, no more posters.
Pastas, every fifteen days, a end of the middle.
These foods don't fat, what's fat is the dismissive and disordered way we consume them, but that's why I want to name three key aspects to have a good food, the first is consciousness.
(Video) Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness rate is secondary to brain activity."
And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So if the consciousness rate to our desires we would never choose a food we didn't want to eat, but the opposite, the one we don't like the most.
And after this, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating and in what quantity.
KA: A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger.
[A.DE.]
Because when we have a man, it's not a man of a man, it's a man of everything, and it's hungry and heaty.
And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat.
I've always prohibited it, it has been the most tempted.
The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas.
B, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double wealth.
So?
Going back to the subject.
We are really able to say "Pixa", "No, thank you," I prefer a "guardol."
Impossible, right?
Well, the second aspect is practice.
To eat, like every process in life, is learned.
And in this case, and in many cases, I include myself re-aprends.
We must learn to eat in station, what does this mean, to eat the food that have been harassed at that time.
This will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and by making a god in our health.
Because foods are made of their own, of their time.
These are the most natural foods, that is, they are not addicted with calories, they are the richest food in nutrients, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating the same.
The last aspect?
For me, it's not smaller, but it's from the most important ones in moderation.
Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxiety.
And I have a question.
Do you also give them anxieties to repeat the plate of purchasing with frites?
To think, right?
So?
What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates?
Because hunger is not manipulable if they are restricted in food, if they get out of food.
What is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion.
(Laughter) To be the graphicest, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
Every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength.
So, if we don't stop each three, four hours to take a collection?
That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we're going to disappoint all the food around us.
To go over.
Together with this, I want to dismantle the lack of belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose and not.
The most expart body becomes to reserve, to look.
And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body.
The food only makes you fat, we leave in favor of ignorance, the food can hurt you or be cured, it depends on us, of taking awareness, with what we are feeding ourselves and in what quantity?
Well, I return to moderation.
That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation.
That food stimulates overweight.
To give you a closet, I propose to eat everything you like, eat varied, but always take care of the portion.
Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "Almorsa como Prince" and "sena" as I mentioned, I think many of us know it.
The health has excuses: "I can't, I don't have it, I get hungry, or even worse."
Sometimes I died of soup.
We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly, thank you very much.
A while ago I came obsessed by telling stories of scientific women: I love it, the first one that seemed obvious, Marie Curie, didn't give a Nobel Prize, they gave them two, so it deserves his pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize but did incredible things.
Eugenia works actively until 2004, she did big contributions, and they say that it was very copied that you could talk to her, and you know that Ugeneia's story of Ugeneas to Sardote, Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war.
But I found her very little.
How did I lose it, not give you an idea to the bronk that this gave me to have found them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who were done, but, above all, to not lose salt?
(Applause) We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question and the answer are new in our language, they come to bounce back from the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography, a clear and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says that we have to write, according to how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that was never differentiated in its original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with waves and decades.
Three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience, we all went to school.
All of us invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and infantile brain, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions, allowed us in many ways.
However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask this question, the answer is much simpler and less trascendent than what it may believe, ortography is good, or it's good, according to just or not, it's just easy to teach, to learn and use correctly the ortography, in the ortography, we can't dedicate it to other issues of language issues of language that are complexity, if they deserve time and effort.
(Video) What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want.
The language is a common use tool.
And therefore, it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria.
But I also think it's fundamental that those criteria communicate the simplest thing that can be done, especially because if we simplify our ortography, we're not leveling down, when the ortography is implemented, in nothing the quality of language, or savings, agongora, what do I see?
That sometimes they write "men," "sin H," sometimes they write "scribe" with "vecorta" and it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality.
(Laughter) But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive with which teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography.
But the truth is that being the things like they are, that has all the meaning, you can get or stop getting a job as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the culprit's culprit, the educational bubble of public bubble, for a crazy bird, then, in that context, of dedicating all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers or linked to the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed ortography, sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that, effectively, had the place in Spanish language, the one of Chile, mediated.
In the 19th century.
Why not take the bet on those teachers and start?
I wanted to move forward in our ortography, me here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I wanted to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing.
We eliminate Hémuda, where we wrote an H.
(Laughter) But we don't pronounce anything, we don't write anything, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify for someone.
All the fats that cause HMUDA, Bélarga and Becorta said before: "Never distinguish themselves in the Spanish language, we choose one, it can be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument, we don't with one, we eliminate the other."
Jalabe, giraffe, people, Argentine.
I know.
And Eze, Iceta, is an interesting case.
(Laughter) Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended; I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two, and from three letters, we go to two.
We are all better.
Some of these changes may seem a little dramatic.
Well, they are not that much.
The Spanish Academy is linked to the stories, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that appeals to history, traditions and customs are transformed into an obstacle for today's use.
And that explains, in fact.
That our language is much more.
It's the ones we know, that we have geographically close.
We were historically modifying ourselves, for example.
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol.
And little by little, now they start to remove themselves exhausely some moved haches in the dictionary of the academy: harp, harmony, they can write with H or Sinache.
And we're all fine.
It also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion.
It always tells us that language changes spontaneously from below to above, which are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications, and that authority, in some places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
In other words, a long time later, they accept them and incorporate them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of success, for the level of words, it's less true for the grammatic level, and almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above.
They were always the institutions that fixed the norms and proposed modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use than speech?
But at our time, the time of social networks is suffering a revolutionary change.
(Laughter) It never described as much as now, they never wrote so much to the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school, novelous ortographic uses, where even unpected ortography people, when they write in social networks.
It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication for now.
There are chaotic, individual uses, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that follows writing, a new place, is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do badly to reject them.
To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinable norm with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we want to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be able to learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with a simplified ortography, we will stop distinguising between these words that are different in just one lyrics, that is true, but it's not a problem.
Our language has ormonies, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit money, the suit that we put ourselves from the situations, the context dissipates any confusion.
(Laughter) But there's a third objection.
And for me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one they say.
But I don't want to change.
I educate myself like this, I get used in this way when I read a written word in simplified ortography: "My eyes hurt."
That objection is within each one of us.
What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used and wait for time to feel?
There are the new norms.
The success of all ortographic reform that touches so arraigated habits.
This is in the prudence, consensus, gradualism and tolerance, but we can't let the damage to old customs take us forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive.
So I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography.
All those habits we use because we receive them, even if they don't serve us, I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest environment, but important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future.
Thank you very much for my father to die, I remember looking at him in the eyes.
I had the eyes coffee with a peaceful achievement around the IRIS, and saying to myself, "Don't blame your eyes."
After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope.
For surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images.
(Laughter) The discovery I made transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe inside my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space, an exciting space, without body.
It was absolute content, it became a father.
This image.
Let's see it.
And that's the image of my microscope father's seeds.
And this other is the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection from anything or nobody.
His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence we are scared by the cosmos.
And that when we look at the mirror, there are perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe.
And that matter is not created nor destroyed.
It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle.
In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
And their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating.
B.G: We shouldn't create an IBAP from education.
Imagine a public agency that designs content and strategies to transform learning.
I worked with schools to rewrite what classrooms happen, which develops the research of borders to use, for example, artificial intelligence in the education of large scale.
AC: A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logic of the short term, the maximum specialists should reach and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management: the first step.
It's thinking about the state as a possibility.
It's not like the variable of all the adjusts.
Just like that, changes in education will not benefit from the most advantages.
(Applause) I'm not a scientist, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations, from great lovers, to pandemics.
And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves the most ridiculous and the most worldwide, for example, the world obsession would buy mountains of hygiene.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous has an unconscious logic.
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer, it's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to humans to try to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, thinking that, in fact, we won't do anything, and this would have given us a great amount of time to the rest of us, not only had found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public, and many other parts of the world, lost a great opportunity of today.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or doctors, but that are more moral or social, and, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up in guilt or stigmas, for example, in the vast bubble, it accused to the judges in Europe, and to the Chinese in San Francisco, with the United States, but they are more moral or more social ones that really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the most expensive are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already in a healthy farm or contagious, and this is very important, but there's another more important reason, that is that if they only use more squares, they know who is sick and who they don't use no longer.
That they use it in the whole world is a way of avoiding the stigma, and with this, of taking care of everyone.
Perhaps, what we've discovered in our traditions, in our habits, in our days, is our extraordinary capacity for change, this is a discovery now, for years we think that education can't change and that it was extremely difficult to change it, and, however, in three days, now all kids educate in their house.
We don't know even about the consequences of this. We've learned that we are willing to do the award need, and the world keeps moving.
Also, of course, they change our values, our judgment, towards only two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a small mental experiment: it's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future?
Imagine the next situation.
Imagine that with this we really activate the effect of epidemic, we don't disappear completely, but we die a lot less people, and we can use this information to know who is infected or who is at risk of getting infected, and who is not at risk, our temperature, our face, and who we are, where we are, where we are, where the economy and the world of the way we see it.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk that they were a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic, could you choose if it looks good or bad to do this?
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention that is there, between one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pillar in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social impact, maybe and everyone.
A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case sexual freedom, we found a good solution of commitment.
Sex-compreservative: when all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free and careful at the same time?
Are you going to fly less in a sky?
Would we change the way to greet ourselves? Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want the preservative sex of the coronavir.
My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It was a animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it "dolars of sea," are relatives from the sea's erices, and they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for 15 million years.
At that moment, I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea dollar broke down, the sand fell.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way, but I was interested in the fossil or fascination by these past beings, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They continued captivating me and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
And I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a quantity that paleontologists mentioned daily, but which is very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people: 10,000 by 10,000, those are 100 million, that's a amount that doesn't enter the head.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us in our heads.
But well, the life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I've traveled for deserts and fossil studies of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it has also led me.
A very special place, which is Patagone.
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally, we think of these landscapes of forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes, but for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
We know, fortunately, 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of the Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the northern hemisphere, the dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex, and this difference between the northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the healing hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet, for the first time they reached giant size for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the living niches of carnivores of omnivores in the whole planet.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic.
And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in Cerros like this, walking a lot of heat afternoon.
And after walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks on the floor, and I approached the idea that I was approaching, it was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the trick of a dinosaur.
I got closer, stood next to me, stood up, really.
I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what was the track of a carnivor dinosaur.
But I couldn't really believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life.
Then, despite the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was already over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
(End of video) Until the next time given to the winter.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found, or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day of the expedition, of course, the animal was dead, and it was discovered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way its entire exkeleton of this dinosaur.
And then the excavation begins: reading, staying, cap, those sediments that were shaking, where it would open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's for the first time, going back to the surface, an animal that lived in that same place for 60 million years.
The Germal had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, that they kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediment caps, and in that same process, bones turned into fossil fuels for chemical reactions.
Then all that package of hidden rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming of all this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover.
The layer I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills, looking for those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun, the Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to take all these protected remains to the lab: in the museum, the museum begins with an infinite patience, they are removing grain to grain.
All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's when we saw that this family had been originated 100 million years before what we thought: much before the South hemisphere and the North hemisphere separated in being lived by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we do in the lab, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
The challenge was quite complete and told with a very well preserved and with some very strange teeth, in a way of hand, and that's why we call this "man and Dance."
Now, this dinosaur is very particular, in addition to something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, which is a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or is that it wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end to the end of the school.
And this dinosaur mining didn't look like in anything to the forms we found or knew about the North hemisphere, studying its rest we could see that its closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in Atlantic Ocean, which separates these two continents, but, again, we had a case of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and that they had nothing to do with the North hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern.
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived in this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time.
Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big black circle, it was a great desert what was isolated to this fauna making the evolution in an independent way and completely separated from the fauna's fauna's fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we found fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really found fantastic, fascinating things: they have challenged the limits of what the body size in life's history have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It's that they take us to understand chapters like this, the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming.
The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years.
That in millions of pages yet by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today is fundamental to know their story.
Because knowing the past is key to understand the present.
It's also key.
To design a future.
Many of us.
So, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies, I dreamed of competing and containing magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible and invasive territories.
That's it.
After that time, all my life I dedicated myself to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work, through the subtle, they give us a bathroom of reality, they are not my imagination, but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers, which is the most important in this situation that has to live, which is the superpower of thinking better.
Obviously, there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
What I'm going to tell you are my ideas, I learned them from others.
And this is, maybe, the main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you, that we are able to learn and that our ability to think is not given or is fixed, but that it can be developed.
Poting our mind with powerful and practicing ideas.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine they enter a gym, look at those in the floor, parents, bicycles, daughters, they go around.
They go to the bar, they have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they get married.
It doesn't work like that, our body doesn't improve with this.
Well, compensating happens the same, it doesn't count being able to think, because it counts to think.
We have to practice, think, developing in us the habit of thinking is something that is used and give time to think, it's something we use or we use.
It's the second.
It says the saying that when you only see a mark, you see all the problems as a keyboard.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
And not to realize their keyboard.
If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing, and if we need to cut something, we need a bear.
To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems, and if we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get a two nest with a noise, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where these mental models are found, in mental models, in ancient Egypt, 3,000 years before Cristo, in the Middle Ages and in our time, for example, mental models, in different places and in different times.
To think better we have to expand the box of tools of our heads, but all the problems will seem to be linked.
It's the third.
Little by little, I was in the club and in the table next to her son and his classmates who had told him about the soccer teacher of his son a man who told his friends for a mistake that teacher had committed.
Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher.
But it didn't realize what.
In other words, this was generating a much greater evil.
In his child.
I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends and I was disturbing the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that being focused on winning in a scale makes us have success in that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other most important scale.
To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example, money and freedom, or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act.
The fourth.
The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impressions make us emotions, for example, now in the pandemic, many data came from China's situation.
But those acts didn't have impressions, they generated emotions, and they did not act.
When they started to reach Italy images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These impressions generate emotion, fear, and the fear of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what is moving.
This time we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone seemed to us before.
But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric.
To get married is something: you have hunger, you have an immediate compassion, you eat what you get married, but cultivating is very different, you make the effort now for something you're going to take inside six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have, but to come to generate applause, because it's avoiding something nobody is well-being, but saves lives.
We develop our ability to act before feeling, that is to develop our ability to anticipate, it's one of the main skills of thinking well.
What do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we live?
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations; if something bad lasts three months, if we think we would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
At 49 we are exhausted, if we program to run 20 to kilometers, we are unbearable.
We make a story of resilience, but the key of resilience is to handle expectations well.
But sex is ultimately.
Have you ever happened that you met a well-known place, you're walking through a town in the middle of the NASA, a high school classmate that wouldn't happen 15 years ago, you can't create the unlikely chance to find it in that place?
It's true, finding that classmate in that place is something totally improbable, but, in fact, it's very likely to find someone in a very improbable place, it happens to us all the time.
Well, with the rest of the life is the same: there are so many unlikely things that happen very likely to us.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis that little of the future, we don't know what will happen.
Neither now my field with more normal times, we have to learn to live with the uncertainty.
And the best intelligent way to live with uncertainty is to always leave many open doors.
Not to think only about the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible for serious things, even if someone ever asks you, why do you always have cars with the highest level?
Testal: you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world, that because once, with a secondary classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years.
That is to say, the beginning that the idea of this talk is surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn and learn has to do with being accepted.
To the fact of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking and people with which to grow these ideas, to be able to enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others, it's about changing our own ideas, an interview for 40 years, the interview Domis is a question, and when Borges replied.
He asked for excuses, he didn't have much time to think about these four years ago, Borges stayed quiet and said: "Look at this same question for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live to be accepted by new ideas that are emerging and be always open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you.
Women are irrational beings, always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodia of a man, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives.
They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for the education of girls and young girls about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times.
In 1915, no country in the world, women could vote, in 2015, that is, in 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women, in 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But the French science Academy said that he didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of those who are here had already finished the primary.
Because university, leaving, has a very prestigious business school.
That's been celebrating this in 1925, until now 50 years ago, a woman could be a master's degree.
The University of Yale admired women in 1972.
The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow.
But this was this idea.
Because women only serve to create children and help their husband, which is a rational, aesthetic series.
It was a truth made a century ago, they believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment, and almost all, taking 5,000, maybe, believed that this idea was a truth made.
Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions that we've lived in, if the truth is true, there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
That is to say, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
Two 500 years ago, Pindar said this in a poem, now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we can understand it once.
When you say that there is no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
In other words, interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretative mark, what day is today 24th September?
Does anyone doubt it?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, let's convince that it's the 24th of September, because everything we're here is part of a very arduous social construction that we've automatized and naturalized, cats live without a calendar.
My dog applies to the chest and who's very lonely at home.
(Laughter) "No, doing some misfortune."
I didn't know the time, I knew what I had become.
But don't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world?
What would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at an apple, it was written the law of gravity, which is genius, but that's how ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels he did, to know the animals he saw, all he had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides...
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea, but if it's born, the scientific movements, the technological innovation, that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that the same happens with quantum mechanics and the same politicians and social changes were born in the 19th century.
And, however, in less than 100 years, the half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost for humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels.
How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
In other words, errones are monsters.
There's an idea we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half and that example to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality, up to 1860 there were no homosexuals in the world.
You will say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, the relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere, that occur to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, at all times."
They were even documented in many species outside the human being, but they had never thought that sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally created.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A.
Moreover Victorian, who was one of the great forms of social control during a centuries and peak, stronger than existed, because the same thing to turn the catolic church into something we want to do doesn't have turbies.
You'll do it with guilt, that is, you'll do it, but it's going to give you guilt.
(Laughter) Culture is a great social control, huh?
(Applause) You don't wish the woman of your fellow man.
(Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it.
And then, that is a form of terrible social control because it dominates us, probably, on the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they were able to eat us.
And we can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, censorship, the waste was created where everything that was wrong, the society of the sexual point of view, put it there.
And homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, my right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks, who were unhappy, and we talk when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jewish, and none of the situations today is ideal.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be frightened, but there's a drama of social fights, and it's that one has to get into the prison that discriminated me.
I have to be just Jewish, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a Jewish, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, to eat the black, only black, and the same only gay, but, however, we have to take that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
50 years ago.
Look how old I was, I was a homosexual boy, I didn't know what a homosexual child was, and I didn't know the homosexual word either, and my colleagues told me, "I agree, we're going to hit you."
"Thank you, don't look at me."
And I didn't know what it was, nor gordopute, nor homosexual, nor anything, and at the same time I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that my father loved me, looked at me.
And I started to feel what would I have done so that it come out like that.
What was it like?
I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there was a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, to do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person, like any other person in the world.
Yes, contradictory, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn that I'm also a person, I say I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close the 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had to understand that there are no facts that exist.
Audience: Yes.
(Applause)
(Laughter) Interpretations.
(Applause) There are the contradictions and it's going to say, because in fact that, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend me, and now I want to leave my prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful.
Do you think jail is?
That's it, or they told me, "The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, and if I had the things we need to survive, it's a long or small moment, that there's a list of things we need to survive: to adapt, but explore is something different, to live constantly with this channel, every moment and everything that knows disappears.
Every moment, it's a combination of energy, but once you say it, each of these ideas looks like a bomb, you look for exterminating, once you do it, every time you do it, you pay for the voices of someone else, and you have to choose, you open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side, and in part with each one of them.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated: a class is not bad, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, and that when life builds the music, the movements, I believe it, with a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing.
Moments that keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be a work of art, but will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
That voice, your best friend, will always be the first one to defend you, the first to give you a little look to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla, that day list to jump for you when you need it, that person is your best friend.
A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without that a mechanism, I can't survive.
(Laughter) What we created in girls' cities.
I'm sure we've ever said it.
(Laughter) I don't have the opportunity to get out of it, I have no idea to do it, I can't go through the way I would like it.
(Laughter) Do you remember that all the time tired was better?
Is this really like that?
To think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of all life, and Juancho, Ranco and Manuel, we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us in these photos that are seeing there.
That I can tell you about my friends that I really want, who are like my brothers, who stay here in the city and go to the surprise, to the day of today, can't get a job that allows them to get their dreams.
While I am in this picture, the lack of opportunities is also present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort on humans so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I didn't even know that if I stayed here in the city...
I could study the other, but probably the future as a person is quite opportunities.
Have you ever wondered why these things happen?
We live in full 21st century, we are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, where successes and advances are with a speed that surprise us all and deprives the borders and the barriers that insisted between people.
And in this context?
And cities, to make more and more important cities, are our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2058% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would have to be almost 10 people around the world.
Seven out of every day.
If there are more people, they choose to live in cities, they want to say that I have the greatest chance to progress.
What do you explain, then, that while the closet cities look like in time, other progress, vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them?
I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to go to the cow when you get out of that door to return home, this is strategy.
If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world.
It makes us feel our strength, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world has to achieve, not in an indiscriminate way, but in the field of international relationships, with the opportunities that the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Through concrete projects, now you can see how all this is beautiful that I'm telling you in real life, and avoid migration to other places in search of a better future.
Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends.
In the second place, as I said, it's a sort of hyper-proportional relationships that we have with each other, some of us have a couple of threads, but, in the second place, some of them are going to decorate the quality of the strength of the phones, what we're going to improve, the lack of the lack of opportunities.
Franco, for example, is the one that is also made in these photos.
It was the national championship of geography in 2002, national champion.
(Laughter) But today, although it's left to publish a school teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be some students working to be able to live.
I like to go to the subway, how much I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the strength of security in the country, but, as I didn't count with that possibility here, then I started to find what's really passionate about, which is what's my left below.
It's going to college to study programming, and it can't develop its potential and keep learning what you like, because it's not a genius that illustrates, but it doesn't know the geniuses, it takes any thing, but it depends on the lack of presupport to biodiversity.
Time studies programming, and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you is that we, as young people, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world.
Stop.
Recently, I had the huge fortune of being elected between a group of 8 young people, at a worldwide level, I left the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinean, that event, to participate in a week in New Day and the capital of India.
Audience: No.
Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back.
I learned a lot, but if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following.
First, there are millions of people who have a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them the opportunities outside, but not less important, they can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there, for all the tastes and for all the values.
But again, we want better cities, we know strategically in the world.
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could study, I remember, I was a bit scared, with a lot of time.
This can never be found in public because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city, to play, it's like leaving a piece of your heart, until today I feel like that, almost six years went by.
For this, don't go to you, and to your friends, or to anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our young people, so they stay in their cities and grow from there.
In the end, what's more beautiful than giving wings to the city you had to do.
And with a strategy, what can we do?
Imagine the brilliant who would have been white.
(Laughter) If I could dedicate myself completely to geography.
Or how much, if today they were in one of the security courses in our country?
Or to not go so far away, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I like.
Is it like that?
That's how it's been raised by opportunities.
For you, all this.
That I'm telling you that it doesn't seem enough argument and it wants a more example.
"Look."
I don't fear well.
This is the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I was able to overcome the profound decrease of mine in which I fell because I had to go to the edition.
After two suicide methods.
In numeral, psychological schools that cost me a lot, a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop passing, we have to go out strategically.
Please, we don't take a final point in our city.
AC: Thank you very much.
I'm a surgeon.
Well, from always the surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in my last 10 years.
I have my research.
In my case in the zoo, the reasons were based on looking for more and less patients.
That can be done in several ways, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair for themselves, using their own ability to regenerate, this is what we do with biological platforms that are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own ability to restore after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before we had to operate and take them out.
KA: Robotics are giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks.
What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating.
To challenge my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfactions, me and a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized that developing goals, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work.
I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor, my mother is a Japanese, literary, sociological, and anthropological of Japanese culture.
And I think that certain behaviors and answers, social and individuals of the Japanese society, can help us when facing a crisis like this one.
It's worth asking us a first question.
Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage if in January it was the first case?
I was almost 130 million in very reduced space, being so close to the neighbour.
Speaking of the populations of the third age, older people in the world.
Being in the second country with more fumers for many inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
And theified, but a linear advance, until now.
Basically, we know that this new coronavirus is very contagious: many people, in a little place, and a fourth of those people, in these demographic status, Japan introduces us to a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society educated in such a way that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it.
Japan went through wars, Tifones, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 temblors per day.
Generation between generation has had to overcome natural disasters caused by men.
This is what we can think with something that likes the Argentines a lot: football teams, like example.
What football team will make better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do.
Or the team that has never trained, that has no infrastructure, and that has to go out to improvise.
The directives of social distancing, hygiene and individual behavior.
Be in society or in your own house.
The Japanese population hasn't established for hundreds of years, it doesn't have to embrace, not give beers, because they don't do it.
(Audience raises hands) He greets with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most workers in public places use a lot.
In fact, Asian studies show that more than 50% of Japanese don't need to recommend to take out the shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used, we don't have to indicate, it's not to sleep or to feel frightened.
Not to protect yourself, but to protect others.
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good of everything is more important than the good of a part.
(Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
I will surely know the game of the chair.
They put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and they get rid of each round.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all following the place to a classmate.
Because it gives shame to win one when another suffers.
The word "how" expresses this way of being, it's about having the trust that the other will take care of me, in resonance with feeling that we realize when we take care of others.
In the example, there are children, but we can already see how a collective society works, it helps itself, because each invisible contributes to the good of all.
