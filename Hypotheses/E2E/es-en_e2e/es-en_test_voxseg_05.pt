Not for their children and for their grandchildren.
I need you to help us.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
Let's learn.
To feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lombocan Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
It's with that feeling of unbelievable.
It's surrounded by a great biodiversity.
of tortugas, of recipes, of corals, of mold fish.
And fish from all colors.
I had a feeling of being connected with nature.
It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed a small fish.
And blacks and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
And that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right?
So it's the same thing my students think about the university, every time I tell it.
They look at each other.
And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy.
But I'm not crazy.
And for that, I bring a scientific test.
But from the globe fish, which is an artist.
24-year-old work.
For a second.
For you.
That artwork we're going to do.
Or the opposite?
The maritime stream would take it.
That mandate we see.
It shows you that nature has consciousness.
That's why I'm not crazy.
And if I'm able to talk to others.
It will be true that indigenous peoples originate.
You can talk to others.
With rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena.
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific tests, last year the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems were analyzed.
Scientists?
They said.
There is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between companies and predators.
In other words, for every four bottles, there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
I'm paradoxically deformed to this same mathematical pattern.
It is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology.
I agree with the law of Clayber.
A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse.
But three, four.
And if they stop thinking about it.
And what do we live in?
It's made of three quarters of water.
That's it.
So I ask myself.
Is it a merac coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study.
It's the great story of my PhD research.
That is to say, all those sciences.
What integrates unifies them?
So the history of the universe, the Earth's planet, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategy.
That we must imitate and perfect.
To achieve a sustainable development.
And here I bring you a summary.
I agree with my intense consensus.
It's like the explosion of the Big Bang.
The universe came up to 13,700 billions of years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.500.
20 million euros.
And the agriculture of life.
It was between 13, 1800.
Three,500 million years.
During the first life of this.
Well, the forms of primogenite life of the Earth kept very simple levels of complicity.
The appearance of oxygen frees the atmosphere.
Well, the first complex cells were originated.
That's the danger.
With the Cambrical exclusion of the metaphor, the biological variety has been increased to great speed.
by creating a wide, organisms, cell phones.
Because it's developing survival strategies.
It's a very simple energy.
Like, for example.
DB: The kitchen.
The following thing seems to indicate that life appeared and the depths of the oceans.
It wasn't able to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago.
With the disappearance of the dinosaurs of the curious period.
66 million years ago the hegemonic period of the mammals started from where one afternoon came from.
The first or small pipes.
Thanks to fossil remains found until a fact that other libraries have four million years.
The homosexuals are the two million, the near dental men and Homo Sapis, 200,000.
(Laughter) Actually, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of human species.
The ecosystem and co-evolution in the planet Earth.
Together to the rest of his Diodivers Rica.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants a few 10,000 years ago, and especially from the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago.
Human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendent way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed.
It was like something unusual.
It's in three.
In a 30-year-old Parliament, maybe.
100 million species.
It's a single species.
A humanitarian?
It's destroying.
The processes of co-volution of the rest of the species.
And that's how it is.
And we are all responsible.
Because life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve everything.
But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him.
In this half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And it seems that we have forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of stars that can reach 65 million degrees.
And that's why it was little.
But future generations are also threatened.
Because of the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth.
In the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of Earth.
Well, from 1990.
Until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Forum of nature?
All of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
In addition.
The use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming.
And what does this mean?
Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater, and we take fire to the bottles you are sitting in.
Yes, imagine.
You already know the barbari, right?
Well, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
A chronic scenario of natural resources.
They won't be able to develop in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate.
So Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones who better adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
If it's true, there is violence and predation and excess, in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but cooperation, I give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Crossing, fighting, competing to reach a novel, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not that competition, but the inviotic union has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
Well, soccer, for example.
So we all know that a team competes against another.
But what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it.
Our body?
This is a plural cellular organism.
Where millions of cells cooperate to do what we do.
Paradoxically, nature is the best way to imitate and perfect to achieve sustainable societies.
After 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses time has suffered catástrofes of meteorite ice creations and linear thinking processes.
Political doctrine, like anarchism, that failed the communism that also failed.
Socialism failed and capitalism was also failed.
A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99.
This is yes, it's being crazy.
And that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
It's not adapted to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because it's signed to nature to get economic benefits.
We've sent peace to the outside space and nuclear recipes at the bottom of the sea.
Well, money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
In other words, "bio" life, my mimic, imitation, imitation of life, but this is not new.
This is already been born in original poles, indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and it's something that's inside all of us, we all have that faculty.
And I invite you.
Let's play a game.
Let's see, imagine.
What happens to this vegetable garden?
How could engineers, architects?
The economists, inspired me.
Well, it occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak?
From the "Pajaro Martín Bolador."
Well, the Japanese did the train Bach.
And with this murciano?
We could make a trunk, right?
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could make bioclimatic buildings.
And with this is Girasol.
I have a solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species.
In nature, therefore.
Bio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But we continue.
Think about nature?
It will be there for siempre.
And we have to overcome the cognitive face.
From the GDP.
What does the GDP mean?
Many economists tell us that we have to make, build.
To climb so much percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material.
For the industry.
But we have to be aware of it.
Whereas the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think?
If we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started.
Can you imagine?
Do we future dialoguing?
With their children and grandchildren.
And I would like you to tell me.
Please!
At least you try it.
Audience: Lights.
PK: And you.
What would you like?
And I have to tell you that the quarantena is not forconnected, and they cover me.
They are horrible things.
We're not going to do everything missing.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, mentoring.
We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our family.
This doesn't happen at all, it doesn't matter what to think is an opportunity to take advantage of and that we are not part of something, if we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn, it's a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
I said that.
So life is not about something else, that happens horrible moments and learning from them: we learn pain, disease.
We learn from war, we die of death.
If we do it, if we go to that direction.
Don't worry.
That's what we're going to do now.
And what we have on the Internet?
It's an idea in which I was meditating from a book.
It's called the modern nature, but it's the right to the hormone.
They are the newspapers that Germán arrived in the 80s, when the diagnosis of HIV, and then he decides to return to his childhood to kindergarten, which, in fact, was diagnosed after his diagnosis.
They are a lot of very important movies, some of the most important spaces of their career.
But what he decides is that he will buy a landing in a horrible place and he will take care of a kindergarten.
And it became impressive.
Like a person writes you.
It's that to take care of a garden it wasn't to be time.
It wasn't, well.
Going through the mouse.
Not like now that we spend the mouse cooking, doing pan or oxygen.
Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks you've experienced are those."
And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism.
From Frid Gengers, it's almost mental, and it's more specially the feminist weapon.
To talk about reproductive work, it's not even the productive work, which is the one who put new things in the world, we can say, that is, "I'm a father or a key, it doesn't matter."
And this is a reproductive job that makes the conditions so we can do.
To clean, cook, take care, right?
AC: Thank you very much.
We were able to cook the workers for the next day to put the factories, their reproductive work, and the female took a lot of time.
By increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also there.
But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory.
And I'm going to tell you why the fat of cancer in that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value.
And even more, why don't we do it as an excrement and think that this difference is contrast between productive and reproductive work is a difference?
It's more difficult, given by one side.
Of course, gender, there are areas that are important, these are the productions, traditionally performed by gold.
And reproductive remains.
(Laughter) On the other hand, if you don't interview it, maybe it's not important.
And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that makes the origin, it produces the happiness in the world that the subject takes care of taking care of is something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you artists.
You don't make you think, you don't give you an important thing, right?
And these are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, do you have two days?
We are living without publishing, without writers.
"Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning."
But the world didn't go spinning without me and without care.
Without nurses and no health.
Well, the only thing that has allowed us.
Is it comar?
And to cure.
And he invested.
And what about that, the world?
That's it.
A: Those tasks.
They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
But it's not just something mechanical that we don't have to go through the river.
Whether I didn't exist, pick up one could do that, clean the thing.
cooking, not solving food.
We can think about it, we have thought it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read to Germans is that...
We can also live them in a different way.
Like tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what title is not modern nature, modernity.
Well, the human being separated from the natural world.
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
Without the care relationship with nature.
But it's also something interesting.
Well, the lesson of care with our bodies, we think that we have to be careful about our bodies.
I said, "No, there's the gym, you have to cook."
But only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
He looked at me.
And that is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are.
And that the body will do what we have to overcome.
It seems to me...
Isn't it an opportunity?
And, in fact, I want to return to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is.
We all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
Now.
In fact, the world needs more novels.
Well, I thought, well.
Why not?
And instead of obsessed with being productive in these days.
And to know all the colors and with all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the careers, with others, in another way, from that?
That's why, when they invited me to do this passive, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide that the novel and the world didn't need to bring.
But that's why I thought, we were going to write it.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already taking care of.
That I had with my books and I wanted to tell other people, right?
But what?
I wrote it, right?
And what to do?
Thank you.
People, when they go to a diet, the first thing they think is what they don't go.
It's not bread.
I have more dulces, no more posters.
Every fifteen days.
Have you happened?
A end of the middle.
But food is not fat.
KA: What's fat is the dismissioned and disordered way to consume them.
I think I want to name them.
Three key aspects.
And to have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
(Video) Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness rate is secondary to the brain activity."
And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious.
Our wishes, our beliefs.
So, if consciousness is secondary?
That's it.
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
But on the contrary, the one that doesn't judge the most.
And what about this?
We are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating.
And in what quantity?
KA: A good fact is not to go to the super with love.
Because when we have hunger, there's no blood of apple.
The blood of everything, the vorasiest and the most caloric.
And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat.
I've always prohibited it.
And it has been the most attempt, right?
The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pieces.
B, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double weight.
So that's it.
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
In other words, Pix.
Thank you very much, I prefer a store.
Impossible, right?
Second.
How? How?
It's like every process in life.
It's learned.
And in this case, there are many cases.
That my include is reappeared.
So we must learn to eat in station.
What does this mean?
Let's eat the food that have been harassed at that time.
PK: This is going to guarantee us, a control.
And a balance, our weight, and putting a god in our health.
Because foods are made of their own, of their time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest foods in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not additioned with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or is it normal to see tomatoes in winter and green?
So this mechanism has led to practice.
What will happen to us?
Well, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating mine.
The last aspect?
For me, it's one.
Well, it's not less, but it's from the most important ones in moderation.
To those who don't let go.
Because they don't have hunger, they don't have time, because many of them give them anxiety.
And I have a question.
PK: Also.
And they give them anxieties.
Repeting the plate of purchasing conflicts.
To think, right?
AD: So.
What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates?
Because hunger is not manipulable.
Yes, they restrict food, if they get out of food.
What is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion.
To be more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
Every time with more size, every time with more volume.
And every time with more strength.
So, if we don't stop.
Every three.
Four hours.
A: To take a collapse.
That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we're going to disappoint all the food around us.
To go over.
Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating.
The more sheets I'm going to be, the fish I'm going to lose, and no.
The most expart body becomes to reserve.
I said, "Take a look."
And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our bodies.
But food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave, please, of ignorance.
The food can hurt you or cure you.
It depends on us, of taking awareness, about what we are feeding and in what amount.
That's it, I go back.
And that's the moderation.
That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation.
It should exist a coma with moderation.
That food stimulates overview.
To give it a closet.
I propose you to eat rich.
I'm going to eat everything you like.
Being a varied, but always taking care of the portion.
(Audience) Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desajuna como rey."
And she dies as a prince and scenes as I mentioned.
I think many of us know it.
And the health doesn't have school.
Ah, I can't, I don't have it.
That's it.
And the worst happened to me.
Sometimes I died of it.
We have four opportunities a day.
To choose how to take care of and feed healthy.
How am I obsessed?
I'm telling stories of scientific women.
So I love it: the first one that seemed obvious, Marie Curie.
They gave them a Nobel Prize, they were two.
"What do you deserve your pedestal?"
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize.
But they did incredible things.
Well, I'll find out the story.
From Ugeneas to be a doctor.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war.
He made great contributions.
Among them, the most important thing was the one that brought the vaccine salt.
It against polio in the 50s, thanks to her.
They saved thousands of lives.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eogenea works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to them.
And do you know what?
It died in 2011, I was 111 years old.
I entered her very little.
How did I lose it?
They didn't give us an idea to the bronca that that gave me, to have found them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women.
To honor those who went.
But above all.
Let's stop!
For a long time in school, I learned ortography.
What about the kids?
They keep losing a lot of time in school.
With ortography.
That's why.
I want to share with you a question.
"Aita."
A new ortography.
And I think so.
What do you need or better?
And I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question and the answer are new in our language.
They come by bouncing it from the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Castellan language.
Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to describe how we pronounce.
And to pronounce how we write.
Each sound should correspond to a lyrics.
Each letter should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound.
They had to eliminate themselves.
The criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write.
Second, let's pronounce.
It's and it's not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It's because Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, has always had a strong resistance to writing too different.
So, how do we pronounce?
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that I wanted.
And it was a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological, the one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with dead acts we write, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with long and short waves that, unlike what many people believe, have never been differentiated in the prison pronouncement.
That's how we created Conges.
And sometimes they sound aspers, like in people.
And sometimes they sound soft, like fool, that's how we stay with six, those and seats.
Three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
We all invested large amounts of learning.
Great quantities of that time of plastic and child brain, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions.
They brought us in many simplic and explicit ways.
And the idea that in ortography something was fundamental was played.
It's one of our training.
However, I have the feeling.
And since teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes.
Ortography is used to uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it.
But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example, in ortography there is no individual, involved ability.
In punctuation.
With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase, with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm.
What I'm writing with ortography, no.
Or with ortography, or is it good or bad?
According to Juste or not to the smart norms.
But then, wouldn't it be more senses to simplify the old norms?
Would it be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly?
Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms?
To give all that time to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort.
That's not it.
"Go to Bolivia."
ortography, it's not.
And each one.
It doesn't write how it was.
The language is a tool.
Therefore, it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria.
But it also happens to me.
Fundamentally.
Those criteria, how do they be?
Complete.
What can it do?
It's true.
What is our ortography?
Let's level it down.
When ortography is simplified?
That's not what it feels.
Nothing!
It was the quality of language.
I'm talking about the days with the literature to say it about Ololego, Garcillazo, Servantes, Agongora, what do I see?
What do they write?
AC: Yes, I was born.
Or, sometimes, they write, write with a decoration.
It was absolutely clear to me.
What's the difference between that?
These, and ours?
It's of convention.
Or is it still lack of convention in their time?
Well, but not of quality.
The bad guys!
A key in this story.
I mentioned making mistakes.
Is that insistence a little irreflexive?
With teachers knocking us and knocking us with ortography.
It's true.
This makes sense.
It's our society.
What does it work?
It's a privilege that allows us to distinguish the culte of the brutal.
The education of the ignorant.
Independent.
What's the content?
That's not what you're writing.
Well, you can get or stop getting a job for a H, that I put or left behind.
You can become a bubble object.
Let's see.
Malcolologist.
But then, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we don't have to forget.
Because throughout the history of our language.
It's always more.
Or linked individuals with the lesson of the first letters.
Those who pushed ortographic reforms.
Those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example.
Sanitation, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had the place.
In Spanish language, which was Chile's.
It's mediated.
In the 19th century.
Why then?
Of those teachers?
To move forward in our ortography.
Or in the intimacy of us 10,000?
I wanted to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate the female.
That's it.
That's where we wrote an H.
Well, no!
We don't know anything.
That's it.
What kind of mental attach?
Right?
All fathers?
That causes us.
Let's go.
Velarga and B Corta, we said.
And they never distinguished themselves in the Castellar language.
Let's choose one.
It can be anybody, we can discuss.
To sit down, each one will have their preferences.
Not to be able to argument.
What do we see?
Let's eliminate the other.
What an idiot!
Let's forget the functions, that the ice stays the Sweden sound.
Gattoos, magician, Aguila.
That the jump retains the sound "asperó."
Jarabe.
Girafa, people.
It's Argentine.
What is it?
That's it.
It's an interesting case.
Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide.
But it can't be.
It's an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement.
So they have to be careful.
Now I said, "That is Iceta."
In some places, they correspond to a sound, in other two, and from three letters, we go to two.
We are all better.
Some of them?
And these changes can seem a little dramatic.
But they are not that much.
And the real Academy Spanish.
All the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified.
That language.
It's connected to history, traditions, customs, but also.
It's a practical tool of daily use and that sometimes I attach to history.
To traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
And for the use.
From today.
That's it.
It doesn't explain, in fact.
That's why our language is much more.
What do we know?
What do we have geographically?
We were historically modifying ourselves, for example.
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater.
We went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbols.
And little by little, now.
They start to get rid of some dead Hs in the dictionary of the academic Real.
Armony can be written with H.
Or without HIV.
And we're all fine.
And it seems to me, in addition.
That this is a moment.
Specially appropriated to face this discussion.
It always tells us...
That language changes.
And it's spontaneously below, up.
They are the users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
And that authority, in some places.
A academic, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
A lot of time later, they accept them and incorporate them.
But only for some levels of language, it's true for the text level for the word level.
It's less than that.
For the gramatic level.
Almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always changed historically.
From above to down.
They were always the institutions that fixed the norms.
And they proposed modification.
Why do I say that this is particularly appropriate moment?
"Today!"
What is writing?
I've always had a much more restricted and private use than speech.
But at our time.
The time of social networks.
And that is suffering a revolutionary change.
And he never wrote as much as now.
I said, "There are never so many.
They wrote so much to the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time.
We're seeing a large scale.
There were novelous ortographic uses.
Where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks.
It behaves quite similar to how it is behaved.
The majority of the users of social networks is to say.
Isn't it?
The ortographic correction and priorizes.
That's the speed and effectiveness in communication.
Now, that's it.
There are chaotic help.
Individual.
But I think we have to pay attention.
Because I probably don't know.
I'm not saying that a time signs writing to a new place.
What's happening for that writing?
new criteria.
I don't think it would happen.
To reject them.
It's to discharge them because we identify them.
As symptoms of the cultural decade of our time, I don't think we have to observe it.
To order them and encourage them.
It was inside a more normative.
With the needs of our time.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose.
etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography.
Besides.
What would we want to learn?
Latin, Greek, Arabic.
With a simplified ortography?
Let's go!
And to recover etymology at the same place we are going now.
And also to etymological dictionary.
A second observation of those who say.
If we simplify ortography, let's stop.
To distinguish between six words that make a difference today.
Not only a lyrics.
I don't know.
But it's not a problem.
Is it okay?
Who is anonymous?
Who has words with more than a meaning?
And we don't confuse the bank where we sit on the bank where we deposit money, the suit that we put on things.
Can you imagine?
The cry of situations, the context disturbs.
It was any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
What did I do for me?
Incredible, even.
What's more conmoved, what are the ones who say?
I don't want to change.
So I educate myself.
It's used this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortographies.
They hurt my eyes.
That objection is inside each one of us.
And what do I think we have to do how we always do in these cases?
In other words, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught.
Those who don't want, let us write how we are.
It's not a joke.
I did.
It turns out that time feels.
That's the new norms.
The success of all ortographic renovation.
What a touch!
Arraigated.
The prudence.
The consensus, the degree there.
And tolerance.
But we can't let the reason to old customs either.
That encourages us to move forward.
The best tribute we can do and the past.
It's better.
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree.
And clean from our ortography.
All those habits we use because we receive them.
Although they don't serve us.
Or, "I'm convinced."
What if we do that?
And in the modern field.
It's very important about language.
Let's stop leaving them to the next generations.
Here's a future.
It's better.
Before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes.
I had the eyes of coffee with a joy around the IRIS.
And to say goodbye.
Well, don't forget that zoo.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and love.
Well, maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when they give us hunger.
And I felt the need to look at her seeds at the microscope.
For the surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images.
The discovery I made transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters in my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
It's an excellent space, without body.
It was absolute content.
It became a father.
This image.
Do you know?
And that's the image of my microscope father's seeds.
And it's another one.
It's the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnected from anything or nobody.
His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life.
Let's see the project.
For me, this is teaching.
Well, that our most pure material essence.
Well, we are charged by the cosmos.
And that when we look at the mirror.
There is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe in.
And that matter is not created nor destroyed.
It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodin principle.
In Argentina.
It's imbable.
This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is going on.
Because their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
It's the ability to innovate.
PK: We shouldn't create.
This is an invade of education.
Imagine a public agency.
That designs content and strategies to transform learning.
I worked with schools.
To rewrite what happens in the classroom.
That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
A agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers.
Two teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term.
They should reach the maximum specialists.
And developing a culture.
It's a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
And it's thinking about the state as possible.
Not like the variable of all the trees.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit from masses.
I feel it, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From great desires.
There are extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemic.
Until the fiction made reality.
And here and now, at home.
But we don't stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession could buy mountains of paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Who is an unconscious logic?
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity of belonging.
That's it.
It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to humans to try to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government in only 10 days.
But they hadn't only found the virus that produced the disease, but that they had sequenced their genome and had done it public.
And this would have given a great amount of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology.
It's called optimistic blind.
The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we talk about phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in fact, it won't happen to us.
It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity of currentity.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals.
Why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible, with stigma.
For example, in the Ugonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
Actually, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already inherent contagi to others.
However, Japan has answered that everyone is hot.
This first makes people who are healthy or contagious, it's very important, but there's another most important reason, which is that if they only use more sheets, they know who is sick and who not because they use no more affection.
That they use it all over the world.
It's a way of avoiding the stigma and this.
And to take care of everything.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary capacity for change.
In the end, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do.
And this is what we have discovered now, for years we think that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it.
And, however, in three days, all kids get educated in their case.
But we don't know some consequences of this.
We learned that we are willing to do it in the award need, and the world demands.
Also, of course, our values, our judgment.
It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started.
The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes.
For their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people in their own.
Today, what seemed horrible then.
That everyone has to stay at home doesn't seem completely priority.
And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a little experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the atenderment.
A public consensus that includes the World Health Organization, but also Government and other public sectors has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move, who we find.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our face is viral.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who.
Let's suppose that this consensus can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way.
Those who are at home, those who are not at risk, can go out.
And we continue this mental experiment.
Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of the epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but it dies a lot less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way it is.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons we don't want to see our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them.
Yes, it's still a dream.
PK: Nothing else.
The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic?
And I could choose if it looks good or bad to do it.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is.
Among the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pilling in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
Who knows?
Let's see our data a little like vaccinating us.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact.
To take care of us.
And to everything.
A while ago.
With the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case sexual freedom, we find a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to get to feel free?
And be careful.
Are you going to fly less in a sky?
Would we change the way we greet?
Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know.
DB: But locked up at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think freely than ever?
What do we want, which is the compreservative sex of the heart?
Do you have a meeting with a fossil?
It was when I was 12.
Let's go on a trip.
We did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It's an animal that had lived millions of years ago.
And that, probably, nobody had seen it.
The animal I found was similar to this, as we call it a mind.
They are dollars in the sea.
They are relatives from other people's erices.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment...
I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
The dollar of Mar fell down, the sand fell down.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way.
PK: But...
I'm not interested in fossil or fascination.
So these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
And they kept captivating me.
And they took me.
We started studying dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet.
That's been approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one today: it was so different that not only humans didn't exist.
If not, what?
The whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a quantity that paleontologists do.
We mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you.
It represents a stadium like this of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a number.
That it doesn't enter the street.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life.
A amount of time is really very...
It's very difficult for us.
BB: In your head.
But well.
Life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I've already traveled.
Well, deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but...
It has also led me.
A very special place.
What is Patagon?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally, we think of these landscapes, of forests, of lakes, close to the crop of the Andes.
But for us.
Parentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossil fuels.
What do they want to be discovered?
We know, fortunately, many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world.
Or to look for dinosaurs.
And the great majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia.
They are the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth.
What we call critical period.
This is approximately 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the south hemisphere.
And the dominant carnivores, the most common channels, belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While, at that time, in the northern hemisphere.
They added other carnivores' families, like the dinosaurs, for example.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of the South wasn't surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the South hemisphere of the North hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before?
At that time, all the continents were united in a great super continent called Pangete.
And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the classic.
It's in the southern hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet.
Her key smoke, especially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time dominated the planet completely.
For the first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores, of omnivores in everything.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, studying.
Happy and scholarships.
Exploring.
Or the rocks of Patagonia's curasic.
And that leads me.
One of the stories.
Well, in the discoveries we were able to do.
It's the last blood.
And we found it four years ago.
In Cerros like this, walking.
One afternoon, of a lot of heat.
And after walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks, on the floor.
And I approached the idea that I was approaching.
It was becoming more clearly.
What it was.
It was the traffic of a dinosaur.
And I got closer.
When I stopped next to me, I stood up.
And I was really ice cream.
I asked myself what it was and I knew it was.
I've been studying for years.
There were no bones, anatomy, dinosaurs knew.
It was exactly the third part.
It's from a carnivorous dinosaur.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happened.
There are very few times in life.
[A.DE.]
To warn you the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task.
To protect this rest to be able to extract it.
After several days we were able.
To cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was already over.
We didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
Even the next time given you came to the winter.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
And seeing if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found.
Or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day.
It's from the stadium.
And we realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur.
DB: Very good.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions.
Surely the animal.
There was dead.
A layer of a lake and it has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way.
That's it.
And that's where the scavation begins.
Following layer, layer, those sediments that were burying.
Where it opened us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time.
Going back to the surface, an animal.
That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Jennemal had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps that were accumulating up to gather meters and meters.
And that food was transforming.
Or in sedimentary rocks.
And in that same process, bones turned into fossils for chemical reactions.
And then all that package of dry rocks buried.
I had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming.
Well, from all this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosion.
We have to start discovering.
The layers I contained to this dinosaur at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those mistakes.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun.
Patagonic wind that doesn't lose.
And then we were able to carry.
All this rest is protected by layers to the lab.
At the museum's lab, another stage begins.
It's extremely long where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing grains of grain.
All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's when we can see for the first time the complete skeleton and we can see.
I see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
I was studying anatomy.
DB: Of these rests, what we saw.
It was that it was a relative, an ancestor.
Of the dinosaurs and those measures of the south hemisphere.
And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before.
And that's what they thought.
Many before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supermarket.
Now not all the discoveries follow this trajectory.
Because some discoveries do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, of some rocks like these that transported.
Until the museum, knowing there are fossils, but without knowing it.
We arrived inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
The milk was quite complete.
And he told with a very well preserved crannel and with some very strange teeth.
Dents in a way of hand, and that's why we call this dinosaur.
For this dinosaur, it's very particular.
It's something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is...
It's a replication of this dinosaur.
Today, it's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end of the tail.
And this mining of dinosaurs didn't look like anything in the forms.
We found what we knew about the northern hemisphere.
Studying their rest we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same old age.
And this wasn't so surprising.
But if you see in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of Pange.
It's still not formed of the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two contents today.
But we had a case again.
of restricted animals, unique from hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the hemisphere.
We started to find other cases.
What did this pattern be adjusted?
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived at this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us.
It's one of the environments of this time.
Speaking of climate models, what we see is that at this moment...
In Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert.
Or in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century.
It was a big desert what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve.
In an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere.
It was...
The lack of water.
That's what I had isolated these.
It wasn't a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy.
So we are really fantastic, fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It's that they take us to understand.
The chapters like this are the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
It's rock.
They graduated for millions of years.
That's our plan.
"When?"
That's it.
To animals.
And the plants that lived in it.
I've graduated while they were going to be informed.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of websites.
It's written throughout 4.500 million.
And life.
It occupies a place to reply.
In this story, in the last 3800.
That there are millions of pages yet by reading this book.
And if we really want it?
To know our planet.
The weather, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today.
It's fundamental to know their story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Audience: Yes.
It's also key.
Rossect.
a photographer.
Chico.
I didn't want to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies.
I dreamed of competing.
And contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of...
defending small villages of terrible without dancing.
Then time.
It's not a reality bathroom.
It loses subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter.
Sometimes, without losing small villages, and you don't have the passion of patterns to defend them.
But something about that child's vocation was in me and almost without realizing it.
But I dedicated all my life to looking.
And to try to understand how these superpowers work.
What is my imagination?
But in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas.
To develop one of the main superpowers.
Or maybe?
And the most important thing in this situation is to live.
And what is the superpower of thinking better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
What I'm going to tell you are my ideas, I learned them from others.
And this is perhaps the main idea of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed.
But I can develop it.
Putting our mind with it.
Ideas powerful and practicing.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others.
Let's think about it.
A: The first one.
Imagine they enter a gym.
Look.
That's on the floor.
A few steps, bikes, daughters.
And it will be half-volt.
They go to the bar, they have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they get married.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't improve.
That's it.
Third, it's going to happen.
It doesn't count being able to think.
Because it counts to think.
Let's think about it.
They develop us the habit of technology.
And we give time.
That's it.
Intelligence is not something that has one.
Is it something that is used or not?
It's been one.
What does the saying?
Who only sees a mattress?
Now, those who only have a mark see all the problems as a piano.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
And it's not about their keys.
If we have a tournament, we need a better disorder.
And if we need to cut something, we need a brain.
It was a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, to solve more problems.
And tools are called mental models.
If we only have a mental model?
We can think about all the problems with that model.
It's as if we tried to take a two-nils with a circle.
Or if we have many mental models.
Well, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models find?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, in Tanzania and Argentina.
There are mental models in the old Egypt for 3,000 years before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
I said, "No.
But all the problems will seem uncled.
Recently, I was in the club and at the table of the side, a man told his friends that he had told him about all his son's soccer teacher.
Ahead of his son and his classmates.
For a mistake, the teacher had committed.
Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him something.
Alpha, that's it.
But it didn't realize it.
(Laughter) What?
What does this mean?
I was creating a much greater evil.
In his child.
I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends.
And I was underestimating the teacher.
Go ahead of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning a scale.
You don't know how to have success in that scale.
And without knowing it.
We do things that make us lose in other most important scale.
To have a discussion.
And to lose a friendship, for example.
The money, the freedom, or with freedom and losing more.
When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think?
How to act?
And the principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the zoo.
Or maybe the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impression is to have the emotion.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
Well, many Chinese situations arrived.
But those acts didn't have impressions.
That generated emotions.
And that's not how we act.
When they started to reach Italy images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These expressions generate emotion, fear.
And the means of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what we are living.
This time we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone seemed to us before.
But many times...
And it's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating?
This is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric.
Keeping is a thing.
He's hungry.
Did you get married?
You have an immediate break.
You eat what to get married.
But cultivating is very different.
It makes the effort now for something that will take advantage of for six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But to come generate applause.
Because you're avoiding something.
That nobody is a benicient.
But I save lives.
And we develop our ability to act before feeling.
And that is to say, to develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main abilities to think well.
And let's think about a million.
What do we have to anticipate?
And now?
That we still feel, we live.
From now on?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last a month, it's very sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
In kilometers, we are exhausted.
And if we program it to run 20?
Nine kilometers are unbearable.
Let's take a story of resilience.
But the key of resilience is to handle expectations well.
The sixth and last.
Have you ever met a well-known place?
You're walking through a village in the middle of the ship.
A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago.
You can't create an unlikely chance to find it in that place.
To find that classmate, in that place, is totally unlikely.
But we know so many people.
So it's very likely.
To find someone in a very improbable place.
That's it.
It happens to us all the time.
Well, with the rest of the same life, are there so many unlikely things?
It's very likely that something happens very improbable to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the improbable is impossible, and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
And not now, my field with more formal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live where uncertainty is.
And it always leaves many open doors.
Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible.
There are serious things.
Although they are very likely.
And if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have cars with the storm of birth full?
Specifically, why once?
You found yourself in the other side of the world.
With a secondary classmate that I didn't see that sequence.
In other words, at first, what I wanted to do with this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being at the end.
To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking.
Audience: And people.
With which we cultivate these ideas.
We are able to empower people who enrich.
It's a way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
We try to change our own ideas.
A 40-year-old interview, the interview is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewed told me, "This same thing happened to me."
That same question four years ago.
That's it.
I don't know what I've done.
Sunday.
And he said: "I ask for excuses."
I haven't had a lot of time to think about these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that makes us live.
To be accepted by new ideas.
Of the new ideas that are emerging and being always open.
Let's change.
Women are irrational beings.
It's always given to the emotional sport.
That's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family.
Or at the beginning of their lives?
They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
It's a manual.
For children's education and young people.
It's about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, yes.
And it has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, at all times.
In 1915 no country in the world could vote.
(Video) In 2015, that is, today, 66 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
In 1910 Marie Curie.
He won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
But...
The academic of science of France said he didn't have merit.
What does it feel to be academic?
And the first woman in France.
The science Academy was in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here have already finished the primary.
Because university, leaving, has a very prestigious business school.
That's up to 1925 to now 50 years ago, that's celebrating.
He let a woman do the master.
And Hale University admired women recently in 1970.
The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow.
Well, this was.
This idea.
That women only serve to create children.
Audience: Yes.
And that helps the husband.
And it's a rational series.
What a cistery!
In fact, it was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment.
And almost all, taking 5,000, maybe.
They believed this idea.
But it was a true fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living.
The most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions that we've lived in economics, if you are nothing on the other side of this.
We're leaving ice cream, the idea that truth is.
It's true.
The idea that truth is a lie.
And there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
That is to say, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem.
So now neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this.
We can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world.
It's not the world of objective.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it.
When you say that there are no facts.
That there are interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretative mark? What day is it?
On September 24th.
Does anyone doubt it?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because all of us here are in agreement with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Ebreo, in the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, each IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
And the cats live without calendar.
My dog applies to the chest and who's very lonely at home.
(Laughter) "No, making some misfortune."
I didn't know the time, I knew what I had become.
But don't look at the clock.
But if human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
And he looked at me to fall a apple.
He wrote the gravity law, "What a genius!"
But that's not how ideas arise.
And ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, I would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
I would have missed the trips I made, know the animals I saw, all those who had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc.
Besides...
What about it?
And to discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years by the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print.
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea.
In other words, wise, geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is the one who generates it.
The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born.
But he was born in the 19th century.
And the same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now.
This is what we see in scientific movements, technological innovation.
They are increasingly more developed thanks to this new paradigm that there are not facts, they only exist interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
In other words, revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were...
Those who took care of the house and created the children.
And yet.
And in less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
The half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that lost humanity.
Think about the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels.
How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
In other words, errones are monsters.
There's an idea.
That we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half and that example, to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, "But how, the Greeks, the Romans, the pingüins, and all those things."
In other words, relationships between...
People from the same sex, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, in all times.
And they are even documented in many animal species outside of humans.
But I had never thought that sexuality of a person.
It was anomal, as it was called at that moment.
It didn't determine.
Now, how was a person totally created sexual identity?
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of art.
Moral Vittorian, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a kid.
It's stronger than it exists, because the same thing that turns into a catholic church into something we want to do.
(Laughter) You don't have turbine.
(Laughter) You're going to do it, but it's going to give you guilt.
It's true, it's a big control.
Great!
"You don't say."
To the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
Audience: No.
That's it.
It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it.
Isn't it?
And then, that is a form of terrible social control, because it dominates us.
It's no doubt.
On the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they private us with me.
We can't stop eating, that's why we are all good.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, the waste was created where everything that was wrong, the society of the sexual point of view, put it there.
And homosexuals during a century were terribly pursued in the whole world.
They don't have the right to talk.
My right to stand up, the same as women before.
Audience: No.
Or that Jewish it.
Or that blacks, without leaving slavery, we didn't talk about when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, in some situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century.
It's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago.
Two years ago.
We, homosexuals, in Argentina, didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, this is just to get up now.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
To be frightened.
But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, for paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all depressed.
They assume their identity.
But they make themselves respect, and then they also understand that they are also human beings who have full right.
But there is a drama of social struggles.
And one has to get into jail that discriminated me.
To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish.
To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman.
To take the sea so they respect me as black, only black, and the same thing is gay.
And the gays, women, Jewish, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictories.
So maybe I don't have to get rid of it, what am I doing?
I said, "No."
But, however, we have to add that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
Of the cards.
50 years ago?
They have to live alone.
I was a homosexual child.
I didn't know what a homosexual child was.
Mom.
I didn't know the homosexual word either, and my colleagues told me: "Gordo, we're going to do it."
"Thank you, don't look at me."
I didn't know what to do, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual.
Nothing.
And at the same time.
I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me.
That I didn't know it was.
And I came back home, from school.
And I saw that my father loved me.
I looked at myself.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so that it would come out?
Keep!
I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual.
I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there is.
I had a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jews here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person like any other person in the world.
With trajectory, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual.
We are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close the 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea that I had.
It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist.
Interpretations.
It's not the contradictions and it's going to say, because it's really that, we are contradictory.
There are no facts, contradictions exist, and contributions are also interpretation.
What do the facts exist?
There are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place.
I had to take up there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said.
And when I signed it.
Because when an idea breaks, it's that it doesn't mobilize, while we only have it in our heads, it doesn't serve us.
And I made her body.
I left prison.
And I left my house.
It was such a wonderful thing.
Do you think the State is expensive?
What is a nationality?
That's it.
That's it.
That's the one that's not there.
It's true.
In other words, living constantly with this one.
Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
It doesn't understand the things we need.
And if better I had the things I needed.
Exploring is something difficult.
Aterrator.
Every moment there is a place, they are completely different.
The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations.
It's a moment.
It was long or worse.
full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know is disappeared.
When everything you do is paid for someone else's voices, you don't even have a microphone.
It duplicates the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstacles.
But once you say it, once you make your words, you get a avalanche of ideas that come towards your speed.
Each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain and you are chosen.
You open your paraguas and cover it from there.
Or to do one side and in part with each one of them.
Each moment is a combination of energy, to keep jumping, robbing or copying.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated, learning to harm your own movement.
A class isn't bad, with a dance class I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment and that even if life builds music, movements believe them.
There are movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing.
There are moments.
They keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
Remember that I probably don't know.
Thank you very much.
But they will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
In the formula you saw that face, when you spoke about what you loved the most, the speed is the one who went to your heart.
Or how do you start when you talk, that voice, that voice that so much you know, that you probably are looking for something you lose?
DB: That voice.
Your best friend, go there forever.
It will be the first one to defend, the first part in a little kitchen to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it.
That's it.
"You're a better friend."
A single photo.
Let's go for water.
A library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without that, it's a canasta and I can't survive.
What we created in cities.
No, it's cool.
We chose one time.
I say, "The opportunity is to get rid of it."
Very well, thank you.
I can't go to a state job, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
That's it.
That's it.
It always appears in the scene.
A person, for those who will have already entered the year.
Canoza.
And with a belly, you remember your experience, otherwise.
Do you remember that all the time spent was better?
It's really this.
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer it.
To think about this.
Unfortunately, I remember my friends of all life.
And Juancho, Franco and Manuel.
(Laughter) These photos are seeing there.
It's from 2009 when I saw the secondary school.
What can I tell you about my friends?
Because I want them a lot.
(Laughter) What are my brothers?
And that they are three super-capable people.
That, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to be able to stay like to study what they liked.
They stayed at each city.
AC: And go to surprise.
Until today.
They can't get a job that allows them to get closer to fulfill their dreams.
And for me, I want to be in this picture.
The brand of opportunities is also present, my parents, who are workers.
And they made an effort about humans so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I didn't know that if I stayed here in the city.
I could study the other, but probably the future as a person is quite opportunities.
Have you ever wondered why these things happen?
Audience: Bigidi!
In the middle of the 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and advances are due to a speed that surprise us all.
(Laughter) And they deprive the borders and the barriers that insist between people.
And in this context?
And cities to make more and more important cities.
Let's make sense, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence.
It is estimated that for the year 2050.
68% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would be almost 100 out of 10 people all over the world.
Seven out of every day.
If each other more people choose to live in cities.
And it means that we have greater possibilities to progress.
What do two teams explain?
(Laughter) While the city is closed, they look like time.
Others progress, they are vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them.
I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to record here.
When they get out of that door, to return home.
"What?"
It's strategy.
If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world.
I'm part of my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships.
It happens precisely for that.
To connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
Not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through complete projects.
Because it improves the quality of life of the population.
(Laughter) And they avoid migration to other places searching for a future.
Once again, inevitably.
I remember them, my friends.
Who is it?
(Laughter) It's a photo, a few months ago, and so you can write a couple of things.
Let's start.
Let's add a fifth to my opinion.
Do you know what it is?
(Laughter) The baby alcohol.
Secondly, we can also say that it's given a kind of hyper-personal relationship.
As I was improving the quality of the photos of the phones.
That's what we're going to improve.
Have any of you ever had a couple of threads?
(Laughter) And we have to serve the fight.
(Audience) But...
Do you know what we share until today?
And beyond the deepest assignment we have of some with us.
The lack of opportunities.
Franco, for example, is the one who is also there.
That's it.
It was a national champion of geography honesty in 2012.
Bio-national.
(Laughter) But today, although it's left to publish a school teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be some students working to be able to live.
I said, "And then?
Do you have a source?
It's the one who's left behind me.
And the bathroom of their audience.
(Laughter) How much did I want to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the security forces in the best country?
But, as I didn't count with that possibility here, I started changing my career without finding what was really passionate about.
And I can also build a job that allows seven economical defendances.
The last one is Manuel.
(Laughter) It's a genius of interpretation, but they don't know the geniuses.
And you see, any thing.
(Laughter)
All day working in their local that built from the ship.
Is it going to college to study programming?
And you can't develop your potential and keep learning what you like.
Because they don't count all the necessary tools.
(Laughter) Please, it's a presuppor in diversity.
Time studies programming, and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
(Audience) Yes!
We, as young people, don't have it.
Nothing we don't know.
There are fewer than the rest of the world, absolutely.
That's it.
According to English, I had the huge fortune of being the election between a group of 8 young leaders at a World Cup.
(Laughter) To participate in a week in New Delhi, the capital of IN.
I left the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I would like to share with you, that's how it works.
At 1:00?
There are millions.
You can never understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
(Laughter) For all the tastes and for all the colors.
Audience: Yes.
There are discourts that are found, they don't come from the Sun.
And in one of the two.
(Laughter) But don't see the important ones.
Our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I don't have one to ask the best to be obvious, nor to the kids, nor to anyone.
Do you know what the differences we don't have?
What do you want?
And there's a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them.
Once again.
We don't want better cities.
We know it's strategically new.
I remember.
(Laughter) When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could stop studying.
And with three days to fulfill 18 years.
They were me.
I'm very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult.
And all around me know for everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city.
What is your home?
(Laughter) It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
And even today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
"Why is that?"
I don't have to go to my pocket.
My friends?
And nobody who knows.
But it's necessary to give them tools to our youths so they stay in their cities and can grow from there.
GG: So, who's beautiful?
To give them wings to the city you had to do.
And with a strategy, what can we do?
Imagine the brilliant.
"Are you going to be strange?"
If I could dedicate myself completely to geography.
How much?
If today they had one of the strength of security in our country.
Or for us to be so far from Emanuel.
If I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I was doing.
Is it like that?
PK: Ah, yes!
Thank you.
AC: You see the short side.
For you.
DB: All of this.
And I decided to tell you.
It doesn't seem enough to them.
Do you want a more example?
I'm fine.
[A.DE.]
PK: That's the taquar.
They tell me when I finally finish.
That's it.
It's the depth of a girl.
(Audience) In Latin America.
"You have to do it."
Two suicide attempts.
DB: It's innumerable.
DB: Psychologic sequels?
Audience: Bigidi!
A lot, a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop going.
We have to go out strategic.
In the soil.
Well, we don't put them together.
Thank you.
I'm here Lujez.
Since always, surgeons.
We think that to have more work.
Or we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
QD: In my last 10 years.
That's my research.
Well, in my case, in the zoo.
It went on.
Or to look for it.
To see the reasons.
To operate less and less to patients.
And that's it.
We can do it in several ways, for example, looking for genes.
To detect more early diseases, like cancer.
And so you don't have to operate it.
Can we do it?
To help tissues to repair.
Well, by themselves.
They are using their own ability to regenerate.
What does this mean?
Well, we do it.
With biological and maps.
What do we give them?
I went to the roof.
To use their own capacity.
And to restore yourself after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope.
To make procedures.
And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out.
In other words, robotics is giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate this task.
DB: What's left before.
It seemed science fiction, today.
It's almost daily.
Alucinating.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
(Audience) Yes.
To have more and more patients to operate.
It gave me a lot of satisfaction.
What about me?
And there are a lot of patients.
Well, they avoided.
I had to make a surgery.
But with all this I told you, I realized.
That developing methods, increasingly invasive.
[A.DE.]
Well, every time.
Let's start.
No reflection.
Especially what a collective culture can mean.
In a moment like this.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese.
And also in my work of many years, I've had contact with issues.
Literary.
sociological and anthropological of Japanese culture.
And I believe that certain behaviors and answers.
Social and individuals of the Japanese society.
They can help us when facing a crisis like this one.
It's worth asking us a first question.
Why Japan?
I was able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage.
If in January the first case came.
Being so close to the neighbour.
Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space.
Having the populations of third age, older people in the world.
Being in the second country with more smoke.
For the amount of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus?
It hasn't had an exponential growth.
But a advance.
GG: Great!
And the identified.
Until now.
But we know that this new coronavirus is very contagious.
In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail.
This would allow a great spreading of the disease.
Many people, basically, in little place and a room.
From that people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in such a way.
That responds organic and humidly to any event that compromises it.
Japan went through war.
Tephoneste, your name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
1,000 temblors per day.
Generation, transgeneration.
It has had to overcome catastrophes.
S: Natural.
Co-generated by man.
We can think of this with something that likes Argentines a lot.
Spread teams like an example.
What football team will make better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day.
It has infrastructure where each one knows what to do.
Or the team that never entered.
It doesn't have infrastructure and it has to go out to improvise.
And what about directives?
I have social distancing.
hygiene and individual behavior.
Be in society or in your own house.
The Japanese population has not established.
It's been a hundred years ago.
It doesn't need to say, it doesn't embrace.
It's not to give up.
Because they don't do it.
It greets with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public places use a lot.
It's not necessary to recommend, to take out the shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used.
But we don't have to indicate, we don't have to turn our third on another person.
Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies of years show.
What more than 50% of Japanese?
They will use board to feel frightened.
It's not to protect yourself.
I said, "If not to protect others."
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good of the whole.
It's more important than the wind and a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They made two Western teachers.
In a school, in Japan.
You will surely know the game of the chair.
It's called music, chairs in a circle, a less than the quantity of participants.
And they will get out of one.
In each round.
Have you made this experience in Japan?
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because embarrassment, winning.
They know when they suffer.
The word " japonesa" loves "expresses this way of being."
It's about having confidence that the other will take care of me.
In resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others.
In the example, there is a child.
But we can already see how a collective society works.
You help yourself.
Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
