I have a message for your children and grandchildren, and I need you to help me swimming. It's very simple. We need to learn, feel, think and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself in the Lombocan Street, Indonesia, at 30 meters below the water, with that feeling of ungratulations, of tortures, of mold fish, of all colors, I had a feeling of being connected with nature. It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience. At that moment, I observed as a small fish, black and yellow ships, a fish bank came out, and it was just in front of me. We were looking at each other and I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking. It was a very spiritual feeling. And that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right? It's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell you it. They look at each other and say: The teacher is crazy. But I'm not crazy. And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. He works 24 hours a week to draw that artwork we're going to see. On the contrary, the maritime stream would take it. It's a mandate that we see, proves that nature has consciousness. And that I'm not crazy. And if I'm able to talk to fish, will it be true that the original people can talk to birds or plants, with rocks, with mountains and with other natural phenomena? I think so. In fact, I bring you more scientific tests. Last year, the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed. Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between inmates and predators. In other words, for every four bottles there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? Paradoxically, in amazing forms, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology. According to the law of Cleber, an elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse, but three rooms. If you stop thinking about it, the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right? So I ask myself: Is it a mere coincidence? Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness after thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic co-evolution? That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research. That is to say, all those sciences that integrate and unify the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being. That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development. And here I bring you a summary. And I remember, with the scientific consensus, with the explosion of the Big Bang, the Universe appeared to 13,700 billion years ago. The planet Earth was formed between 4,500 and 5,000 million years. And the miracle of life between 3800 and 3.500 million years. During the first half of this period, the forms of primogenite rhythm of the Earth kept very simple levels. With the appearance of oxygen free and atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated. With the Cambrical exclusion of the Microsoft, the biological variety has been increased to great speed, creating a wide range of multicellular organisms, like, for example, the trophy. The previous thing seems to indicate that life came up and the depths of the oceans, it wasn't able to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago. I'm talking about the disappearance of the Kurassic period, 66 million years ago, the hegemonic period of the mammals started, where one afternoon came from, the first or two pieces. Thanks to fossil remains found until "Tchac" is known that the other Opitecos have four million years. Or deaths, one of two million. The near dental men and Homo sapiens, 200. In today, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that cohabits and co-evolution in the planet Earth, along with the rest of its biodiversity rich. From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants a few 10,000 years ago, and especially from the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendental way. But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed, as something unbearable. (Music) Species between species. A 30-year-old Parliament, or maybe 100 million species, a single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species. And that's how it's crazy. And we are all responsible. Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs. The human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around them. This half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them. If it seems we've forgotten from Hirosim and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, the future generations are also threatened by the ecological fingerprint that we leave in the breastfeeding, our Earth's mother. Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth. Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity. According to the World Cup of nature, if all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours. But we don't have four planets, right? That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming. And what does this mean? Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater, and we take fire to the bottles you are sitting in. Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbari, right? Well, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. A chronic scenario of natural resources. And they will be able to develop in a dignified way. That's why we learn to cooperate. Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones who better adapt to the middle. But he forgot to define the concept of cooperation. If it's true that there is violence and predation and excessions in all forms, in life, in nature, what defines it is not competence, but cooperation. I'll give you an example. Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach a novel, to fertilize it. What defines life is not a competition, but a symbiotic union has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one. That defines life. Cooperation. The football, for example. We all know that a team competes against another. But what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it. Our body is a plural cell phone organism where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are. Paradoxically, nature is the best way to imitate and perfect to achieve sustainable societies. After 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses time. It has suffered catastrophes, ice creations, meteorites, and constant processes of trial and error. But human beings create ideologies of linear thinking, political doctrines, like anarchism, that failed, communism, which also failed socialism, and capitalism has also failed. A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest 99. This is yes, it's crazy. And that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren. That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because they murder nature to obtain economic benefits. We sent the outside space and we received nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea. The money has colonized life. And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. Dio, life, my medicine and myitation. The imitation of life. But this is not new. This is already been born in the originary villages, the indigenous peoples for thousands of years. It's something inside us. What is this faculty? I invite you to make a game of imagination. What happens to this verb? How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us? Well, it occurred to them to make a plane. What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"? The Japanese did the train Bala. And with this "Murcié Lago." We could make a trunk, right? And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites, we could make bioclimatic buildings. With this sun turn, a plant of solar boards. As we know, there are millions of species in nature. Therefore, bio-inspiration is practically infinite. Thinking that nature, but we continue to be there forever. And we have to overcome the cognitive phase of the GDP. What does the country mean? Many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb a lot of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material for the industry. We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren. And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started? Imagine a dialogue future with their children and grandchildren. I would like you to tell me, "Dad, at least you try it, fight." And you, what would you like to hear? Thank you very much. (Applause) And what I don't want to tell you is that the quarantine has our opportunity and the bread keeps me a little. It's a horrible thing. We just spoke about it, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, we go wrong, socially with good. Let's go to your friends. It's tough. There's nothing to do with respect. And don't know why to think that it's an opportunity to take advantage of and that we are not part of something, if we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn it. We had a lot to do. It's not a terrible breast. In fact, life doesn't treat anything else, that happens horrible moments and they learn from them. We tend the pain, the disease, we depend on war, we die of death. If we do it, we will continue to do it. So, that's going to be now. And what I was thinking about entering is an idea in which I was meditating from a book called "The Modornal Thessio" and "Sinness of the Rexarmon." Two newspapers that Germán arrived in the 80s, when they diagnosed with HIV, and then he decides to return to his childhood to Jardel. But that's not a kid who, in fact, after his diagnosis, made a lot of very important movies. It's not important for your career. The child's decide is that they're going to buy a land in a horrible place and take care of a kindergarten. But what impressed me, as a person writes, is that to take care of a garden it wasn't to do time. Well, going through the mouse, not like now that we spend the mouse cooking without bread or whatever. Changing and throwing. The only thing we do is the keyboard. These are the only tasks that are forbidden. Think about the concept of reproductive work, which is a product that comes out of sexism from Free Gengers, basically. And that, specifically, the feminist weapon to talk about reproductive work. On the other hand, the productive work, which is the one that puts new things in the world, can we say? Being a patio, of course, it doesn't matter. And this reproductive job is to reproduce the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, take care of. Basically, you cook the workers for the next day to put the factory. I work for the worst. And feminists spend a lot of time already increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also work. What we assembled is that reproductive work has economic value, why does it serve to make productive task? Because if the other players don't eat it, in the factory. Now, why do we think of that relative value first in an absolute value? It's even more, because we don't do it as an excellent index and think that this difference is contrast between productive and reproductive work is a given difference on one side, of course, gender, for eternalized cells, for young people, for important women. And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the original subject, the world where the subject is made. If you take care of it, take care of it, it's something that doesn't make you special, you don't originate, you make an artist, you don't make you think, it's an important thing. These are values we know, we don't have to accumulate. I think it's the opposite, even it says. The care stops are the most important. Every day we are living without advertising, without writers, there are a lot of things. I'm still without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning. The world didn't go round without ants. And without care. And without nurses. And without health. The only thing that allows us today is to eat and cure and clean. And this is the world of magic. So, those tasks have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value. Not only something mechanical that we have to go through the river, that I hope I could not do that, clean it almost, not only that, but cooking, nor solving food. You can think about it like this, we thought about it for a long time, but what I thought when I read to Germans is that I can also live them in a different way. We can live them as tasks that have a wisdom. The tasks in which we are also involved as human beings, that are not mechanical. And that also has to do with thinking precisely in this which the title doesn't naturalize modernity. Actually, not as the human being separated from the natural world that only makes something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but the relationship of care with nature is also something interesting. But I have been careful about our bodies, right? With general, we think that we have to take care of the body, the genius, the cooking, only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter. But that is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body. The truth is that our mind is what we are and that the body will do something that we have to survive. It seems that this is an opportunity. And, in fact, I want to return to my life. In the world we don't need more novels and I want to write novels the same. That's how life is. We all live in this contradiction and life for absurdity. Now, I thought, "Well, why not give the world to need more novels to connect in the place of obsessioning ourselves being productive in these days and to know all the colds and with all that, why not think with the world, with the body, with the other ways, from that?" That's why, when they invited me to do this, I think it wasn't, but I didn't have a pretension of an original idea. I don't tell you that the world doesn't need any other idea. But that's why I thought, we were going to write reading. To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already there. I was careful that I had with my books and that maybe I want to tell other people. It's more than writing, reading. But what to do, take care of it? Thank you very much. People, when they go to a diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat. Nomas Pan, the most dulces, the most posters. It's enough every 15 days. Fast, a end of the middle. These foods don't engage. What matters is the misunderstanding and disordered way we consume them. That's why I want to name three key aspects to have a good food: The first is consciousness. Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness is secondary to brain activity." With brain activity, sorry, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if the consciousness rate to our desires we would never choose a food we wanted to eat. But on the contrary, the one that doesn't like the most. And after this, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating and in what amount. A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger. Because when we have a man, it's not a man of a man, it's a man of everything, and it's hungry and heaty. And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attempt. And if it's diet and restricts fast foods, it's constantly thinking of pixas. Dreams, grandmother, a fuel with double wealth. So, going back to the subject. Are we really able to say "pixa"? Thank you very much. They prefer a store. Impossible, right? The second aspect is the practice. To eat, like every process in life, you learn. And in this case, and in many cases, I include myself re-aprends. Let's learn to eat in station. What does this mean? First, the foods that have been collected at that time. This will guarantee us. In the control and in balance in our weight. And by putting a god in our health. Why? Because we don't know Because the proper foods of their time are the most natural foods, they are the richest foods in nutrients, and they are not treated chemically to subsist in time. That is to say, they are not additioned with calories and necessary for our body. It's normal to see fruit all year. It's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer. So this mechanism has led us to practice where we won't fall into the monotony of always eating the same. And the last aspect, for me, is not smaller, but it's one of the most important in moderation. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, they also give them anxieties to repeat the plate of purchasing with fruits. To think, right? So, what do I want to say with this? Men accumulate. Because hunger is not manipulable if they are restricted in food, if they get out of food. And what is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion. To do it more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top, every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength. So, if we don't stop each three, four hours to take a collection, that snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat and we will unfold with all the food around us. To conclude, along with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose and not. The most expart body gets into reserving, and when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this today, everything we want to eliminate from our body. The food doesn't only make you fat, we leave, please, of ignorance. The family can hurt you or cure you. It depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding and in what amount. But the moderation. Just like the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, it should exist a coma with moderation, such food stimulates overweight. To give you a closet, I propose you to eat everything you like, eat various, but always take care of the portion. Because of nothing, there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "The death as a prince" and "sene" as I mentioned. I think many of us know it. The health has excuses. "I can't, I don't have it." "It happened to me hunger, or even worse." It's that I died of amparagus. We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly. Thank you very much. (Applause) For a while, I'm obsessed by telling stories of scientific women. I love it. The first one that seemed obvious: Marie Curie. But they gave him a Nobel Prize, they were two. So it deserves its pedestal. But there are many others who didn't get a Nobel Prize but did incredible things. Recently, I entered the story of Eugenia Sacerdote. Engine was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war. I made great contributions. Among them, the most important thing was the one that brought the vaccine "Salk against polio" in the 50s. Thanks to her, thousands of lives were saved. I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002, I work at university doing research. Engine works actively until 2004, and they say it was very copied that you could go to talk to her. And do you know what? It died in 2011, it was 101 years old. I found her very little. How did I lose it? They gave me an idea to the bronca that gave me. Being focused on them is very little. Thank you very much. That's why I tell stories of scientific women. To honor those who were gone, but above all, to not lose those who are there. Thank you very much. (Applause) We spent a long time in school learning ortography. Children keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. What is a new ortography missing? I think yes, what do you need or better? Fear, I think we need to simplify what we already have. Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language. They have been bouncing from the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Spanish language, Antonio de Nebrijas sent to our ortography, a clear and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write. Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today. It's because Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, has always had a strong resistance to writing too different from how we pronounced. But it's not, because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions. That other criteria was etymological, the one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, Latin, Greek. And that's how we stay with dead acts that we write, but we don't pronounce. That's how we stayed with long and short waves, that, unlike what many people believe, they never differentiated themselves in the pronouncement of the Spanish. And that's how we create congeses, that sometimes sound as "aspers" as in people, and sometimes they sound soft, like a fool. Yes, we stay with six, six, seven, three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others, but none to three. I'm going to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience. We all went to school, we all invested large quantities of this time of plastic and infant brain, indicated, in the memorization of orthographic rules full, however, of exceptions. They transmitted in many simplic and explicit ways the idea that in ortography something was fundamental in our training. However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important. Even a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled? What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes. Ortography is useful to uniform writing so that we all write the same. Therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it. But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example, in ortography there is no individual, involved ability. In punctuation, yes. With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase. With punctuation I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no. Or is autography good or bad, according to fair or not adjusted to the smart norms? So it wouldn't be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms so that all that time we dedicate them to the teaching of ortography we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity deserve time and effort? What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want. The language is a common use tool, and therefore it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria. I also think it's fundamental that those criteria in common is the simplest thing that can be done, especially because if we simplify our ortography, we're not leveling down when the ortography is implemented in nothing the quality of language. I work every day with the literature of the orologist's or Lego to Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo, who sometimes writes: "Men, signs, sometimes write with a decoration, or lack of convinced in their time." Not of quality. Let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story. I mentioned that insistence a little reflected with the teachers knocking us and shocking us with ortography. But the truth is that being things like you are, that makes sense. In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows us to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is written. You can get or stop getting a job for a H, that I put or stopped putting. You can't become an object of public bubble for a misunderstanding. So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography. But we shouldn't forget that, throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers or linked to the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed ortography, sometimes, there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge. In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that, effectively, had the place in Spanish language, which was the one of Chile, in the midst of the 19th century. Because then, not taking the position of those teachers and start moving forward in our ortography. And here, in the intimacy of us, 10,000, I would like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. Let's eliminate Hémula. That's where we wrote an H, but we didn't pronounce anything, we didn't write. Nothing, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attach can justify for someone all the fats that cause the dead H. Belarga and B Corta said before: "We've never been distinguished in the Castellana language." We choose one, it can be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument. We want not with one, we eliminate the other. What an idiot do we divide the functions, that the ice stays the Sweden, Gato, Mago, Aguila, and that the joke retains the sound "Asperó," Jarabe, Girafa, Argentine. I know that Iceta is an interesting case because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle. In some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended. Now I said before, I know that Iceta, in some places that correspond to a sound in other two, and from three letters, we go to two, we are all better. But some of these changes may seem a little dramatic. They are not so much. The Spanish Academy is linked to the stories, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes this apex to history, traditions and customs are transformed into an obstacle for today's use. But it explains that our language, much more than those we know, that we have geographically close, were modifying historically made of theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol to symbol, and, little by little, now, they start to remove themselves blindly some clouds in the dictionary of the Real to the academy, armony, and we are all fine. It also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion. Men tell us that language is spontaneously below for above, which are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications, and that authority, in some places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts them and incorporates them. This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of success, for the level of words, it's less true for the grammatic level, and almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above. They were always the institutions that fixed the norms and proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment? Until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks, but at our time, the time of social networks is suffering a revolutionary change. Never wrote so much as now, they never wrote so much to the view of so many. These social networks, for the first time, we're seeing large schools, novelous ortographic uses, where even impecable ortography people and predicted when they write in social networks, they behave quite similar to how the majority of social networks behave. That is to say, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication. Now there are unstaotics, individuals, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that follows writing, new criteria. I think we would do it wrong to reject them, to discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decade of our time, no. I think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinant normative with the needs of our times. I can anticipate some objections. Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic. A simplified ortography, we're going to recover etymology at the same place we're going now, to the etymological dictionary. The second observation of those who say, "If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguising between yes words that differentiate only one lyrics." That's true, but it's not a problem. Our language has ormonies, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit the money, the suit that we put from the things we traveled. It was enormous majority of situations, the context dissipates any confusion. But there's a third objection, for me, the most comprehensible, even the most conmoved one of those who say: "I don't want to change." I educate myself like this, I get used in this way when I read a written word in simplified ortography: "Don't hurt my eyes." That objection is within each one of us. What do I think we have to do? To do as it's always done in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to and wait for time to feel the new norms. The success of all ortographic renovation, that touches so arraigated habits, is in the prudence, consensus, gradualism and tolerance. We can't let the rule, the old customs, prevent us from going forward. The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive. And I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography all those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us. All of this is convinced that if we do that in the modest environment, but important of language, we will be leaving them to the next generations a better future. (Applause) And even before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes, I had the eyes of coffee with a shelter around Liris, and tell me: "My mom, don't blame her eyes." After his death, reality didn't make sense. I had to understand life and death. Perhaps by my training as a photographer, instinctively, like when he gives us, I felt the need to look at his seeds at the microscope. For the surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images, the discovery that made my view of the world transformed. The whole universe inside my mind. It was like being floating in the universe. It's like being that space, an exciting space, without body. It was absolute content, it became peace. This image, do you see it? That's the image of my microscope father's seeds. And this other is the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite. I fear and my sadness disappeared. It doesn't make sense of disconnection of anything or anyone. His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project. For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence is perhaps in that reflection, we are addressed by the cosmos and that when we look at the mirror, infinitely more than we believe in. The matter is not created nor destroyed, it becomes more a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. Thank you. (Applause) In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy and space technology. Your satellites travel around the planet. It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating. What should we create an IMAP from education? Imagine a public agency that designs content and strategies to transform learning, that develops the research of borders to use, for example, artificial intelligence in the education of a large scale. An agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you, so that this is possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term. They wanted to reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management. The first step is to think of the state as a possibility, not as the variable of all the adjustments. Just like that, changes in education will not benefit from the most advantages. (Applause) I'm not a scientist, and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. Many times, on this way, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations. Invasions extraterrestrial, from great loves, even pandemic. Until the fiction became reality. And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking more questions. From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide. For example, the world's obsession would buy mountains of hygiene paper. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous has an unconscious logic. In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer. It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive. Why does failure live with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy? It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public. This would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology, called optimistic blind. It doesn't happen that many of us drive or drive while we speak on the phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in fact, we won't happen to us. And it made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, are more moral or social. Why does this happen to us now? Unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas. For example, in the Budonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States, when, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city became a series of rats that were really propagating the disease. In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to avoid people who are already sick with other people. However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more squares. This first makes people who are healthy and don't tell this. It's important. And beyond another reason, perhaps more important, is that if you don't use more sheets we get sick, then this would be a kind of accusatory excuse. Knowing who is sick and who doesn't use the most expensive names. That they use it in the whole world is a way of avoiding the stigma and with this, of taking care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered the most in these days is our extraordinary capacity for change. In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, why is it impossible to change? The truth is what really lacks us is motivation to do something. This is a discovery now. For years we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it. However, in three days, all children educate themselves at home. We don't know some consequences of this. We learned that we are willing to do it in the early need. And the world keeps moving. Also, of course, our values, our judgment. About two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority to us. And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment? A dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future. Imagine the next situation. We are at the beginning of the pandemic. A public consensus that includes the World Health Organization, but also governments and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move, to whom we find, and also data with our body intimacy. Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our viral charge, and we can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who. Let's suppose that this consensus can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way. Those who are old and stay at home, those who are not at risk can go out. We keep this mental experiment imagining that with this we really keep the effect of the epidemic. It doesn't disappear completely, but it moves in a lot less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to give our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them is still true. There's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic and you could choose if it looks good or bad to do this, what would you do? And I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention that is there, between one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pillar in our culture. On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and most efficient to solve pandemics. Maybe we have our data a little like vaccinating us. It's a succession that we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social impact, to take care of us and everyone. A while ago, with the HIV, a luck also leaves freedom. In this case, sexual freedom. We found a good solution of commitment: sex, conservative. When all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free and careful? If you go home, you're going to fly less in a sky. Will we change the way we greet? Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want it to be the preservative sex of the coronavirus. My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patabone, Argentina. I've been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me. This was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nowhere, an animal that had lived millions of years ago, and that probably nobody had seen before. The animal I found was similar to this, and as we call it "dolars of sea." Parents from the sea herits and were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years. At that moment, I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out. Today, there's something about the fossil that I didn't know, it's extremely fragile. The dollar of March fell on the sand and I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way. I'm interested in fossil fuels, nor fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been, in the past, kept me captivating. They took us to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet. Approximately 100 million years ago, our planet was very different like the one that is today. It was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but that the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other reptil groups. The action I told you 100 million years ago, which is a quantity that we paleontologists mentioned daily, but which is very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stadium, which are many people. Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people. For 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a amount that doesn't enter the head. That multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us in our heads. Well, the life led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago, it has traveled deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions. Like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, watching fantastic fossils. But it has also led me to a very special place, which is Patagonia. And when we say Patagonia, we naturally think of these forest landscapes, lakes close to the crop of the Andes. But for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered. We have, fortunately, many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs. The vast majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia is the last period in which dinosaurs live in Earth, what we call critical period. Then it's approximately 70 million years ago. We know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere, the dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while, at that time, in the North hemisphere, the famous Tyrannosaurus rex had. This difference between the North of the South wasn't surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the North hemisphere. But what happened before this stage that we know well? What we call "jurassic period," 100 million years before. At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea. We know very little about what happened in this time, in the Kurassic, in the south hemisphere. It's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet. Specially 60 million years ago, when dinosaurs for the first time dominated the planet completely. The first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores of omnivores all over the planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic. And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found four years ago, locked up like this, walking. Later on, in a lot of heat, after walking all day, I started to return to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor. As I got closer, as I got closer, I became more clearly what it was: it was the traffic of a dinosaur. Because I stopped next to me, I really stood up. I asked what it was, and I knew it was. We were able to study years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what the track was of a carnivor dinosaur. Finally, I couldn't believe it. I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life. We started to warn the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of protecting this rest to be able to extract it. In several days we could cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum, and we started to take it below. After the expedition, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum until the next time given it was coming to the winter. It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the next expedition. We needed to open the excavation and see if there was something else, it was only the channel we had found, or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day of the statition, we realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur. It's something very rarely in the dinosaurs' shoes: it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a position of life. In front of the animal there was dead, on a lake or on a lake, and he had been covered by endless glass caps, preserving his sketch in an intact way. And he begins the escape, really, reading, staying, cap, those sediments that were shaking us where he opened us. It's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time it's going back to the surface an animal that lived in that same place, but 60 million years ago. Guys, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments layers who kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of training layer. And that food was transforming into sedimentary rocks, and in that same process, bones turned into fossil fuels for chemical reactions. Then all that package of sepultated rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some levanty of all this block. The rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until we started discovering the layers that contained this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those dinosaurs looking for those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting to go discovering the juices, it's a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun, the Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to take all these protected remains to the lab. In the lab and the museum, another stage is extremely long, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big steps, all the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs. And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizáurus. According to the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relative to those carnivores of the south hemisphere. And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before what we thought. Many before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separate themselves being debated by a big ocean. It was a pange moment when all continents were united in a great supercontinent. But not all the discoveries follow this trajectory. In some discoveries we really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there. For example, of some rocks like these that we carry to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks. The bed was quite complete and counted with a very well preserved meat and with some very strange teeth. People in a form of hands, and that's why this one doesn't speak and we call it "manidance." Now, this dinosaur is very particular, also, for something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world. What I have here is a replication of this dinosaur. The dinosaur is very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton. This project wouldn't take more than 50 feelings from the end of the head to the tip of the queue. And this dinosaur mining didn't look like anything in the forms we found or knew about the northern hemisphere. Studying their rest, we could see that their closest relatives had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same kindness. And this wasn't so surprising because if you see in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of Pangea. It hasn't been formed of the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents today. But again, we had a case of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and that they didn't have anything to do with the North hemisphere. We found other cases that were adjusted to this pattern, and this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived in this time, in so many fossils that have been found in this region. And also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us from the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic. It used the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century. It's really true what had isolated this fauna making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere. In other words, the lack of water had isolated these fauna. It's a desert full of water. Actually, when we think about dinosaurs and we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really realize fantastic organisms, fascinating. They have challenged the limits of the body size, the history of life, have diversified and achieved all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing is that they take us to understand chapters like this is the history of the planet. We, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years. There are millions of pages yet by reading this book. And if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today, is fundamental to know their story. To know the past is key to understand the present and it's also key to design a future. Thank you. (Applause) Many of us, when I was a kid, wanted to have superpowers. Whileicipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies, I dreamed of competing magical powers to build things. I dreamed of defending small windows of terrible invasors. After that, it gives us a reality bathroom. Maybe it's the subway and you don't have the magic little bar of thesearry potatoes. It's imperious to empathize small villages and you don't have the position of standing mixes to defend them. But something about that child's vocation that gave me and almost without realizing all my life, I dedicated myself to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work, they are not my imagination, but in the real world. Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers. And maybe, the most important thing in this situation that you have to live is the superpower of thinking better. Obviously, there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better. Today I want to focus on which I think are less known. I'm going to tell you about my ideas. I learned from others. And this is perhaps the main of all ideas. It was like the zero idea of what I could tell you. We are able to learn. Our ability to think is not given or is it fixed, but that it can be developed, ideas powerful and practicing. So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine they enter a gym. Look at those on the floor, parents, bicycles, daughters. If you give me a return, you're going to save, you have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and you're comfortable. It works like this, right? Our body doesn't improve with this. Well, compensating happens the same. It doesn't count being able to think. What counts is to think. We have to practice, think. But they take us the habit of thinking. We spend time thinking. Telegence doesn't come out, it doesn't have one. Is it something that is used or doesn't use? The second says the saying that, now, who only has a mark, sees all the problems as a keyboard. But if we have to take a tournament, it's not useful for a mattress, nor to make a key account. If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing. If we need to cut something, we need a bear. A box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems. The tools are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model, as if they were trying to release a 2,000 with a bear. If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful. But where do these mental models find? Sure, we take them out. They find us in different disciplines, in different places, without different times. For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology. And there are also mental models that are different in Japan, in Tanzania and Argentina. In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ, in the Middle Ages and in our time. And to think better we have to expand the box of tools in our heads. No, all the problems will seem a key. The third one: I recently was in the club and in the table of the side, a man told his friends in front of his son and his classmates that had told him about the teacher of his son for a mistake that the teacher had committed. Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher. I didn't realize that by saying this, I was creating a much greater evil in his child. I was leaving it as a tone in front of his friends and I was destroying the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn from him. Many times, we don't realize that being focused on winning in a scale, it makes us have success in that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another most important scale. It was a discussion and losing a friendship, for example. It's a dish and a freedom. It's a freedom and losing love. When we act, we think about the impact we are going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think as acting. The first one taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. And the impression is to have emotions. Emotions make us act. For example, in the pandemic. There were many data from the Chinese situation. These acts didn't generate impression, they generated emotions, and they did not act. They started to reach Italy images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China, those impressions are generated emotion, fear. With fear of generating action, that we are all now assessed preventively what is moving. But we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone appeared before us. But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel. The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. Knowing is something. You have hunger, houses, you have an immediate reward, you eat what you get married. But cultivation is very different: it makes the effort now for something that will take place within six months or a year. This is the pillar of almost everything we have. But to come to generate applause, because it's avoiding something that no one is well-being, but saves lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling, that is to develop our ability to anticipate, it's one of the main skills to think well. Let's start a minute. We can't anticipate now that we still feel, we live. In the fifth grade, we all evaluate things according to our expectations. Something bad lasts three months if we think we're going to last six months, we're happy. I feel bad, it lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad. It's the same time, it's three months. But we live them completely different. We programmed them to run 10 km, for example, to 9 km we are exhausted. We program them to run 20 to kilometers, we are unbearable. We have a story of resilience. The key of resilience is to handle the expectations well. Maybe there's the last, have you ever met a known place in a very serious place? I'm walking through a village in the middle of the Nadi.com. A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago. You can't create an unlikely chance to find it in that place. On the other hand, finding that classmate, in that place, is totally unlikely. But, as we know so many people, it's very likely to find someone in a very improbable place. In fact, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of the same life. There are so many unlikely things that happen to us something very improbable. The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible. Hello. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis that little of the future. We don't know what will happen. But now, my field with more formal times. We have to learn to live with uncertainty. And the best intelligent way to live when in a certain man is to always leave many open doors. Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible for serious things, even if they are very likely. If someone ever asks you why do you always have cars with the Atlantic Ocean Testal, you found yourself in a village in the other side of the world with a secondary classmate that you didn't see for 15 years? In other words, the beginning that the idea of being or this talk, surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn. Learning has to do with being accepted. To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking and people with which to grow these ideas. To be able to enrich ourselves in our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others. We try to change our own ideas. A 40-year-old interview, the interview is a question. And when Borges answered, the interview told me, "That's the same. And he answered to that same question four years ago. Borges stayed quiet, looked at him and said: "I ask for excuses, I haven't had much time to think about this subject for these four years." We take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live to be accepted by new ideas, of the new ideas that are emerging and be always open to change our way of thinking. Thank you. Women are irrational beings. Always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family. At the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father. And if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband that they will have to take care of. (Laughter) This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for the education of girls and young people on the marriage that circulated in the whole planet in different translations in the decade of 19:30. But the idea in itself has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915, no country in the world could vote. In 2015, that is, today, 600 years later, 65 countries are governed by women. In 1910 (Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize. It's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize. (Applause) But France's science academic said he didn't have enough merit to be academic. And the first woman in France, who entered the science Academy, was in 1979. 36 years ago. Many of you here have already finished the primary. The University of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, left a woman to be a master's degree. Hale University admired women in 1972. The Prince University is born in 1974. And we could continue and follow. This was the idea that women only serve to create children and help their husband, which is a rational, that is hystéric, it was a truth made to a century. They believed it in the same women. There were 1800 million people in the world, at that moment, and almost every five,000, perhaps, believed this idea. It was a true fact. Why did the world change so much in a century? Moreover, in the last 50 years, when it changed. Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture. We are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm. It's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived in the economic systems are nothing on this side. We are leaving ice cream the idea that truth is true, the idea that truth is a lie. There are no facts, there are only interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world. 2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem. Now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this. We can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the goal world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it. When you say that there is no facts, that there are interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a kind of personal leadership, that interpretation is something subjective. The interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. What is an interpretative mark? What day am I? It's September 4th. Does anyone doubt it? What day is it for you? Well, let's convince it's on September 24th, because all of us here agree with the Gregorian calendar. But if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Ebreo, in the Jewish, or any of the calendars, or more than exist, the 24th century wouldn't have any sense. Every thing we say, every thing we think, each IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized. The cats live without calendar. My dog, yap, archaeator, and who is very lonely at home, doing some misfortune, I didn't know what now I had returned. It doesn't look at the clock. If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world that would be perhaps a little more stimulated, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind. They taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at an apple, wrote the law of gravity. Great! But it's not like ideas arise. Ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, I would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution. I would have missed the trips I made, know the animals I saw, all those who had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides discussing the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print. In the 14th century, I didn't even exist the print. It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea. The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it. The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born, but it was born in the 19th century. The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now. This is what we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation, that are increasingly more developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts only exist in interpretations, when we go to the economic and social field, the revolutionary change. As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and raised the children. And, however, in less than 100 years, countries governed, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women. Look at all the creative energy that lost humanity to think in the way women would serve us for nothing more than to clean panels. How much was humanity lost? How many remedies? How much intelligence? How much creativity? And the errones ideas are monsters. There's an idea that we can follow it because it was created a century and a half and that example to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality. Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world. You may say, "But how? Diego, Romans, pingüins, and all those things. And yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women or any other transgenere that occurred to you to imagine today, always existed in every culture, in all times. They are even documented in many animals outside of humans. But I had never thought that the sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally. The sexual identity is created. It wasn't innocent. It was the moment of the Vittorian Generation, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak, stronger than it existed. The same thing is to turn into a catholic church into something we want to do, you don't have turbies. You'll do it with guilt, that is, you'll do it, but it'll give you guilt. (Laughter) It's not true. It's a big social control. (Applause) It's not the woman of your fellow man. Or the man of your fellow man. It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it. That is a form of terrible social control because it dominates us doublely. On the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they were given to eat. We can't stop eating. That's why we are all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, a waste bathroom where everything that was wrong is the society of the sexual point of view and put it there. During a century they were terribly pursued in the world, they didn't have the right to talk or the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, right? Or that the Jews, or that blacks, without salt from slavery, we don't talk about when they were slaves. It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, it also changed the situation of Jews. None of these situations today is ideal, but we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century, almost 50 years ago. Ten years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, this is just to get up now. In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be fusilated. But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal. This was possible, for the paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all depressed, take their identity, respect, and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full right. But there's a drama of social struggles and one has to get into the prison that discriminated me. To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish. To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman. Look at me so they respect me as black, only black, and the same thing is gay. And the gays, women, Jewish, blacks, white people, we are all complete, complex, contradictories. That maybe I don't have to earn myself, what am I doing? But, however, we have to add that. Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison. (Applause) Fifty years ago, as a old man, I was a homosexual child. I didn't know what a homosexual child was. What's more, I didn't know the homosexual word, and they didn't tell me that either. My colleagues' classmates told me: "Guardo Puto, we're going to turn off." (Laughter) "Thank you, don't look at me." (Laughter) And I didn't know what to do, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything. And at the same time, I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was. I went back home, from school, and I saw that my father, who loved me, looked at me and made me feel that he would have done me wrong so that he could come out like that. What was it like that? I had to learn what to be like that, I had to learn to be homosexual. I had to turn less homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. To assume the identity there, I had the positive side, I learned to respect myself. I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same thing that I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not for them to rejected me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. I stopped being a person, and I'm a person, like any other person in the world, I'm against victory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings. And it took me 50 years to learn that I'm also a person. In other words, I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to serve 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity. In 20 or 30 years, this idea I had, that arises to understand that there are no facts that exist... (Applause) There are no interpretations, there are no castes. Because it's really that, we are contradictory. There are no facts, contradictions exist. And contributions are also interpretations. There are no interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that I was there to defend myself. And now I want to leave, I said, and when I signed it, because when an idea breaks, it's that it doesn't mobilize it, while we only have it in our head, it doesn't serve it, it says body, I left prison and left my prison. Is it so wonderful? Do you think jail is? (Applause) After that or they told me that there is a list of things we need to survive: the basic channel. What's the idea? Living constantly with this channel. Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to survive. What if better I had the things we need to explore? But explore is something difficult to land. Every moment, person and place are completely different. The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations. Adapting is a long or small moment full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know disappears. When everything you did is paid for the voices of someone else, you had a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obstaculize it. But once you say it, once you make your words, you get a avalanche of ideas that come towards your speed. Each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate. But some of these ideas are rain, and you can choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side and in part with each one of them. Each moment is a combination of energy, of following, of getting up, rooting or running. But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated. Learn to damage your own movement. A class isn't bad. With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment and that even if life builds music, movements. Movements that take moments. Moments in which you don't stop laughing. There are moments that keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories. Remember that they probably wouldn't be a work of art, but they would allow you to review the exact way those stars saw when they spoke about what they loved the most, the speed is the one who went to your heart, or how they broke when they spoke. That voice that you don't know so much, that you probably are looking for something. That voice, your best friend, will always be there. It will be the first to defend yourself, the first to walk in a little kitchen to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it. That person is a better friend, a microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend. Without that, I can't survive. (Applause) Because we created in cities of girls, I'm sure that we once said, "There's no opportunity to get rid of it." Nothing to be? Little by little, was it trapped? I can't progress in the way I would like to change. Wow! (Laughter) But do you remember that all the time spent was better? Really, this is the case. But we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us. Think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of all life, and Juancho, Ranco and Manuel. This picture you're seeing here is from 2009 when I saw the secondary school. What can I tell you about my friends? What I really want is to stay here in the city, which are like my siblings, and go to the surprise, to the day of today, you can't get a job that allows them to get their dreams. And as I am in Porto, in this photo, the lack of opportunities is also made present. My old man, who are workers, could study something, but probably the future as a person, would be a human effort for me to study what I liked, because I knew that if I didn't want, that if I stayed here in the city, I could study today, but probably the future as a person and spend short opportunities. Have you ever wondered why these things happen? My children are in the middle of the city. We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, in which successes and advances are like a speed that surprise us all and above the borders and barriers that insists between people. In this context, cities are more and more important. We're going to be honest, it's our home. And we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. It is estimated that in 2058 percent of the world's population will live in a city. If that number doesn't sound to you, it would be almost 10 people in the whole world. It's from every 10. And if more people choose to live in cities, what does it mean that we have more chances to progress? What do you explain then that while the cities look like to stay in time, other progress, vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them? I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to keep here, when you get out of that door, to return home. It's strategy. If we want the globalization to help us to provide more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. Part of my concern as a professional future in the field of International Relations, it happens precisely for this: to connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us. It's not in a way discriminated, but sitting in our strengths, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. Now, Time and Lan, how do you see all that, so beautiful that I'm telling you about real life? Through concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population and avoid migration to other places searching for a better future. Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends. This is a photo, a few months ago, and so, "Life can be noticed a couple of things. To start, we add a fifth friend to the group's friend. Do you know what it is? I saw something in case. Secondly, we can also say that it is given a kind of universal relationships in proportional. The idea that was decorating the quality of the photos of the phones, what we were going to improve. (Laughter) Some have a couple of kilos of others, we have to be in the middle of the waiting, but do you know what we share, until today, beyond the deepest time we have some of us? The brand of the lack of opportunities. Again, for example, which is the one that is also right in this photo, was the national championship of geography in 2012. A national champion. Today, even if you want to publish a school teacher, you don't have time because you have to be from Monday to Monday working to be able to live. After these fourths, you think my left is stronger. I won the subway. I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the security for the best country. But since I didn't vote with that possibility here, I started changing career without finding what was really passionate about. And I can't get a job that allows seven economical dependencies. Lastly, it's Manuel, who is a genius of construction. But they don't know the geniuses. The truth is, whatever thing. But then, every day working in their local that built from nothing itself, will college to study programming because they can't study their potentials and learn what they like, and they can't develop their potential and learn what they like for lack of presupport to their biodiversity. Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study. But most of all this I'm telling you is that we, as young people, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing. You know, recently, I had the huge fortune to be chosen between a group of 8 young children at a World Cup to participate in a week in New Day and the India capital. I was the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinian in that event, and I also told you it was an incredible experience. That is, my head came back. I learned a lot. But if there are two things I'd like to share with you, there are millions that I'm never going to be able to say with enough target, there are millions of opportunities outside for all tastes and for all values. But there are discourse found, they don't come alone. In one or two, but not less important, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant. I don't have a desire to come to young people, to be obvious, nor to children, nor to anyone. Do you know what the differences we don't have? Because they have a state that is present to go out to the world, bring them opportunities to them to develop them. Another time we want better cities. We know it strategically in the world. I remember when I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could study with three days to fulfill 18 years. I was very scared, with a lot of fear. This can never tell you in public because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult to leave your city than to play. It's like leaving a piece of your heart. Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by. Because this doesn't happen to you, and to your friends, nor to anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our young people, so they stay in their cities and grow from there. In the end, who's more beautiful than giving wings to the city who had to do it. And with a strategy we can do it. Imagine the brilliant I would have been strange if I could have dedicated myself completely to geography. Or how much would it be today to have in one of the things we had in our country? Or to not go so far away, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I have. "Yes." "Yes." That's how we're missing opportunities. Yes, all this that I'm telling you doesn't look like enough argument and want a more example. I'm going to hear it. This is the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I was able to overcome the deep environmental depression in which I fell a lot to overcome. If we want these things to stop passing, we have to go out strategically. In our favor, we don't take a final point to our cities. Thank you very much. It's a surgeon. Since always the surgeons, we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. In my last 10 years, my research, in my case in the zoo, was based on looking for the reasons to operate less and less patients. That can be done in several ways. We do, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so we don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair themselves by themselves, using their own ability to regenerate. This is what we do with biological and maps that we read to the tissue so that it uses its own ability to restore after a damage. And finally, with new technologies, we can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before we had to operate and take them out. Robotics are giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks. Because before it seemed science fiction, today it's almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate gave me many satisfactions. And there, and a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work. (Applause) I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. I'm not a doctor. My mom is Japanese. And also, in my work of many years, I've had contact with literary, sociological and anthropological issues of Japanese culture. I believe that certain behaviors and answers, social and individual societies, can help us when facing a crisis like this one. What's going to ask us a first question? Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage if in January he got the first case? Speaking in Japan, so close to China, and theified, having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space, having almost 130 million inhabitants, even now. We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious. In these demographic status, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great spreading of the disease. Basically, many people, in little place, and a room with more than 65. What happens then? Japanese is an educated society in such a way that responds to the organic and united way before any event that compromises it. It went with wars, typhones, tsunami. The Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 temblors per day. Generation between generation has had to overcome natural disasters caused by men. This is what we can think with something that likes the Argentines a lot: soccer teams like an example. The soccer team will have better performance before a critical moment. The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do. Or the team that has never trained, that has no infrastructure and has to go out to improvise. The directives are associated with their own house, the Japanese population has established it with social distancing, hygiene and individual behavior for hundreds of years. It's no longer necessary to say, not to embrace, not to give kiss, because they don't do it. He greets with a reverence. Daring distance is a gesture of respect. And most of the workers in public places use a lot. You don't need to recommend to get rid of the shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used. We don't have to indicate not to tune or to be on another person, because this is a usual protocol between Japanese. In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected, but to protect others. Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture. The good of the whole is more important than the good of a part. To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan. You will surely know the game of the chairs. They put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and they get rid of each round. I know this experience in Japan. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all following the place to a classmate. Because it's embarrassing to win one when another suffers. All the word "expresses" in this way of being. It's about having confidence that the other will take care of me. In resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others. In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works. It helps itself because each individual contributes to the good of everyone.
