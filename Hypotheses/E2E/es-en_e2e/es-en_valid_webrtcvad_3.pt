(Applause)
(Applause) In the middle of the wind, the air in the wind, the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
In other words, I'm Gélore.
So far from school to the 19th grade.
It's a good challenge.
The name is Dayo de Pierras, of Jaranás.
Music, orchestra.
The Chinese die.
From here to the Argentine Square.
We had a vision.
"Acel."
Have you seen the instrument we played?
A protagonist.
It's our popular music.
For this, we change the forest.
Let's talk about touching it.
In other words, it sounds like that.
I can dance.
Ladies and gentlemen, live in Europe.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
He was in the middle of the ground.
What do you have to sell to work on the reality?
We call them for video, each one records their part.
So the other can play on top.
And that's how we're talking about repertoire.
Let's connect with Tito.
In fact.
In the wind, the air in the wind, the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
In the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Of course not even those who suffer me.
It's really the case.
So, it's a failure.
And the relatives of those who haven't recovered.
What are you seeing?
The show isn't it.
They ask them to see stance.
But there's something new in this pandemic.
Something that...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the contents of social networks.
And to fight with that information.
We were already seeing it.
And don't worry about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there was already Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
But their consumption, their performance at a global level.
And it's up to my turn.
The pandemic, in the 19th century, is the first pandemic that coexists with infodevia.
What is that, what information does it mean?
Today is the World Health Organization.
It defined it as a practice of spreading false and malicious news about condemny.
And he called it "Materda."
Because it generates panic and anxiety of people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
We don't know.
But when health issues are referred, it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect you.
What can put in danger is directly our life.
(Sigh) I haven't taught you an idea.
From the amount of waste?
That these days circulate in Facebook, Instagram.
And you, Twitter, and for that reason, WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's been an idea, because it's up to being with a virus.
No one suffers the level of content without verifying.
For four weeks, with my team.
We work.
Without rest.
"Shut up!"
With false content.
A little subtle.
Do you really have the media?
That circulate on this new disease.
They know what we know.
And we are aware that we can't stop this avalanche of information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they are frustrated.
(Laughter) That's why I think it's subtle that tells you something we discover, something we find.
All the contents.
Pictured at COVID-19.
Can you?
To fit.
Or classifying in four categories.
I think by telling you about them.
You will be more prepared.
And they are more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this avalanche of information that come to us above.
The four categories are simple: The first one has to do?
With content linked to the origin of the disease.
Councils that say...
That a act of pioneer of two Chinese scientists stealed them in Canada until a English lab created this virus in 2014.
Nothing is true.
If you see a content linked to a theory that humans create this virus?
Don't take it seriously, discarte no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus is spreading.
A law located in a scientific study in a paper that provokes living a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media that we were not going to contagiate with only opening the window.
That's not the case.
There is no evidence of sound.
The third category is the one that is related to.
With false.
It's the most dangerous treatment, it's the one that has to put treatments.
More attentive.
Those who have to fight to be more careful.
It's not true.
That taking hot water with lemon we kill glasses and making hooligans with warm water, or making vapor, the virus disappears from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that there's already the vaccine that will enhance us.
There is no Cuban sweat.
That he managed to generate it and there is no Argentine who has already discovered it.
I was with a salvator.
Science works every machine.
To find treatment and adequate medications.
But at the moment, they don't have an answer.
Totally satisfactory.
Now, the fourth category of information is related to false measurements.
At the reach of different measures to the disposal of authorities.
Without farther in Argentina, the day he was disappointed.
The social alarming and obligatory, 15 days ago, or a little more.
(Sigh) A false secret circulated that said that the quarantine started at 3 pm of that day.
And obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent us from going to happen, but they do it without context.
Or others, perhaps, with those who may cross, who say they're going to fall on the Internet.
Not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And so?
It makes us fear.
That we are not only going to be.
locked in our homes.
But in communicated.
Information, it's in general.
They try to generate panic.
And we got worried.
That's why it's important that some of these contents receive, that some of these four boxes come from an official source, like the World Health Organization or the health Ministry, distrust.
Before finishing?
I want to tell you something else we learned.
Those who dedicate us.
"A chequear, chequear."
(Sigh) It's that...
We are not good.
With doubt.
We are not comfortable.
When the certainty is missing.
(Audience) Yes!
And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty.
Without all the care we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, it's not checking.
Don't share it.
Let's replace it.
I share the doubts.
It's so usual.
Ah!
I don't share.
For the doubts.
That's what we take care of.
If I received a content.
It's someone.
And don't take care of what they do.
Give me a box.
How did I turn it up?
Confidence.
And with affection.
And if you really share a content?
And then you realize it.
What's false?
Being a box.
Remember?
And correct them.
That's not time.
But of living.
The dynamic pandemic tells us affectionists, sanitarists, employees all the time.
There are changes every day.
Science works intensely to get the cure.
But wow!
And it needs time.
Menters?
There are empty of evidence and information.
Do we have to be able?
Maybe like a singer.
To tolerate that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in the modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure.
That we fill those passengers with blue content.
Why are we not able to tolerate our ignorance?
Let's be.
Thank you very much.
What if we tolerate them?
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
23 years ago.
I dedicate myself to accompanying people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
Some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned...
To work is the means of pain.
Of other people.
It doesn't make you a person or bitter, nor sad.
All the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every moment of your existence.
And to be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
But maybe?
And in a different way, like we wanted them to be.
But being able to see a miracle.
In an act of reconciliation.
Sorry.
Of love.
Or transformation.
I learned that the sense of humor is a very powerful tool.
That allows you to make a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
The insecurity.
And fear.
What do they generate?
The near presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty.
To be more humble.
And not to feel frustrated or failed.
When despite having done everything possible?
The result is not the one we expected.
I learned that when we are going through difficult times.
It's good to look.
And there are many people.
That they are suffering.
And in conditions much more attractive than ours.
And that allows you to put ...
Your own problem in perspective.
Finally?
I learned and still learn.
That it's not just about cure.
Especially.
Is it about aligning?
And to accompany.
To grow, love and compassion.
They help confront suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
To grow.
Love and compassion.
They can complain.
A path of transcendence so that others can transit.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Good evening.
Very little!
I've spent 40 years.
After writing several novels.
I wanted to write about more personal issues.
I took my pluma and after several pages.
But I realized that it will be inevitable.
Talking.
There are thousands of female conditions, millions of women.
Why do you introduce a man?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good evening, you're Mr. Durant, you're a writer.
For a woman, like me.
Do I have to decide good evening?
Is it a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why should we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I doubted a lot in starting my research.
Especially the female condition.
It was a very written topic in many articles.
It's losing feminity.
Feminity disappears.
The topic becomes fast, especially for women.
But that's it.
In the end, what is feminity?
Can we wake up?
And above all, that half of humanity is men.
And the other half are women.
Half of humanity.
Is it the masculinity?
And the other half.
Is feminine?
So why?
Do you ask us to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
I had told you.
I was going to write a book.
about feminine condition?
I would have surprised me.
Maybe angry?
40.
I'm really enjoying it.
Is it a topic?
It's so obvious.
But at the same time, they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her frustrations.
Different?
To a man.
We just need to go through it, it's to hide it.
To see that humanity is divided in two groups.
What a different way?
That they are seen differently.
And that they speak differently.
I liked my research.
Speaking of all beliefs about feminity.
The myths that exist.
about women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If it wasn't going to look for causes.
Studying more biological?
Physiological?
Picological?
Technological?
I hadn't happened to any man.
To analyze the peculiar condition of man in society.
The singularity of man.
It doesn't have a case, the shadow is everything, in most languages, the man is both the positive side.
Like the neutral side.
Men are humanity.
Men are all the main, it's the essential.
Would you die?
Is it the other?
It's the other.
Women.
The second sex.
Second sex.
Women?
It's not essential.
It wasn't defined by itself.
They define yourself in reciprocity to man.
That it's all.
So I followed my research.
I realized that in the history of civilization.
Many times they create excluded groups.
Exclusions like...
The blacks?
Welcome like the properties or the Jews.
But among them there is a community.
Look at the scenes!
What about us?
It's identical.
However, women.
Do you identify so easily among them?
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman.
Will it be more easily identified with a white man?
Because with a black woman.
A bubble woman.
Would you identify yourself easily with a bug name?
What about a prosecutor?
Women don't create community.
Women?
They don't say us.
Because they live disperse.
Inside it.
It's the group of men.
"Because it is."
At the chest?
It's quite satisfied.
Creating and feeling the king of creation.
Until the feminists.
Did you look for it?
Theories in religion, in theory, in biology.
To explain women's inferiority.
In philosophical discussions.
Several men usually interpel me to tell me.
Do you think it's a woman?
Of course?
As if by having ovaries and a uterus and the rule and hormones will take me away.
Any objectivity.
As if they wrote their stories.
Theories.
They didn't have their hormones and their therone texts showing them to think.
What I want.
It's to be aware of these differences and understand them.
To share what I understood.
I shared what I understood, why women do.
It behaves different from man.
And within everything I told you that I studied biology and physiology, etc.
I realized something.
That women's behavior hasn't been addicted by their nature.
It's not for culture.
Natura is that.
It doesn't spread all society, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
It's not born a woman.
It's coming to do it.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time it was recognized.
Like a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best in the worlds.
A complete individual.
Integro.
It's integral.
Many women stay in their feminity because man explains it.
It's very natural for her.
To get married?
Returning is the slave of possessions.
To have children?
To dedicate them to creating them.
Men explain that it's very natural to all that.
Therefore.
Your feminity is summarized to that.
I don't want to change the female condition.
For that, it's a lot.
What I do want to do.
Is it as a scientist?
To raise awareness about these differences.
And I started to synthesize.
That you can make decisions.
With the pre-volontate.
What I want to share.
It's that each woman.
And each man.
It can, and it must decide.
Especially what they want for their sexuality.
Especially what they dream of doing their family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do in work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to be aware of.
What is this effort?
It has to be done together.
Between men.
In women.
What I want is to become aware of.
And when the second is sex.
It will have answered these questions.
And they are living them.
So?
We will live in a society.
Complete.
It's powerful.
That's it.
Men.
"He die."
Totally complete.
And books.
Thank you.
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
To be honest, I can tell you that you've studied for today, you surely know the thinking that it's a hymno in search of freedom, an hymno that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go.
Like the golden waves on mountains and collines.
And in the end, I said.
And this expectation is for you to give it.
The suffering, the value.
It's something that wrote it: "Berdias, open your mouths."
More than 100 years and us.
We can take it as ourselves.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now breathe, surely they've been breathing at home, but now...
I don't know you, right?
Now we're going to respect specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
(Applause) (Music) (Music) (Audience talking) "Hi, how are you?" (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) "Hi, how are you?
(Applause)
(Applause)
A couple of years ago.
A group of friends in my school was going to go out to mark for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me no.
In any way, I was very young to be alone, that I was afraid of what could happen.
And then I told him, "OK."
And if you don't have the desire you go with them?
I accompanied my voice.
And my mom?
That I didn't steal a mark from the time of the Foncín.
I came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we arrived.
Look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a lot of surprise.
Wow!
A kid's kidney.
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the thing equals understand each other, right?
That's why my mom resulted so surprising and unexpected, it's something that today is super natural to me.
Talking about politics?
That is to say what I think, to go out to mark for what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think it has to do with that I grew up with a almost strict diet of books and movies about teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, generous cronics.
What are the stories of my generation?
In all of them?
There are villains that oppress.
That they described the rest that they say to be more.
And in all of them?
There are teenagers.
Children like me.
They get up and fight to build something more open and free.
It doesn't surprise me at all.
The attitude I see in many teenagers is respect to politics.
Even sometimes it seems that another option doesn't leave us.
Why did they not educate themselves thinking that when you are living in a distopy?
Because it's a dark and indeciable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put us head in a distopy.
A territor like climate change.
Where we are, young people.
What are we going to pay the account?
Sometimes I look around and I feel we are living in one of those books.
But where there are one of those distopies, they also have to be those protagonists who reveal themselves, right?
In any place where you make a dead bowl.
It has to do with Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
(Applause)
For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all the areas of our lives.
In the culture we consume.
In the stories we tell.
In the versions we choose to believe in what we think is good or bad.
Even the bonds.
For me, they have a political dimension.
What happens to me?
Sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me by calling people who make xenophobos comments.
Or to discuss about political things.
And while many people prefer to avoid these topics.
To not generate fight, its uncomfortable situations.
"Yes."
I have to do certain things for which it's worth fighting.
And that discussing with someone for their political position.
It's not the same as fighting because I'm a mouth and a River's voice, that, in the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't appear, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a family member does a sexist comment.
I'm going to discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against the egalitarian marriage or the abortion law.
I don't avoid the subject to keep peace.
I talk to this person.
Your opinion.
And I tell her my own without embarrassment.
And when we talk about a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things good?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about the other and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say better to fall.
I say, "Let's talk."
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it gives us a lot of fear, because only talking can be built our future.
And to rethink our present.
I wish, we begin to see the protests and political spaces in general.
Not as something dangerous, something scared.
But as a space of personal and social growth.
of union and inspiration.
And I hope there's always, but there's always place for teenagers.
And that you can look at yourself with pride.
And to say without any surprise.
It's full of kids.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours every day?
Playing a valley like this one.
To bring water to your house?
Can you imagine the water that was inside?
Would I be like that, contaminated?
Did you have this color?
The world crisis of water is a fact.
It's a reality before we can't close our eyes.
And we will all have to face ourselves in the future.
That's how the majority of countries signed, members of the UN.
That attended the day by global action, climate by water, a couple of days ago in Morocco.
Water is life.
And without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings.
What about us?
We are composed by more than 65% of water.
And despite that.
Every day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, manantial lakes.
Through agriculture?
From the livestock of our great companies?
Even in our own daily activities.
Although we don't realize it.
This is not just the result in the appearance of diseases around the world.
But it's the direct cause of the death of a thousand children a day.
1,000?
Children a day.
Second World Health Organization.
More than 740 million people, to 2016.
They live without access to drinking water in the world.
This is supposed.
What if we choose to 10 people randomly from any part of the Earth?
At least two.
Will they have serious problems?
To have access to water.
Do you bring that number of people at least 60 million?
It is found in Latin America.
And if we think about this, it turns out in some paradoxical way.
Since this continent counts with 35 percent of the water reserves in the whole world.
And if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, that, for example, Peru.
Isn't it true?
What was the Octavo País with higher hydric reserves in the world?
Do you have at least 30% of the population?
Without access to drinking water.
And that if we climb a little higher to Mexico.
A border with the United States in America.
Where, by the way, the man Trump wants to build a wall.
Which separates even more to these two countries?
Almost 20 million people.
That is to say, around 20% of the country's population.
Live without clean water every day.
All these numbers, those looking back, made us wonder.
How is it possible that a continent with natural wealth?
What do you find in this situation?
This question is exactly the one who made four doctors.
Good afternoon everyone.
Let's leave everything.
We grow the bags and we go back again to take drinking water.
Thousands of people in Latin America.
He got married.
Until Peru.
Are you walking like this?
Raise your hand, guys.
Let's do it.
It's a piece of caravan cars so that we call the white leg and, above all.
The organisms of a huge desire.
To return to the world.
Luckily, we did have it.
That's why we were born.
We launched the adventure.
During the path, we were going to find rural and rural communities.
Trying to see, they have water at home.
All of them were able to laugh, bones or marantials.
To be able to see.
Always.
With a common problem.
The water is in this pinete.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three days to purify the gift.
Can you see it?
Do you love it or directly buy it?
Just like you can imagine a huge amount of resources.
People who don't have it practically.
Do we have money to buy these bidons?
Or resources in time to look for the leg and then avoid.
And we asked ourselves.
What can we do?
To help solve this problem.
By doing the base that we were no experts in matter.
Raise your hand to the work.
After many weeks of research.
Do we find a system?
The female filteration was adapted perfectly.
To the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to teach how it works.
A filter that works practically like...
It's very funny.
The water contaminates, goes through the child.
And this one has all the particles.
Most of them with a molecule of love.
Sergio Feferovich: Let's do this crazy, clean water.
Returning 99% of all of them.
So thank you so much for health.
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water to quality in an immediate way, in addition, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider.
That requires the same weight of the map to make the future work.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these paintings?
In the life of all these people?
Well, that's it.
[A.DE.]
We want to tell you a story.
It's the story of Leo.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old young man.
That belongs to the 15th October 15th.
In Latinity, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And ending being a teacher in their community, but unfortunately...
Both him, like all his people.
There was a lot of money and time.
To get drinking water.
As the manandial of which Sebastian was very polluted by phosopsyptics around him.
To our mark?
Leo was written in a English course.
Isn't it possible to imagine?
The illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see, to all those...
All those people in those communities?
How did they spend big part of their resources?
To be able to fulfill among other things?
It's your dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to...
To describe it well.
Right?
We delivered 788 family filters.
And 14 community filters.
I destined to schools.
From now on?
More than 15,000 people.
In Mexico or Guatemala, Nicaragua.
Columbia, Ecuador and Peru.
They will have access to drinking water for around 10 years.
And now, thinking about it, thinking about two years ago.
And when "water" they go to the project.
It wasn't just an idea.
Well, we realize a little about the dream we have in the opportunity to live, right?
But in this dream?
We've never been alone.
Before leaving?
More than 400 people?
They brought their goal through a crowdfunding campaign.
Which was destined 100% to the exclusive purchase?
From water filters.
And nine months later.
Fortunately, we don't tell ourselves for thousands, right?
Together?
Have we created a social movement?
What has made the trip of these four friends?
An unstoppable face against water crisis.
But it's still a lot.
It's still a lot to do.
Or even millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the global crisis of water...
Can it be one of the risks of the biggest risks?
Although human beings are facing.
In the next 10 years.
According to the World Economic Forum, what is not that we call it?
So?
We call ourselves talking about it, it's the question "What?"
How is it possible to have reached this situation?
Why would I have reached this situation?
It's not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In the West.
We have created so many necessities.
All of them are unbearable.
And sometimes we don't think.
In what other people suffer.
so that we completely satisfy all of them.
We, in this project.
We have seen it with our own eyes.
We have lived it personally, we have developed a project in Mexico for many months.
Where did we see it?
Like big embotellers.
They were appropriating the manuals that supported the communities, so they were taking them out completely the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, what are you doing?
For those lands.
The big oil producers.
The big oil.
For us, all of us.
Can we guess the deposit of our vehicles?
What they are doing is to contaminate.
It's destroying the forests and the rivers.
From communities or Amazon's oranis, we have been there.
And it's hallucinating.
They are making communities have to move.
And in a future?
This is what will cause, probably.
It's that it disappears to its culture.
It's really incredible.
Not to live it, it hasn't left us.
What has left us open.
It's really something that...
It seems and we really think it seems.
That it doesn't affect us any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world's crisis of water.
It's a reality.
That it's not just.
It affects the developed countries.
The world crisis in the water.
It's a reality that...
November 12th.
That's 2016.
It's directly affecting us.
All of us and each one.
In this room.
You don't need it.
Let's go very far.
In California?
A world of technological development.
It's changing people.
To consume too much water.
They are cutting them in their minister.
For several hours.
A Spain.
In Spain we also suffer drivers.
We are one of the countries of the European Union.
What else will the water shortage suffer in the future?
What if really?
We want to pronounce a change.
If really?
We want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is all of us.
To be aware of it.
What we have to do is to motivate ourselves.
It's learning about these problems and what we have to do is also educate all our children, all our families.
What are the problems and real needs?
Do I do it with it?
What are the solutions?
Because they will really be sustainable.
What we have to do.
To support local projects, our city that are trying to reduce water consumption.
That little NGO.
It's trying to build poths in Guatemala to dress these communities.
Because, unfortunately, they continue without having drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise a bit of pressure.
It's about governments.
Who are the ones who can really?
To change.
The day these big companies would say that today.
Of course, things are not doing well.
We really have to appreciate and value.
The incredible luck we have?
To reach our homes.
To open the water bottle.
And that always comes out of water.
It's not like that.
Let's please let this resource hurt.
It seems not to us, but to believe me.
It's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to trust ourselves two and act.
And we have to do it already.
Because, what happens if we really become aware?
But we don't act.
That's how we won't get the change.
What do we want to see in the world?
Luckily.
They exist.
Many, many times, to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact in others' lives.
This one.
It's our way of doing it.
What's your?
(Applause)
(Video) (English) One, two, three, four, nine, three, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, ten, nine, ten, nine, ten, ten, ten, nine, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, four, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten,
(Applause)
What's beautiful is for now.
Keeping up so many faces, attentive.
I started the conference making a commitment with you.
Science determined that we are sources of energy.
And that every time we think, we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
It can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotions.
And he bought...
The emotion has a thousand times higher than thinking, the frequency of electromagnetic that creates a thought is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emits our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Neni."
Talking about the heart.
I commit myself with you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
If you open your heart, you can surely receive 1% of what I'm going to say.
And that we stayed trapped in our mind.
We've probably received only one part, so that's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask you a question: quickly, especially in front line for...
To put ourselves without context, how is society today, raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
It's fast.
It was separated.
Stressed.
Revolved.
Confunded, aggressive, faced.
A patient, standing.
In my conferences, it's still today.
It's 30 to 40 possibilities that you see me in this kind of answer.
You've seen the answers.
That's it, right?
And then there's another question.
Someone in this room is happy that raise your hand those who are happy.
And well.
Those who cry happy, raise your hand.
There are about 500 or 17 people here and everyone raised their hand.
I assure you, if I give you 100 possibilities that tell me how society is today, none of you has told me nor happy, nor happy.
You are.
What are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we refer to, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if you've always told us more questions or more answers, you've told us.
In that line.
Sorry, discreet, faced, unmoralized.
Do you know what is called this?
I'm never.
Menter oriented to the crisis.
When you ask something, the first thing we say is.
Everything we need.
Everything we're wrong, everything we're sitting in the media.
Information where ...
The answers that take once and go to school, we take the day to the kids, and we tell them, "Let's look for the good news."
The bad and the neutral, the money of the day, right?
How many good do you think they find or how many neutral?
One, two.
Now, well.
This is what happens to us when we naturally ask a question or an impulse of how we see society.
And then we have...
Another big problem has to do with sports that are fashionable, when I ask this, sometimes the soccer says, the basket, the rugby, well, I'm going to tell you the fashion sports for me that are fashionable today: the first national sport.
The complaint.
We complain about everything.
They saw this, if we first complained about the weather, checking heat that creates three money three of the afternoon, "Oh, how crazy!
What cold does 7 am July 7 am?
The danger we take out of the weather after we complain about...
The traffic later we complain about the country, well, we complain about my wife.
And if we don't complain about something?
Something goes wrong.
When they ask me, "How are you, perfectly well, full of happiness?" "What happened to you?"
"Oh, you don't have to complain anything!"
So we have transformed a society that is funny.
It's like a title we have, we complain about everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with the complaint.
This can't be this, it has to change, this is a disaster, and this has to change.
I decided to change the country, society, my wife, all the time, we are complaining everything, so we transform ourselves into complaints, which is funny, complainologists.
And the maximum: Opinologists and allologists.
Or, let's look at all, did you realize?
Some time they listened to him and said:
Of this, I don't feel able to operate.
Let's wait for everything, I introduce it to my friends, I'm a friend Fernando.
I went to bed with him and I said:
"Because without batteries on the cell phone, you know why you stay without batteries, because it rained the leaves, you know why the leaves climbed."
Do you understand that the owner is working there, well, we already know everything, or we think of economy, politics?
And here's something more worrying now.
We have started to have our mind oriented to the crisis.
We complain, complain.
And we are immersed in the opinion.
What does it do?
We've fallen in a sort of vital stancing.
You have to get out of our house with the cared cell phone 100 percent and, in addition, we take a...
It's a chargator for the doubts that I don't have a lot of load, but with our energy.
Watt.
We started the day.
With a vital setting, with a chance of cancer.
That, besides, you don't know if you lose power, why because if it's good?
We need everything to change.
That the country where the weather is, I don't know what, because it was little less funny.
I arrived to give a conference and went with the remix and I wanted wonderful.
And the reply says to me, "Yes, but tomorrow it's announced rain."
(Laughter)
This is how we're losing power, and there's something...
In this, I want to focus, besides being in this society and leaving this society, especially in our generation.
What have we left in our society in a moral crisis that was not even the most perverse mind in our grandparents could be imagined?
I was faced, restricted.
But we are making our children believe.
But we serve for nothing, that we are corrupt, mentirous, that the success model is the famine and the money we don't have the future.
We stop this, but we make them believe this, how this phrase is represented.
"Let's see how the orchutans are."
And what do you want?
We are in Argentina.
We listened to this and if they were the worldwide, they said, "What can we do?"
We only leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in the generations they can't change.
A mistake, this is self-compliance.
Now, well.
For a long time, I was there, I started to believe that knowledge was important, so I graduated.
That the skill was important to get out of that world where I lived, that I was complaining, that it was a hell.
That talent ...
It was important, I had to have talent, experience, and I was more informed in this, I saw that all of them joined, right?
So I looked for more knowledge, more ability, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add, but the attitude.
Multiply.
The multiplying attitude and you know that all the amount of steel is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
This is a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, it's a negative type.
If you have a pessimistic attitude, that's a pessimistic guy.
And if you have a merda attitude, that's a kind of merda.
Sorry.
So I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude?"
How to get out of this position and the first thing I saw is that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change the attitude and what was to get out of that victim state that had of everything that happened to me and I started to decide to be a protagonist of my life.
I started to decide.
What am I going to do?
Those who looked for the changes I wanted to see.
That's where the victim's posture of all the time is justified, criticizing, complaining and starting to prove.
What happened as a protagonist and the first thing I saw is that the installed is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a meter, depends on you, from nobody else than you.
And of me, and you know what, here in this square meter, live in the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world.
With one...
A shirt that says "I respect."
It doesn't matter what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to contagiate you from the example, because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see.
I started to decide to live in a different world because living hell.
I went through the hell, I didn't remember once I went to the subway and I told him, "Mrs. Dame, three reasons why I would have to keep living, wow, I was very bad."
I was in the nurse and I lived in the paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
There's also me in love, full.
But hell and paradise is not a place.
It's a decision because the hell I have it there by side, tomorrow I can come back, it's a decision.
Where I pay to see everything I lack, not everything I have.
When I start to complain all the time and operate all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter, vibrates as I want, and you know that one is what you do, but also what you stop doing.
If all the time we're waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to the student in my talk.
In other words, we are what we did, but we are also what we stop doing.
All of them have the same possibilities, we all have the same possibilities.
I started educating.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's a single one.
With the example: every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, this is the way to educate, being the image we want to see, starting from our square meter, to emit energy first, protagonist attitude, I'm the protagonist of my life.
I'm the one who wants to change things, the protagonists of that change agent, is not waiting for someone to solve their lives.
And from my square meter being sympathetic, starting to emit.
Energy of optimism, because you know what with the people you put together, you contagiate.
And you're with a group of pessimist pieces, it's a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, you're a failure group, that's unhappy.
If you start your square meter, to contagiate solidarity, optimism, you begin to emit that energy, why?
What energy does your square meter have?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, for me, the important thing is that what we do, we do it with all the love of the world.
In Pasco, a ice cream was bought, it doesn't matter here to not be advertising.
And I say to the girl: "Felices Páscuas," and he tells me, 300 people went by and I was the first one that made me happy spaces.
And he said, "Go to the 300 happy people, Páscua."
No, I said.
What are you waiting for?
What are you emitting, your square meter, what a myth?
"What are you going to do?"
Have you seen the respect?
The respect emits encounter, emits gratitude.
Amone unconditional, what is he emitting, what he does, because we are a source of energy, and I remember what you put, it's what you receive.
This is like AMCM, if you're in AM and you're going from an AM point to the other end, you're going to listen to Radio AM.
Now, if you change your frequency and go to FM, there's another melody.
And it's more in the female, you have the long runs.
The frequency you want to hear can choose.
But if you're at the top, even if you go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that.
In other words, the world is how we create it.
They live in the paradise, but the hell is a decision, they start to say: "The first game match against me."
"Oh, I get up, I don't get up."
"Well, I'm getting up, I'm up with bad humor or a good humor."
Thank you.
It was a bad humor, or not, with a good humor.
I always disappointed badly, I see everything I have or see everything I need.
They are all decisions, all small differences: excellence, believe me, is this difference, the path you're going to grab is a Greek.
Since you get up.
Those victims and protagonists.
You're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come or make the interests that you're governing us and taking from domestic analysis.
People drive it for fear.
My father told me an enormous heritage, he always told me: "Please be afraid, I've never had it."
That's it.
Let's say, no, we are increasingly safer.
I'm going to tell you two life experiences.
With this foundation of albums and borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see it, I invite you.
To know what we did, they went to the past, we gathered the veterans of Argentinians and Vitanic War, came to a Marim British Royal and Kurkar.
And they gathered Argentine competers and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
And do you know who made the conference in my 12-year-old nephew, do you know what he said?
Ferra forbidden, which unity of measure is that.
They taught me that they were the bad guys, and now I see that bad guys suffered as good as well.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, it's 12 years old, it's born blind.
I invite you to see it, and I'm going to tell you two stories of life.
I had the blessing.
I went to live with the Foundation for street without Borders, it was 2012, I went to work so much gas, a conflict between realities and Palestine that took 70 years.
A place where I was witnessing, I thought I was missing a lot of things.
And I understood what?
All the time I was worried about what I was missing, and one morning I see that a lady from the city of Belén came and hugged with another lady and celebration, there's no celebration.
They are celebrating.
The translator tells me that they filled the water tank.
What does this mean?
And it has drinking water at home to take every week.
If you're celebrating it, their family and them will be able to name water.
They celebrated it, right?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy.
What do I ask him?
Do you know what the genius in the radian lamp is through the translator?
"And ...?"
I said, "No, I don't have any idea."
So I'm going to explain what that genius is in the lady's lady.
And I tell him, "I have a desire, what do you ask me?"
"I followed you, it deserves me all emotional."
Audience: Oh!
To give my hot water bathroom.
Like their great desire, right?
I'll tell you that moment.
All the time I was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had to think if I was going to have water to drink.
If he could give me a bathroom, he would have...
Where to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude.
I stopped being in the world of mind if I was in the world of the mountains and I realized everything I had, right?
And to conclude this, with this story I want to propose to you an exercise, all of you, in this state, that we are now.
It will have three steps in the exercise.
The first step.
I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
What if it were the eyes?
Imagine at this moment.
All the things we have, that we never give them.
Valor, we don't give them importance, as the fact of having a place where to sleep, to be able to bathe, to have water.
To start doing a mental list.
From the things we never realize and thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
It's like our senses, our friends.
What are these things?
That we give them by sitting, but never.
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with it.
With all the people in this room.
That at this moment they feel, what have they been?
What about it?
Welcome or selected?
Or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel a deep gratitude for the state of things they have done until now.
They express that gratitude.
Putting on foot, applauding the strongest thing you can shout doing what you want, in the gratitude you feel for the things you've received in your life, if you feel it right now.
From a moment on, I put myself and applause to my effort. (Applause) Well, and here, Barbaro, Barbaro, the abundance we have to express for the things we don't realize, because of what we have, very well above, can scream, can join the chairs that we can do in our lives, and in strong, with what we have, with what we receive.
And stay there for a moment.
The longest path to travel?
It's four palmates, when we manage to lower our heads.
We connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Everything we have, but everything we need.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
But I have to make a decision.
We managed to pay for a moment the turbine.
And now I'm going to ask you to speak right now.
What did we do with feeling and feeling?
And that every day of their lives, when they're going to swim.
A shower.
Do you remember what?
Is there a place in a world of a 10-year-old boy?
Is the genius of the radian lamp?
He asks him.
What you're going to start doing.
And from there they realize each other.
That we can choose the path where we are going to transit.
If we were going to go to hell or if we were going to go to the paradise.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Musicizing is to wake up the inner world and share it with others.
And we don't need to be an instrumentist or to be a musician to avoid music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us.
Since we are born in Latin.
In pulse, in rhythms.
The sun goes out in the Moon, my life!
But music also lives in pauses.
In silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language.
That integrates worlds, since we are little, and we play with the sound as if they were toys, "Daddy Pach!
Until we grow and take music with us.
And also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go together and grow in community.
Music.
Genera rituals to accompany everyday life.
so that we can give us welcome, say goodbye to ourselves.
Mediant, games and songs.
Welcome!
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Music)
(Applause)
Believe me, it's not easy.
Let's stop calling.
Imagine then what Bullying must be.
bullying, physical or verbal aggressions.
What does school usually happen for that too?
How can I choose?
It's one of the most discussed and serious problems of recent times, social problems.
However, it's been five or ten years ago.
I think few are none of us who have heard this word, bullying.
Although I also usually say that this is nothing new.
No, what is it?
It's always happened.
In fact, beyond the age we have, we all have some experience with this kind of situations, that is already why.
We live in our own meat.
Or why?
We contribute to managing it against our own classmates, our poor classmates, then in childhood.
Or because we simply appreciated it before it was called...
To take somebody's point to get bored.
Now, this is bullying.
Well, but I think this happens now and that we call bullying is actually something new.
You have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
There are many reasons.
First, before we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
Notice, they didn't discuss it in the media, they didn't try to promote laws to coexist it or to penalize it.
Of course it could be a reason for many people and, in fact, it was.
But it was thought it was something more or less normal.
Is it an indescribed consequence, a lateral effect?
Or the indeseated side of the school coexistence?
But it's not so serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, and it's that at that same time, that is, it doesn't happen.
Other school grams.
It would be much more serious.
Happy without importance that occurred in the recreations and in the halls.
I'm talking about the demonstrations, the exclusions, even the bad grades.
Therefore, children, like teachers, parents and society, thought that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now the opposite tends to do the opposite, right?
The bad grades and disciplinary reprimutes seem to be increasingly more serious.
Less serious, sorry.
And this new bullying phenomenon occupies a more central role.
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time, not on one side.
These are the most motivations.
Raditional humiliations of school.
They are the weddings applied by authority, like a teacher.
Or a directive?
Students wanted something considered incorrect.
Something forbidden by the regulations or something considered that it shouldn't be done.
How to behave bad or not study?
On the one hand, that loses weight.
On the other hand, they earn priority, new ones.
The reasons of school humiliation, which are these castings.
Because the same students apply between themselves.
With the most diverse reasons, but almost always related to the physical aspect or the personality of the victim.
Well, if this is happening, the question would be: Why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a great historical change.
A great historical change that was the only one to think.
Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional conflicts.
We have demonstrations, exulsions, bad grades.
What operates there is guilt.
Don't worry about having done something bad, something bad.
Culp is an internal, private emotion.
It refers to a moral conflict, a drama of each one with themselves.
That's why I've done something not only the regulations.
It's forbidden that it shouldn't be because it's unpleasant.
But everyone think that's wrong.
That's me.
I feel guilty because I did something bad.
(Laughter) Now, in the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's in play.
But another type of emotion.
The shame.
Because it's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
embarrassment is a public emotion.
It's not referred to a drama, private one for themselves, to have done something bad, something bad.
In the case of embarrassment.
The problem is not me.
But not the others.
Also.
The look of others, right?
That judges me.
It has been an incorrect, unfair way, sometimes cruel.
Besides having the fault or not having done something bad, in general, I don't have anything fault, it's the others who exercise my cruel look.
So?
It's a transformation, and I think this balance transformation happens to be more important than guilt.
And I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because it seems to me that the gene look, the look of the other.
Obviously, it was always important.
Lastly, he won a heavy weight, shaped, maybe.
And above all, at the moment of judging who each one is and how much it is.
And this wasn't always like that.
That's why I say it's a great historical change.
And of course, it's a very complex change, which is not from now on, that is managing, decades ago.
And it's like finishing to get used now, it's crystallizing now.
And I think it's one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the idea of internality.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a belief.
It's fundamental.
For the 200 years they preceded us?
In the 21st century I did 9:20pm.
"Yeah!
The conviction that life existed before.
No, something essential, but invisible to the eyes.
He believed he defined each one in a much deeper and true way.
What are the good appearances?
Those appearances?
They were not only considered bananas.
But also false, dangerous.
Like something smaller, something without importance, compared to all contundence.
That truth or inner beauty.
(Laughter) Well, I think this is all.
They are values and beliefs that still remain among us, but what?
We are abandoning them.
It's so true.
Transforming, we are abandoning these beliefs.
For example, in the case of the apparences, it seems quite clear to me.
They are so many.
Let's think of the whole body phenomenon developed in the last decades.
The importance of personal image, the physical aspect, the subject of gymnasium, the aesthetic treatments, all that.
It also matters a lot, and every time it's easier, it's what you see.
And you lose that notion that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But they are not the tribes that are inside each one, but that are not the triple, but something immaterial.
Like the soul or the spirit.
I thought we're less extreme in this.
And more and more, in what others can see.
What we show is what we do.
And according to these transformations.
The others judge us from what they see.
And less from that notion that there is something inside, innerity, eternal, half victory, antiquated, that would be more true than ox.
Together with this.
They appear in a series of traditions.
And one of them would be self-promotion.
How are the technical auto-production techniques?
Today they are everywhere.
So, until recently, something misunderstanding would be considered.
No, but let's think like an example.
I achieved the obsession to conquer the largest number of followers or likes.
Isn't it?
This is also to prove that someone who exists and has value and that deserves to be looked at.
All the social networks phenomenon could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set, an infinity of symptoms.
It's less contemporary, since they go from the tattoos.
Until plastic surgeries.
What's happening through the reality of shows?
And for bullying.
I think that thinking about this broader context doesn't surprise that bullying has become something so serious today.
It's so serious.
When amonestations and bad grades?
They are increasingly less serious.
Because it seems that guilt.
He lost a good part of his moralizing efficacy.
In other words, the fault is no longer so effective.
Like embarrassment.
To produce effects in our lives.
And this is very complicated because it demands a management, a administration.
It's from two.
There are people who look like contradictory on one side.
Do we have to expose ourselves?
We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are.
And what do we do?
So we have to grow and spread our image.
But on the other hand, risk is always there.
Of that it's full look.
Tone returns to admiration.
Yes, no rejection, butterfly.
Ignorance that also ignore us.
So we don't become more vulnerable to the gene look, for that same reason.
Let's also think about the complication " cyberbullying" when these bubbles...
Or disseminations?
They are disseminated by networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc.
So what I used to do before was to be private, to limit the group of acquaintances or...
I've lived through the walls of the school or the house, suddenly.
It moves to millions of people, everyone knows it.
So embarrassment becomes terrible, much more serious.
"Yes."
We don't have where to take refuge.
Honey inside of yourself.
I had the intimacy, not even dreaming of escaping a deserted island.
And every time.
That's less, or there's no more, at least no Wi-Fi, which is the subject.
So, it seems that this idea that hell is us.
It has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection.
And of the profiles, always visible, in thousands of screens.
And with this dependence we develop.
With respect to the button, I like it.
"No, this is click, marriage."
What do we expect everything to consider us before any selfie or whatever we have?
Well, this is happening, in fact, this historical change.
With these consequences and effects, the question would be...
"What's my name?"
Also, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad.
How do we solve it?
Well, the bad news is that I don't have a solution.
But I think I have some clues.
Does it seem so much guilt, like shame?
They are social control mechanisms.
And the fact that the fault is losing a good part of its rigor, now.
That embarrassment is magnificating.
This is not good or bad in itself.
But it's something we have to have in mind.
You're a data.
Because if we continue, that things changed in fact, right?
So, if we keep thinking.
And what happens now is the same that happened before.
And we try to solve it as if it were the same.
But probably we won't be very far.
That's what he wanted to tell.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Cheers) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause) Today we talk to my children at home, and I tell you we were living a historical moment.
That we weren't going to forget these days.
He let me tell me.
Mamma, I want to live in a historical moment.
But the good ones.
I work to investigate its education and I feel that the pandemic puts us to the force, in a kind of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting.
To explore, what happens?
In a hyper-connected world where we can't go to physical school.
And in these days I'm thinking a lot about that.
Is there something we can learn?
This educational scenario we don't choose.
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
I would like to share with you these ideas that are walking around me.
In these days and I hope, in one of those...
They are not part of the education of here in front of us.
The first time, all of us and all of us, together teachers, have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Innovation is something that comes to talk about closing.
But until now they were happening isolately, separated.
And one day for another, we all, in simultaneously, had to help us give a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency.
Those who dedicate us to teaching are having to redesign our classes at a distance.
And in that process ...
We are encouraging ourselves to fail new ways to do things.
And for that, we realized there was no way.
I think we had never had until now to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available.
The urgency, the inner, needs to use.
Storial videos, books in line, remote learning platforms.
social networks, emails, video calls.
What I know is that it will give them the result to keep teaching.
And especially to be connected with students, with families.
That these days are, but so important.
And the good news, in the middle of all this, I think.
Once we try them, we use them.
These strategies already start to be samples.
They start to be part of what we know how to do.
It's our tool box.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration it brings.
To have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to determine patients and do the same when things don't go out too, because we are also learning.
What are we going to grab the taste?
To try new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching the girl what they know from yoga lessons.
Until the workshop I chose.
Even people with vocation of teaching are encouraging healthy, as they don't know if they come in these days, they've been taught bigger than them.
We started to show how the compound is.
For that, bank tricks, those people of their age.
We are learning the community.
The second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In a research we did last year we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school.
Like something that appeared once and again.
The kids and girls always told us that the school they dreamed was...
I had...
A space, at least in part.
To choose what to learn?
And when and how?
And suddenly, and one day for another, that's happening.
In these days, many families realized that many times kids, especially when they are teenagers.
They learn better when they manage to organize their own times.
Some were more at night.
Others start with the subjects that interest us the most.
Others connect with the classmates to make the task, or a change in the web, to try to understand something that doesn't come out.
Or to learn the new ones who had desire.
This also helps us think about the education of here, in front of us.
Because it makes us see that these autonomy moments of children.
You can combine with other distances in which we are all together working on the wall.
And it also tells us that for all kids and girls to take advantage of those more autonomous moments, we have to teach them.
From a thousand little kits.
To organize their times.
Mak your tasks and everything you want to learn to learn.
And my last reflection ...
It comes to me a question.
What happens when it happens?
In these days?
We don't have the physical school as a place to go.
The quarantine is achieving that we realize, but not in a theoretical, clear way, but in the body.
The value of school and the enormous task they are doing and they do every day the teachers.
When kids and girls can't go to school.
It seems stronger than ever, it's a society as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children in school tasks.
It's as if it's happening these days.
We realize it.
But it's difficult to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is being more visible than ever the differences between the home.
It's not only the one with a computer and the one who doesn't, the one with the Internet, the one who doesn't.
It's the one who has a calm place to study and the one who doesn't.
And who has here to ask, and the one who doesn't.
The one who has to do all care tasks at home.
And the one who doesn't.
The school.
With all their difficulties, for a single day, at least.
They put between parenthesis, inequalities and help all children and girls.
They are protected.
And with focus, of course.
And learning.
As an educator, it worries a lot how all this will be.
And I also wonder what will be left of what we are learning in this quarantine.
My feeling in these days is ...
Have you seen when the sea breaks and stays in the cloud beach?
Between all that weird and yellow.
But what's wrong?
What is carried out.
Also on the beach some treasures that were hidden.
I wish even though, as my son said.
This historical moment is not for anything good.
It helps us do own.
Those treasures we are finding.
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
Let's replicate the use of time and learn and also.
Do we realize how much we need as a society?
From school and teachers.
Hello.
Physics are closed.
In one of those, I opened a door to keep building.
Between all.
When all this happens.
It's an education we dream.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too two months and that suddenly...
We used to live like this.
That the banks improved in the jungle and that everything could be paid for the phone.
That the trucks with food and houses and medicines travelled by the road against remote.
They are conducted by trucks in chaos or a chair.
From her house.
That doctors operated by medicine, the patient at home.
The doctor in the suit is Rayo-Sex, the kitchen and good nights.
That the education at a distance worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up to 7M to study a bit asleep.
I dreamed that the workers of the State understood, finally, the functioning of Google Drail, finally.
That the drivers learned to be cyberattacks.
That the mythomans and the chisms.
They were bouncing into the diffusion of conspiranous news through social media.
And that those who before buying funds, pans, engineers.
They shared those lies with their friends.
That all businesses worked for displayment and dream.
That it could be voted from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week it could be voted from home, abortion or abortion, we didn't appreciate a button.
Marigona Libres did, or marked the book "No, we appreciated a button," we all said what seemed to us and then won the majority of one day for the other, quickly.
Without sceners, northern or scatoric disputes, deciding the place of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also online.
The tablets gave them the cure for YouTube.
And of course, it was forbidden to emit them.
Or "I don't want it."
I dreamed that an algorithm was replaced by lawyers and judges.
And that one day for the other, all those who ever studied law...
They had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world.
Through Google EAT.
And that, in the end?
We got used to buying the businesses of the neighborhood.
And that we did the line in the street, already automatically by Augusto, always keeping a meter and a half distance with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbour we greet them from far away.
With codo.
I dreamed that we became monogamous, but really.
And that the single people were looking for a love in the neighborhood and they started to live because the same as before.
Or we hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that the soldiers who didn't want to live with anyone respected us because we realized that they thought all day in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that the addicts had been recovered.
Or that they made habits to something else.
I dreamed that TED talks had to do them from home and do them from home.
And that they no longer lasted 18 minutes, but they lasted 6.
I dreamed that the State sent us a 3D printer to each one, to be able to buy important products.
I dreamed that at night, in the big cities.
They came back to see stars.
They were dots like in the field.
And that in the field...
They proliferated, suddenly, wild horse and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day ...
Many months later.
The government denounced the end of the pandemic.
And in a very communicated court, the president told the town that it was possible to leave the street.
That it could be normal life, leave as if the president occupies their jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later.
I dreamed that a avestruz crossed the nine of July.
And that we all went out as crazy at the street.
And we ran to the avestruz.
To make us a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting.
We fixed it.
And we killed it.
And that a truck is intriguing.
I cried against the drawer of the avestruz and returned.
And they fell from the truck filled with wine cardboard.
And that there were more people at home.
At the street.
To take selfies with dead avestruz and steal the wine.
And there were screams.
And then someone punished the other and the journalists appeared that were removed.
To transmit the massacre in vivo, and then I woke up, I woke up.
And I discovered that we kept in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
It's not something that when you see a picture.
Sometimes there are people who are a little more beautiful, but who appear a little more ugly in the picture, or people who are a little more ugly in the picture and who look more beautiful.
(Laughter)
That fact caught my attention a lot, because if you think that photogenics exists.
It means that photography can't end with the living portrait, it can't move it.
So, a few years ago, I started actively.
To draw.
To give you the idea of what?
When you draw, you draw.
What you think is seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So I embraced that challenge of seeing with detachment.
To indagate the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimology of what you are capturing.
No, and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go from walk or visit a place with little friends on Facebook, that we draw.
And we use it as a lab.
And we realized that a line is a place that came out of a walk.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible.
We have to look at it with detachment visible.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom, "How much do you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in only 30 seconds?"
"That's funk," he told me.
And that's how I felt that party and I suggested to prove it.
If I got to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds?
I would eat the last or a half with a cream that was left in the beach.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went direct to Instagram.
I wrote a letter from chance and entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until I started to see everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, more or less a month ago, had climbed a photo with the beautiful number 18.
There were a lot of people, family, friend, Gachi Pachi, all singing the complete happy.
So I suppose it was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some art pieces and banks, and I said, "This girl likes art."
Something that later could confirm with some photos she seemed to paint.
That's why I kept going down and I discovered.
That who is, obviously, was his best friend before.
What is a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design?
And among all that, I could also see that it's a very healthy person who attacks the milk and covers it, that is, very respectful to the environment.
But for these ten things, 28 seconds had gone.
My mom was very shocked.
I couldn't believe I could know a person like this from social networks.
It's true that in networks each one chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way to know other people comparing how we did it a few years ago.
Before, everything I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To give you a general idea, that person has to know details.
Today, thanks to social networks, that's to say that this became completely transformed and it's the opposite.
And something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can know first details of the person, their personality, their tastes, their families, their friends.
And then, with all that, we make a general image of the person.
Understanding so, what's more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant.
A multicultural and has a lot of social and environmental concern.
This is much more powered in social media.
An example is like with the girl I found in Instagram.
I didn't judge her to be trans.
That didn't work as a barrier so that I wanted to know it.
Or why do they choose to show their reality?
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see on the other helps me question what I'm seeing in the world.
After doing this kind of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications called my attention, like the ones I spoke about, to take care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself, "What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it?"
And if that's how I'm going to do it.
While I spoke to my mom and I was very funny with a crime.
We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds are transferred to our daily encounters.
And that's when I realized that this way is so different to know others, what are social networks?
She went through the screens and she is present in my daily encounters.
My behavior in the real world, that's how to say it, changed completely.
To find myself with a person I don't know, I don't see any label to frame it.
I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those of those I mentioned at the beginning.
I ask everything and without judging.
(Applause) And, obviously, I ask her to use the networks, thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
But it's not that the attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face think?
What are you looking at?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first, what comes afterwards.
Surely everyone will have happened at some point.
The eyes.
For different parts of the face.
Have you ever had anywhere?
Effectively.
Some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci.
Did you know that the eyes weren't the only relevant element to build?
The look of a portrait.
But also.
The ships, the commissors of the mouth, the edges of the ears.
It uses pores and details.
They were fundamental elements to constitute what we would call.
The look of the portrait.
It was as if, somehow, these affections knew.
Happy.
They were the parts of the face that the spectators looked for.
To elaborate a portrait, to put evidence in subjectivity through the constitution of a look.
And at the same time, she is looking for her.
The other one, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought about it.
What would it be if we can see how a spectator looks at?
In a positioning team, in a neuroscience lab, we put several portraits.
For many people.
And we register the movement of the eyes.
In front of that image.
What we get.
It's how we build the image in time.
"How?"
Our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face.
To extract information, since the rest...
It constitutes the brain.
And if we do all the images together?
Looks together in the image, we could see what relevant parts.
They are at the time of building.
The portrait, and what is it not?
In some way, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that look, of the portrait, that we talk recently.
And the look of the spectators.
What if it happened to us to think then?
How would it be a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks all together?
The look of others.
We got it.
Of course, today I'm showing you and I want to share with you.
This very previous trial for the record of an eye.
It's... I have to love an abstract.
From some of the projects that took together with Mariano Sigman.
In the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think in some way as a trip.
A trip through different landscapes.
October.
Guyomes.
In which we transit with some maps of art and several leaves of route of science, but that is fundamentally.
What encourages us.
The search of the stadium.
Interrogants?
And the expectation.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Audience) Hi!
(Music) (Applause)
At the exact moment we are born.
We started to age.
The aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However?
It's the most resistant.
We invested so many resources to live more and more years?
And even so?
It seems it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
And why?
A few years ago.
When I started working in longevity issues.
Many people asked me.
What is your voice so young, taking care of old people?
It's my future, I answered it.
Who knows how to live many years and so I'm going.
What they didn't say at that moment.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old.
"No."
Fear?
To live in a society?
Where the most important thing is.
Is it being?
Or to be a young man.
Fear?
To make my knowledge and experience.
They are losing value.
That my word ...
It wasn't taken into account.
Fear.
To stay in the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
The discrimination for age is the most extended in the world.
And the older women?
Those who suffer the most.
Besides.
The linked stereotypes continue to be socially accepted.
We can see them.
In advertisements, in workplaces.
In the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
It's that many times.
We don't perceive them.
Or we let them happen.
These stereotypes fit older people.
Let's see some generalizations that all put in the same bag.
For example, is this common idea that older people?
Are they sick or depend on others?
When data of the male debt of social debt tells us that 70 percent of older people today in Argentina.
They are self-valid.
Is it to say that you can take care of yourself?
And take care of others.
Or this shared belief?
that the elderly are sad or depressed.
Because of 80 percent.
It says to be happy.
And that is much more than what people manifest in my age or even younger.
Or this passive class label?
A passive class.
Who just looks like that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many older people who are working today, creating.
Are they doing sports participating in volunteers?
By taking care of others.
stereotypes are very powerful and they have a huge impact on people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying forward a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know?
The difficult thing it is for a person.
From 65 more?
To get a credit or a funding for their project?
Even when it's shown.
That projects where older people have more successful probabilities.
However.
I never found.
Neither a scholarship.
And a call.
Not an opportunity for funding.
That includes them.
Another example: the empty that exist in the health field.
In the majority of public universities in our country?
There is no geriatry matter.
Medicine students are formed to treat young adults.
Not older.
Everything related to aging is just a topic.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity we suffer to get?
Or what's happening with university teachers in any field?
That in the 70s they are invited to get rid of data issues.
Who defines that chronological limit?
This is from 69 to 69.
You can give classes.
And in 71 no.
Communication media are not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, in a meeting with a national media, I asked them.
Why did every time they treated older people, they used the same photo?
That ...
From the older person, in a plasma bank, giving them to eat the 'Palomas'.
Do you locate it?
It's the only thing we have in archive, it was the answer.
The press breaks, it has old age.
That, in addition to images, we lack words.
Adults older.
Third age.
Travels.
My parents are the traps.
Girls.
The elderly.
I still don't find a word.
That identifies or conforms to everyone.
Is it the only thing I suggest to avoid?
Is it grandfather or grandmother?
It's something their grandchildren are, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But if it's for affection?
I could tell myself "mamita," because it's a woman in reproductive age.
And it doesn't correspond.
The older people.
They have a name.
It's like everyone.
Stereotypes...
They hurt them.
They grow.
And they become invisible to many.
Today, in Argentina.
There are 6 million older people of 60 years.
In 2050, there will be more than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
Are we already?
An aggressive society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither to join us.
If we joined, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate?
To create jobs.
To design new products and services.
This new longevity.
There are endless doors for us to rethink the next years in the economic, in social and cultural.
I'm going to give you an example.
In this country.
One out of three older people says that it's a need for recreation and entertainment, they're little or not satisfied.
Or that if they had the opportunity, they would keep studying and forming themselves.
However?
Education proposals that exist.
They are almost exclusively thinking.
For children and young people.
All these opportunities we can't detect them intuitively.
Because the elderly.
I'm a very different group.
That she doesn't reply to traditional patterns that we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal.
Is it that we listen and learn from older people?
To really understand?
What are their new needs?
His new possibilities?
Deceos.
And you like it.
A while ago, interviewing a older person.
I wasn't clear if I wanted to be activities with people of their age or with more young people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life.
It has its potential.
To discover it.
We have to add our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Because old.
They are not the others.
Children.
We are us and those we are going to do.
Thank you. (Applause)
