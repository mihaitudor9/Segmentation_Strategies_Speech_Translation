We are Chinese, we do calculating the Argentinian Chinese Chinese Chinese trail, there are legs and orchestra music that we call from the one who is seen in the area. But we had a vision. To make the violin and the instrument we go, protagonists. In our popular music, for this we change the way we touch it, in a way that sounds flower, and it can dance, look at the radio and live there. Mauro lives in Buenos Aires, and I start that we had to learn how to work. So we call each one for video, each one records their part. So the other can play on top and so we're going to save the repertoire. (Audience) Yes! So let's see that we don't even have their suffering. BB: So, it hurts me. And the family is the ones who won't recover. What are you seeing? (Audience) The show, right? (Audience talking) They say goodbye. But there's something new in this pandemic, something that we dedicate ourselves to checking the contents of social networks and fighting for that information, we were already seeing it. And don't worry about this new idea. During the pandemic, the fluid. In 2009, there was already Twitter, Facebook and Youtube, but its consumption of global supertraction was much lower. The pandemic, at the 19th century, is the first pandemic that coexists with misfortune. And what is empowerment? The OMS, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice of spreading false and malicious news about pandemic. It's called "Terda," because it generates panic and anxiety of people. Disinformation is always dangerous, we know it, but when it refers to health issues, what can affect because what can put in danger is directly our lives. Or maybe if you have an idea, you don't know anything about an idea and, of course, a WhatsApp, in Youtube, in Twitter, of the amount of waste that circulates the viralization of unbearable contents. For four weeks, with my team. But we work. Without rest, checking, fools, truths, media that circulate on this new disease: false content. I know we know and we are aware that they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible, and sometimes they are frustrated. That's why I think it's subtle that tells you what we discover, something we find. All the contents. Pictured at COVID-19: they can fit. Or classifying in four categories, I think telling you later you will be more prepared. And being more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this avalanche of information that can't go on top. The four categories are simple: The first has to do with connected content to the origin of the disease. Theories that say that if you see contained an act of pioneer of two Chinese scientists robots, the Canadá, until a English lab created this virus, I don't take it in Syrian, discarte it, there's no evidence of that. The second category is related to how the virus replies, and some media published, that we were going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not like that, there is no evidence of that. The third category is the one that is related to false treatments and colors, it's the most dangerous, it's the one that has to put us more attentive, the ones that have to force us to be more careful. It's not true that there's already the vaccine that we take hot water with lemon, we kill albums, and that by making us garage with warm water, or making vapor, it's a way to disappear from our body if we are infected, but at the moment, it doesn't have a completely satisfactory answer. The fourth category of information is related to false measures, but the farther in Argentina, the day it was disappointed, the preventive and obligatory isolation, 15 days ago, a little more, a false secret circulated that said that the quarantine started at 3 pm of that day, and obviously generated a lot of chaos. There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent it will happen, but they do it without context. Or others, with those who perhaps cross you, who say that it's going to be online, not only in Argentina, but in the whole world, and so it makes us fear that we won't only have to be locked in our homes, but in communicated. In general, misinformation seeks to generate panic and anxiety, that's why it's important that if you receive some of these contents that enter some of these four boxes and don't come from a official source, like the World Health Organization or the health Ministry, distrust. Before finishing, I want to tell you something else we learned, the ones we dedicate ourselves, to checking, checking. What is it? We are not good. What a doubt? We are not comfortable when we are missing to be thesis. And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty, without all the care we should have. I want to ask you a favor. If you receive a content, it's not checking, you don't share it, let's replace the sharing of doubts as usual. That's it! I don't share doubts. And that's what we take care of. If I received a content. You don't have boxes, eat ice, someone, and you discover that false, confirmation and affection. And if you really share a content and then realize that false doesn't fall. Disculpate and correct. That's not about tons, but of living. The dynamic pandemic tells us affectionists, sanitarists, employees all the time, there are changes every day, science works intensely to get the cure and needs time, there are empty evidence and information. We have to be able to be able to tolerate that uncertainty. I don't remember another moment in the modern era, in which the answers of tolerating our ignorance and the certainties we needed as much as now, but I'm sure, because we are not able to tolerate them. NJ: No. 23 years ago I dedicated myself to accompanying people in the last moments of their lives. And in these years I learned many things, some of which I would like to share with you today. I learned to work in the middle of pain of other people. Don't make you a person or bitter, sad, all the opposite, teaches you to appreciate every moment of your existence and be grateful for everything you have. I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be, if not being able to see a miracle in an act of reconciliation. Sorry, love or transformation. I learned that the sense of humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to make a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generate the close presence of death. When, despite having done all the doctors, we have to work much more, our omnipotenty, to be more united, and not to feel frustrated or failed, the result is not the one who expected. I learned that when we are going through difficult times, it's good to look. And there are many people. That they are suffering and in much more adverse conditions than ours. And that allows you to put your own perspective. Finally, I learned and still learn. That it's not just about cure. Especially, it's about relating and accompanying. To grow, love and compassion help to face suffering. And they can be a legacy for the family. To grow, love and compassion can stop. A path of transcendence so that others can transit. That's it? Thank you very much. I've spent 40 years. After writing several novels, I wanted to write about more personal topics. I took my pluma and after several pages. I realized that I was going to be inevitable to talk about my female condition, of my women's condition. Because when a man is asked, is it enough for him to decide? Good evening, you're Mr. Durant, you're a writer. For a woman like me, I have to decide good evening, I'm a writer. And I'm a woman. Why would we have to introduce ourselves like that? I had a lot to start my research about feminine condition. IWR: It was a pretty written topic in many articles. The feminity is losing, the feminity will disappear. The topic becomes fast, especially for women. But in the end, what is feminity? Can we wake up? Approximately that half of humanity is masculinity and the other half is feminity, so why do we ask ourselves to be more women? Would there be a mold to be a woman? At 30 years old, would you have told me that I would write a book about female condition? I would have surprised myself, maybe angry, at 40. I'm enjoying it a lot, it's such an obvious topic, but at the same time they're ignored. AC: And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations to a man. It's enough to get into the street to see that humanity is divided in two groups that walk differently, that are seen differently. And that they speak differently. I started my research recording all the beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist on women in our society. But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete. If it wasn't going to look for the causes of these myths. Studying is more biological. Physiological? Psychologists, technological? I hadn't occurred to any man to analyze the peculiar condition of man in society. The singularity of man. That it doesn't have a case, the shadow is everything in the majority of the languages, the man is both the positive and the neutral side, the man is humanity. The man is everything, it's the main, it's the essential. Women are the other, the other. There are women. AD: The second sex. The second sex. Women are not essential. And it didn't define itself. They define themselves in reciprocity to the man who is everything. So I followed my research. And I realized that in the history of civilization many times they create excluded groups. Excluded as blacks, excluded as the properties or the Jews. But among them there is a community, they say: "We identify ourselves." However, women. I don't identify so easily among them, they don't say us. In fact, a white woman will be more easily identified with a white man than with a black woman. A bubble woman. Would you easily identify with a shadow name? So, with a prosecutor. Women don't create community. Women don't say "no". Because they live dispersed inside the group of men. I asked her. At the chest, it was quite satisfied to believe and feel the king of creation. Until anti-feminists looked for theories in the religion, in the theory, in biology. To explain the inferiority of women. In philosophical discussion. Several men usually interpel me to tell me, "You're a doll because it's a woman." Of course, as if I had several and a uterus, and the rule and hormones would take me any objectivity. Well, as if they wrote their theories. AC: They didn't have their hormones and their therone texts showing them what to think. So, what do I want? It's to be aware of these differences and understand them, to share what I understood. I shared what I understood because women behave different from men. And within everything I told you, what I studied about biology and physiology, etc. Let me tell you one thing. That women's behavior hasn't been erased by their nature. It's not for culture. Nature is that. It doesn't walk all society, it's the culture that explains how we are interacting in our society. Well, in other terms. KA: It's not born a woman. It's yoga to do it. I was quite privileged. When I published my first novel, I was recognized immediately as a writer. And at the same time it was recognized as a woman. So, I didn't suffer my feminity. I had the best of the worlds: an integral and integral individual. Many women stay in their feminine because man explains it's very natural for her. And to get married. Returning is the slave of possessions. To have children is dedicated to creating them. Men explain that it's very natural for all that. His feminity is summarized to that. I don't want to change feminine condition. For that, it's a lot. What I do want to do. It's conscious. Knowing about these differences. And to feel that you can make decisions. GG: With a book, a TED. What I want to share. It's that each woman and every man. (End of video) It can and must decide what they want for their sexuality. Especially what they dream of doing their family. Each woman, every man. Who has to define what he wants to do in work if he wants or not to work? With free choice, free will. Well, what I want is to become aware. That this is effort. It has to be done together between men and women, what I want is to be aware of. That's when the second is sex. It will have answered these questions, and it will be living them. So, we will live in a complete, powerful society. made of men and women completely complete and free. Thank you, thank you. (Applause) Good afternoon, I guess you've studied for today, do you surely know the thinking that it's a hymno? In search of freedom, a book that talks about thoughts, that thoughts go, like the golden waves on mountains and hills. And, in the end, he says, "If this thinking is given to suffering, value." And it's something that wrote it "Verdi" and "Open to look for more than 100 years ago" and we can take it as own. Also, right? (Laughter) Now breathe, surely they've been breathing at home. (Laughter) Because we know them, now we're going to respect specifically to sing this, let's go with the court? Karina. Wow! Wow! [A.DE.] One, two, three, four! According to a couple of years ago, a group of friends in my school was going to go out to mark for the legalization of the abortion. I asked my mom if I could with them. And my mom told me no, that in any way it was very young to be alone, that I was afraid of what could happen. And then I told him, "Great! If you don't have the desire you go with them, accompany me. And my mom, who didn't steal a mark from the time of the Fonzini. (Laughter) I still remember his face when we arrived, came with me to Congress. He looked around and said to me with a smile and a lot of surprise: "Wow, it's full of kids!" (Laughter) Actually, we were almost all girls, but well, things are equal to understand each other, right? This, for my mom, was so surprising and unexpected, is something that today is super natural to me: to talk about politics, to say what I think, to go out to mark for what I think is fair. They are things I do a lot. I think it has to do with that I grew up with a almost strict diet of books and movies about teenagers that changed the world. Jarry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, generous chronics. They are the stories of my generation. In all villages they express, that described the rest they say to be more. And in all, there are teenagers, kids like me. That they get up and fight to build something more open and free. So, it doesn't surprise me at all, the attitude I see many teenagers regarding politics. Even sometimes it seems that another option doesn't leave us. Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you're living in a distopy, which is a dark and indeciable world like the one of those books. And we have to fight to change that. And then they put us head in a closing distopy, like climate change, where we are the youths who are going to pay the account. Sometimes I look around and I feel we are living in one of those books. But where there are one of those distopies, they also have to be those protagonists who reveal themselves, right? In any place where a death flight has to do with Harry, and, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni. For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life, on the contrary, I think it's present in all our lives' lives, in the culture we consume, in the stories we count, in what we think is good or bad for me, has a political dimension. It happens to me that sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me by calling people who make xenophobos comments or discussing about political things. (Laughter) And while many people prefer to avoid these topics, to not generate fight, their uncomfortable situations. But I suppose there are certain things that are worth fighting for. And discussing with someone for their political position is not the same as fighting because I'm a mouth and a River's voice, that, in the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't appear, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance. What we think politically makes us as people. (Laughter) That's why if a family member does a machist comment, I'm going to discuss it. If I have a friend who is against the egalitarian marriage or the abortion law, I don't avoid the subject to maintain peace. I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her without embarrassment. And when we talk about a close relationship with someone, I think of these things. Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about the other and how it deserves to be treated, because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me. When many say better to fall down. I do, even if it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it gives us a lot of fear, because only talking can be built our future and finding teenagers. And that you can look at yourself with pride and say, without any surprise, it's full of kids, thank you very much. Can you imagine having to walk for hours every day, taking a valley like this, to take water to your house? Can you imagine that the water that was inside was contaminated? Did you have this color? But water crisis is a fact. It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face ourselves in the future. So they signed the vast majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended the day by global, climate, water, a couple of days in Morocco. Water is life. And if we wouldn't exist, in fact, human beings, we are composed by more than 65% of water. And despite that, each day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, manantial lakes, through agriculture, livestock, of our great companies, and even of our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it. This is not just a result in the appearance of diseases around the world, but the direct cause of death of a thousand children a day. There are 1,000 children a day. According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live in any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water. Well, from that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America. And if we think about it, it turns out that this continent counts with 35 percent of the water reserves in the whole world. And if we look at some cases in specifically, we will realize and going to the country, that, for example, Peru, for example, has at least 30% of the population without access to drinking water. And that if we climb a little higher to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, the gentleman Trump wants to build a wall that separates even to these two countries, almost 20 million people live without clean water every day. All these numbers, those looking back, made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with natural wealth is found in this situation? It's exactly this question that made four men from Zaraota leave it all. And we wanted balls and we got back again to take drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, from Mexico. Funding like this, from Guatemala Project. Let's give you a piece of caravan autocaravan, so that we call the white leg. And most importantly, let's take the chance of a huge desire to return to the world, the luck that we do have been, to have been born, we set up to the adventure. During the path we were going to find rural and rural communities that rarely have water at home. I was all there, I was able to rivers, potholes or commercials. To be able to see, but always with a common problem. (Laughter) The water has this pen. It's polluted. All these communities usually have three days to purify the cat: the pill, crying it or directly concrete, which, as you can see, suggests a huge waste for people who don't have art. Audience: Yes. There are money resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go look for the leg and then go to life. And we asked ourselves, "What can we do to help solve this problem?" - Yes. By leaving the base that we were not experts in the matter, we put our hands to the work, and after many weeks of research, we found a system. Findraction in brands that was perfectly adapted to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities. And I'm going to show you how it works. It's a filter that works practically like a color. (Laughter) Let's stop going crazy, clean water, retaining 99% of all these substances, the polluted water goes through the end, the greater water that with a molecule of love... (Laughter) And this retains all the health of it. It's health. It's a real system that is the most efficient to bring clean water to quality in an immediate way. (Video) Besides, it's a completely revolutionary system if we consider that it's only the European weight of water to make it work. Can you imagine the impact of these paintings in the life of all these people? I said, "Well, there you go. It's Leo's story, we want to tell you a story: Leocruz is a 21-year-old young man. which belongs to the 15th of October 15th in Guatemala. Leo had a dream: to study English. And ending being a teacher in his community, but unfortunately, both he, like all his people, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which you were doing 100 was very polluted by the skeptics around you. But what about our mark? And Leo was written in a English course. It's that you can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride it was to be able to see all those people in those communities. How did they spend big part of their resources? To be able to fulfill among other things their dreams. The truth is we don't have words to describe it well, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools. From now on, more than 15,000 people in Mexico or Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will have access to drinking water during around 10 years. And now, thinking about it, thinking about two years ago, when "Water van," "Pan Solar" was an idea, we realize a little about the dream we have in the opportunity to live, right? But in this dream? Now, we've never been alone, before leaving. More than 400 people? They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign which was destined 100 percent to the exclusive company of water filters. And nine months later. Fortunately, we don't count for thousands. Together, have we created a social movement? What has made the trip of these four friends an unstoppable face against water crisis? But it still stays a lot, there are still a lot to do, there are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help. Besides, the global crisis of water can be one of the risks of the biggest risks in the next 10 years, according to the world's economic forest, which is not what we say. So we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation? The reason to have reached this situation is not another that we have an information insufficient. In the West, we have created so many necessities that are all necessary, that sometimes we don't think about what we suffer in other people so that we completely satisfy all of them. And we, in this project, have seen it with our own eyes. We have lived it personally, we have developed a Mexico project for many months. Where we have seen how great embotellers were appropriating the manuals that supported the communities, so they were taking them out completely the access to water they had. What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those lands, the big oil producers, the big oil? So that we, all of us, can win the deposit of our vehicles. They are making communities have to display, what they are doing is to contaminate, it's to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or or spiders of the Amazon, we've been there and it's hallucinating, and in a future it's that disappears to their culture. But it's really incredible and living it hasn't left us. It has left us something open. It's really something that really seems and we really think it seems that it doesn't affect us any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems. And the world crisis of water. It's a reality that is not just that. It's a reality that affects the developing countries, the world crisis of water affects 12th November 2016. It's affecting us directly to everyone and each one feels in this room. But you don't need to go very far. What about California? With a world of technological development that is changing people to consume too much water. They are cutting them in their minister. FD: For several hours. In Spain. In Spain we also suffer drivers, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the most water cases in the future. But if we really want to produce a change, if we really want to impact on this planet? What we have to do, all of us, is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we have to do is to educate all our children, all our families, what are the problems and necessities really going to be sustainable. So, what we have to do is support local projects from our city that are trying to reduce water consumption. That little NGO that is trying to build poths in Guatemala to distort to these communities that, unfortunately, are still without drinking water. Because we don't try, among all, to exercise a bit of pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the path these big companies that, today, of course, are not doing things well. We really have to appreciate and value the incredible luck we have to reach our homes. Opening the glass of water and that always drops water, or is not like that. FD: Let's please let this resource hurt. It seems not to us, but believe me, it's not infinite, it's not infinite. We have to act, we have to trust both and act, and we have to do it already. Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act? And that's how we won't be able to get the change we want to see in the world. Luckily, there are many, many days to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact in the lives of others. This is our way of doing it. What's your life? "Wow, how nice it is for you." Keeping up so many expensive, attentive. I started the conference making a commitment with you: science determined that we are sources of energy and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotion. So I'm going to ask you what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, talking about the heart, if you open the heart, surely you can receive the 1% of what I'm going to say, if we're only trapped in a part, so that's my commitment, to start the conference that the emotion has a better power to the thought, it's stressed. Revolved, confused, aggressive, faced. A hot accident, well, in my conferences, I'm 30 or 40 possibilities that give me this kind of answer, you've seen the answers that just given me, and then there's another question. (Laughter) Someone in this room is happy, raise your hand those who are happy, huh? (Laughter) Those who are happy, raise your hand. I'm sure that if I give you 100 possibilities that tell me how society is today, none of you have told me happy or happy. You are: What are we, where is society? When we talk about society, what we refer to, because here, 100% of the happy and happy societies, the answers that give, sometimes we go to the schools, we call the news of the day, the kids, and we tell them, "Give the good news, the bad and the rules, the money of the day, it's called everything we lack, everything we're missing, everything we're missing, one, two." Now, well, this is what happens to us when we naturally ask a impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with the sports that are fashionable, when I ask this, that says the future, the basket, the rack, the first national sport, the complaint. When they ask me how you are perfectly well, after we complain about the traffic, then we complain about my wife, and if we don't complain about something wrong, we complain about the weather, what cold does it do, three money, three of the afternoon, or what happened? DB: Oh, you don't have to complain anything! So we have transformed a society that is fun, it's like a title we have, that we complain about everything, we have a second national sport that has to do with the complaint. We waited for everything, I've already tried with my friends, it's a friend Fernando, who sweats his camera with him, and I tell him, "That's a disaster, you have to change this, my wife, all the time, we're complaining, so we transform ourselves in a complainologist, and the maximum, or Pinologist, and all of all the leaves, you know why it rained the leaves." You understand that the dollar is working there, well, we know everything, we think of the economy of politics, and something more worrying about it, or we have started to have our mind or enter the crisis, we complain, and we are immersed in the opinion, what makes us fall in a sort of vital stancing. You must come out of our house with the Cargado cell phone 100 percent and, in addition, we take a chargator for the doubts that doesn't have a lot of load, but with our energy, Lowat, we start the day. With a vital setting, with a chance of cancer. That, besides, it makes us lose power, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, that the country goes well, that the weather is not the same, because it's less beautiful and I came to give a conference and see with the remix and the remix says, "Yes, but tomorrow it's in a rain." This is how we're losing power, and there's something in this I want to focus, besides being in this society, especially in our generation, that we've left, associated with a moral crisis that, in addition to the most perversal mind of our grandparents, could be imagined, restricted, but in addition, we're doing this, but we make them believe this, how we represent this phrase and this quote. And what do you want, we are in Argentina? And we listened to this, and if it were worldwide levels, they thought, "What can we do?" But we only leave this society as it is, but that, in addition, we make people believe that they can't change it. A mistake, this is self-compliance. DB: Now, well. For a long time, I was there and I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I was formed that talent had to have talent, experience, and each one formed me more in this, but one day I discovered something wonderful, that all these things add, but the multiplied attitude, and you know that all the amount is zero, if you are a zero type zero. If you have that negative attitude, it's a negative guy, if you have that pessimistic attitude, or a pessimist guy, and if you have a sea attitude, it's a kind of merda. So I started to say, "Well, how can I go out of this position and the first thing I saw is that nothing changed, I had a decision to change the attitude and everything that happened to me, I had a decision to change that I wanted to see, to go out of the victim of all the time, to be justify, criticizing, to get out of this attitude. I was in January Island in the paradise, I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to decide to live in a different world because living in hell, this square meter, living in the energy I want to vibrate, it's a decision, because I have to complain everything I have in my life, I was very bad, where I start to complain everything I have to do, tomorrow I can return, I can return, to a decision, because I'm in my square. Because my square meter, as I want, and you know what you do, but it's also what you stop doing, if all the time we're going to be waiting for someone to change this. Well, I went to the student in my talk. So, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing. Not all have the same possibilities, we all have the same possibilities. I started educating, I thought there's a lot of way to educate, for me, a single one, with the example, every time we do something from our square meter, to emit energy, first, protagonist attitude, I'm the protagonist of my life. I'm the one who wants to change things, the protagonists of that kind of change is not waiting for someone to reassure their lives, and if you're with a group of pessimist pieces, it's a pessimist, if you're with a group of failures, you're a group of unhappy, if you start your square meter, or optimism, because what we do, we do with all the love of the love of the world. In Pasco I went to buy a ice cream, I didn't care what to not be advertising, and I said to the girl: "Pelices Páscuas, and they tell me, 300 people passed and I'm the first one that tells me happy is Páscua, what are you waiting for?" What are you emitting, your square meter keeps you, what do you do? Mite respect, I respect, emite encounter, emite gratitude, emite love unconditional, what you're emitting, what you do, because we're a source of energy, and I remember what you receive, this is like MMS, if you're in AM and you go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that. In other words, the world is, as we create it, they live in the paradise, but the hell is a decision, if I pull the morning and I start to say, "The first match plays against myself," "Well, I don't get up, I don't get up with bad humor or with a good humor." Well, with bad humor, or not with good humor, it's all the decisions, it's all small difference, excellence, the way you grab is a church, since you wake up, your victims or protagonists, you'll show what you want to build for the generations that come to do, I see everything I have, or I see everything that is missing, for fear. My father told me a huge sand, he always told me: "Please be afraid, I've never had it." Let's be safer, and I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this punishment of albums and borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see. To know what we did, the last week we gathered Beterans of Argentinians and British War, came to a Russian Marim British Russian and Kurkal, and they gathered Argentinian competers and, together, they had a message of encounter that nobody earned, and they know who closed the conference in my midnight is that. They taught me that they were the bad guys, and now I see that bad guys suffered as well as the good ones. A place where my attitude was of lack, I thought I was missing a lot of things, and I understood that all the time I was worried about what I lacked, and one morning I see that a lady Palestine was born of Belén, came and hugged with another lady and celebrated, I didn't have the vendition of living with the Foundation for those who took 70 years, so I said, "What are you celebrating?" So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank, that has drinking water at home to take every week. And if you're celebrating that, their family will be able to name water and celebrate them, right? And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy. I ask him, "Do you know what the radian genius is, through the translator, did you not have any idea?" So I'm going to explain what that genius is in the lamp of the lady. And I tell him, "I have a desire, what do I ask for?" I go on, I deserve everything, I don't know. "Oh, give my hot water bathroom." As a big CEO, and at that moment, I was connected to what I was missing, I realized that since I was born I had to think if I was going to have water to drink, if I could give a bathroom, I would have to sleep. So I lived in the same physical space with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude, I stopped being in the world of the lack, I was in the world of the abundance, and I realized everything I had, right? And to conclude this, with this story, I want to propose an exercise: all of you, in this state, that we are now. The first step will have three steps and exercise: I ask you to close your eyes, all of you, close your eyes, imagine yourself at this moment. We all have to start doing a mental list of the things we never realize and thank, like health, as the possibilities we have, how our senses, our friends, how many things we have. That we give them by sitting, but never. We list them. The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room who have been sold or selected, or chosen by everything they have, all the people who feel a deep gratitude for the state of things that have done until this moment, that expresses that gratitude. Putting on foot, applauding the strongest thing that can shout doing what they want, express the gratitude they feel for the things they have received in their lives, if they feel at this moment, from this moment, and applause for the strength. (Applause) You can scream, you can join the chairs, you can do what you want. We are in a society in a very good, very well-being moment, very well above, and above, this is the gratitude we have to express for everything we have. (Applause) Barba, Barba, logist, yeah! And what did I say there? And stay there for a moment. The longest path to travel? It's four palmates, when we manage to move from our heads, we connect with our heart or with our emotions. When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, everything we have, but a decision. And now I'm going to ask you to push this moment, we'll stop feeling this feeling and that each day of their lives, when they're going to give a shower. Do you remember there's a place in the world of a 10-year-old boy at the genius of the golden lamp? I ask you to start doing it. And from that moment on, they realize it. That we can choose the path where we are going to transit, if we were going to go to hell or if we were going to go to the paradise. Thank you very much. Musicizing is to wake up the inner world and share it with others, you know why, because music is already in us, since we are born in latest, in impulses, in rhythms. The sun goes out, the moon, my life. But music also lives in the pauses and being receptive: music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with the sound as if it were toys. Until we grow and take the music with us, and it also generates bridges between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go together and grow in community, so that we can give us the welcome to say goodbyees, games and songs. Welcome. Keep calm! Yeah! Clearly, it's not easy to face such a sea of people. Thank you. Imagine then what Bullying must be: bullying, physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as school support. (Laughter) One of the most discussed and serious problems of recent times, social problems, however, five or ten years ago, I think few of us have heard this word, "bullying". Although now the opposite tends to do the opposite, some even could think that this is nothing new, the bad grades and the disciplinary reforms, it seems that it's more serious, but it's not even more important that what we call bullying, but it's not so serious, but it's that it's also a very more traditional movement of humble humbling humbling humiliation, that it's not so much more important that it's not what happens now, and that it's not what happens now, and that we's what we's what we's nowadays, as we're called bullying, and that we're going on our own, and that we're all our own, we're going on our own with our own companions, we're going on our own companions, our own companions, our own companions, our own companions, our own companions, we're going on our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our parents, our parents, our parents, our parents, our parents, On the other hand, they earn priority, new ones. Motives of school humiliation, which are these castings that the same students apply between themselves for the most diverse reasons, but almost always related to the physical aspect or the personality of the victim. (Laughter) If this is happening, the question would be: Why is this transformation in our values? And I think it's a great historical change about which it's worth thinking. Because we think that on one hand, in those reasons of school humiliation, those most traditional conflicts, demonstrations, exulsions, bad grades, what operates there is guilt. Fulp for having done something bad, the fault is an internal emotion, private emotion, a moral conflict, a drama of each one with themselves, to have done something that not only the regulations say it's forbidden, that shouldn't be done because it's unbearable. But everyone think that's wrong, even me, I feel guilty because I do something bad. Now, in the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's in play, but another type of emotion. That's the shame. That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different: shame is a public emotion. A drama is not referred to a private drama of each one for themselves, for having done something bad, something bad. So, in the case of embarrassment, the problem is not me, but the others. The look of others that judges me in an incorrect, unfair way, sometimes cruel. Moreover, I have the fault or not, of having done something bad, in general, I don't have any culprit of anything, so it's a transformation, and I think this is a key to understand why these priorities are changing. Because it seems to me that the genius look, the other's look, that obviously was always important. Lastly, he earned a heavy weight, shaped, especially at the moment of judging who each one is and how much it goes. And this wasn't always like that, that's why I say it's a great historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, which is not from now on, that is being seated, and it's about one of the most important ingredients of this transformation. So, it's the abandon of the idea of internality. That's it, well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that preceded us and designed it from the Inte, the conviction that life existed inner, something essential? The phenomenon of social networks could be exceptioned by conquering the personal image of the physical aspects, the subject of gym or the status we do, and, well, I think that all of this is a lot more profound and true, but that, for example, in the case of plastic bags, it's not so much more deep, but that today the bulliness is not the most important thing in the body phenomenon of the body, it's not so serious, but that it's not so serious, but that it's not so much more important, but that it's not so serious, it's not so much more important, but that it's not so serious, but that it's not so much more important, but it's not that it's not so much, but that it's not so much more important, but it's a matter of the same, but it's not that it's not just a matter of the way, but it's not that it's not that it's not so serious, but it's not a matter, it's not that it's so much, And this, of course, is very complicated, because it demands a management, a administration of two vertents that seem contradictory on one side, we have to put ourselves. We don't have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and how we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and dissolve our image. But on the other hand, it's always the risk that it's the cyberbullying, when these bubbles or discomforts are diseminated by the networks, YouTube, Facebook, etc. And then, what makes us feel more vulnerable to the agenda, at least not without Wi-Fi, that's the subject. (Laughter) So, it seems that this idea that hell is us, it has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles, always visible in screens. That's not good or bad in itself, well, if all this is happening in fact, this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do, these best or worse than before is good or bad, how we solve it, but it's something we have in mind? (Laughter) Because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same that happened before, and we try to solve as if it were the same, we will probably not reach far away, that's what he wanted to tell you, thank you. I received the days, we talked to my children at home, and I told them we were living a historical moment, that we didn't forget about these days, and some of them told me. "Mom, I want to live a historical moment, but I'm good." But the doctor investigates his education and I feel that the pandemic put us to the force, in a kind of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school. And in these days I'm thinking a lot about this. That's it. Is there something we can learn from this educational scenario that we don't choose? And I think yes, that we are learning some important things, and I would like to share with you these ideas that are going around me and that I hope, in one of those days, we are going to keep thinking about education from here, in Adelante. The first time, for the first time, all of us and all the teachers together have the urgency of animals to find new ways of teaching. In innovation in education, it's something that comes to talk about closing, but that until now they were happening isolely, separated. And one day for another, we all, in simultaneously, had to help us give a huge step. With a lot of effort and forced by emergency, those who dedicate us to teaching, we are having to redesign our classes to distance, and in that process we are encouraging new ways to do things. And for that, we realized that there was no way to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available, but that we had never had until now the urgency in higher need to use. Storial videos, books in line, remote learning platforms, social networks, media, video calls, whatever that will help us to keep teaching, and especially to be connected with students, with families. And that in these days they are, but they are important. And the good news in the middle of all this, I believe, is that once we try them, we use them, these strategies already start to do samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our career of tools, and by little, we are also going to save new ways of teaching and learning. And this is not only happening in the formal system, today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching the line what they know, from yoga classes to tissue workshops. Even people with vocation of lessons are encouraging to do it, as they don't know if you come in these days, that older man who started to show how to be the compound to make banks, those people of their age. So we are learning the community. And the second rejection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn. In an investigation we did last year, we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school. The kids and girls told us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn, just like one and again. (Laughter) Suddenly, today, for another, that's happening. In these days, many families started to realize that many times kids, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own times, others start with the subjects that interest us, others connect with the classmates, to make the task, or a change in the web, to understand something that doesn't come out, or to learn something new, that they had earns. And this also helps us think about the education of the house, in front of us, because it makes us see that they are autonomy moments of children. You can combine with other distances in which we are all together working on the park. And it also tells us that for all children and girls to take advantage of those more autonomous moments, we have to teach them from very young people, to manage their tasks and everything they want to learn. And my last reflection comes to me a question. What happens when, as it happens in these days, we don't have the physical school as a place to go? The quarantine is achieving that we realize it, but not in a theoretical, declative way, but in our body. The value of school and the enormous task they are doing and they do every day the teachers. (Laughter) When kids and girls can't go to school, they appear stronger than ever their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn. When we try to accompany our children in school, I don't know if they're going through these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher. This pandemic is being more visible than ever the differences between the home, not only the one with a computer and the one who doesn't, the Internet, the one who doesn't. It's the one who has a calm place to study and the one who doesn't, the one who has here to ask, and the one who doesn't. The one who has to do all the care tasks of the house and the one who doesn't. The school, with all its difficulties, during a single day, at least, put between relatives and inequalities and it helps all kids and girls to be protected and focused. GB: And Naplaine Neur? Well, as an educator worries me a lot, as all this will follow, and I also ask myself what I'm going to stay of what we're learning in this quarantine. My feeling in these days is that. They waited for the sea to go to the Sunday beach. Among all that marriage, what breaks, what is carried, also on the beach, some treasures that were hidden. I wish, even though, as my son said, "This historical moment is not for anything good, it helps us make those treasures we are finding." The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach, to replicate the use of time and learn and also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers. Today, physics are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to build, among all of this, when all this happens, the education we dream. Thank you very much. At night I dreamed that the quarantine lasted too two months and that suddenly we used to live like this. The banks improved the jungle and that everything could be paid on the phone. That doctors operated by medicine, the patient at home, the doctor in the suit, Rayos X, the kitchen and good night. That the education of distance worked even better than traditional education, because the kids didn't have to stand up at 7M to study the Middle Ages, by the end, the ingenuous ones, that the workers of the State understood, finally, the functioning of the social networks shared those lies with their friends. That all the businesses worked for delivery and dreamed, I dreamed that the church was also online, I dreamed that an algorithm supported the lawyers and the judges, and that one day for the other, we all said what it seemed to us, and then won the majority of a day for the other, without northerns, nor catalogs, but not only four years, in the elections for president, every week, to do something noble. I dreamed that we visited the world through Google Hert and that we made the line in the street, already in an automatic way for Augusto, always keeping a meter and a half distance with the following. I dreamed that when we saw a neighbour, we greet them with the code, and that the solitary people who didn't want to live with anyone, we respected them because we realized that they were quickly looking for love in the neighborhood, and that seemed very good to us. I dreamed that the addicts had been recovered. The government announced the end of the pandemic, and in a very short communicated day the president told the town that was possible to go out to the street, and after that the state sent us a 3D printer to each one, but that in the field, to be able to buy important products, it would come out of their homes. I dreamed that a avestruz crossed the nine of Jurio and that without wanting, two minutes later, we crossed it against the greenhouse chair and discovered that we followed it in quarantine, we threw it to the street, to make a selfie with the vine and put it on the boat. And I felt better. Not so that when you see a picture, sometimes there are people who are a little more beautiful, but who appear a little more ugly in the picture, or people who are a little more beautiful, but who appear more beautiful. That fact caught my attention a lot, because if you think that photogenics exists. It means that photography can't end with the living portrait, you can't move it, and then a few years ago it begins actively to draw the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think is seeing, but not what you're seeing. So I hugged that challenge of seeing with detenment, of indaging the etymology of the gesture, the visual stimology of what we are capturing, and we use it as a lab. And we realized that a line is a place that came out of a walk. That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible, we have to look at it with definition, visible it. Now, a few days ago I asked my mom how much I thought I could get to know a person from their social networks in only 30 seconds. And he said: "That's it." And that's how I felt that party and I suggested to prove it. If I got to know at least ten things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or a myth with a weather that was left in the wood. Imagine my illusion when he accepted. I put the cranometer and went straight to Instagram, I wrote a letter to lazar and entered the first park appeared. I started until I started to see everything that person had published until the date. It turns out that in a girl who, more or less a month ago, a photo went up with the beautiful numbers 18. Besides, there were a lot of people, family, friends, Gachi Pachi, all singing the complete happy. So I suppose it was a very friendly person. Among these publications there were some art pieces of bank, and I said, "This girl likes art." Something that later could confirm with some photos she seemed to paint. That's why I kept going down and I discovered that those who are usually their best friend. So, what is a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design? And among all that, I could also see that it's a very healthy person who attacks Lukele and who covers it, that is, which is very respectful with the environment. (Laughter) But when these ten things had spent 28 seconds, my mother was very impacted, I couldn't believe that I could meet a person like this from social networks, it's true that in the networks each one chooses what he wants to show. Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100% real. But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be. I think there is a fundamentally different way to meet other people comparing how we did a few years ago. Before, everything I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months to pass a general idea of that person to know detail. Today, thanks to social networks, that is to say that this became completely, and it's the opposite, and something immediate. Thanks to this, I can know the first detail of the person as their personality, tastes, family, friends, and then with all that, to make a general image of the person, understanding how more than what I see in my first impression. An example is, like with the girl I found in Instagram, I didn't judge her for being trans, that didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to show her reality, on the contrary, finding with what I see in the other helped me question what I am seeing in the world. After doing this kind of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications called my attention, like those who talked about taking care of the environment, and then I started to ask myself, "What am I going to do?" And while I spoke to my mom and I was very funny, with a cream. We asked ourselves how these 30 seconds are transferred to our daily encounters. And that's when I realized that this different way of getting to know others, which are in social networks, passed the screens and is present in my daily encounters. And my behavior in the real world, that's how to say it, changed completely. To find myself with a person I don't know, I don't see any label to enhance it, I try to know it more in that first instance, I look for details, those of those I spoke to you at the beginning. I ask you all and without playing, and obviously I ask you to use the networks. Thank you very much. It requires attention to this image for a moment, please. And what parts of the face think they're looking at? You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first, what comes afterwards. Surely everyone will have happened at some point. For two eyes, for the fifth parts of the face, somewhere have been defined. Indeed, some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the pores and details were the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait. It was as if, somehow, these architects knew which parts of the face the spectators were looking for. To elaborate a portrait is to put evidence in subjectivity through the constitution of a look, and at the same time looking for the other, which is the one of the spectrum. So we thought what it would be if we can see how a spectator looks at. In a positioning team in a lab of neuroscience, we put several portraits in many people and registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image. What we get is how we build the image in time, if we put all the images together in the image, we could see what relevant parts are at the time of building, to extract information, since the rest constitutes it in the brain, how our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face, the portrait, and which is not. In some way, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that gaze, of the portrait we talk about, and the look of the spectators. It occurred to us to think then how a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks all together, the look of the others, what we've been using today was what I'm showing you and that I wanted to share with you. This very brief message for the record of an eye is the search of the foreign, of customs, languages, in which we transit with some maps of art and various leaves of rule of science, but that, fundamentally, we like to think in a way like a trip through the intersection of art and neuroscience. Well, in the exact moment we are born. We started to age. It's aging. It's the flow of life. The most natural process of human beings. Nevertheless. It's the most resistant. Do we invest so many resources in living more and more years? And even so? It seems it's a stage we don't want to get there. Nobody wants to be old. And why? A few years ago. When I started working in longevity issues, many people asked me, "What is this voice so young, taking care of old people?" And it's my future that I answered, "Who knows how to live many years and so I'm going." What I didn't say at that moment, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject. And it's fear. Fear to be old. DB: No. Fear to live in a society where the most important thing is. That being or seeming young. Fear. To make my knowledge and experience. They are losing value. What is my word? I didn't realize it. Fear to stay in the sea. All of this is happening today to millions of people. The discrimination for age is the most extended in the world. And the older women who suffer the most. Besides. The linked stereotypes continue to be socially accepted, can we see them? In advertising, in workplaces. Well, in the jokes we do. And the worst of all. It's that many times we don't perceive them or let them happen. These stereotypes fit older people. Let's take some generalizations that all put in the same bag. For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others. When the data of the men of social debt tell us that 70% of older people today in Argentina are self-valid, that is to say that they can take care of themselves and take care of others. Or this belief shared that the elderly are sad or depressed? When 80% says being happy, and that's much more than what people manifest me or even younger. Or this passive class label. A passive class. Who just seems to me that definition? Because it doesn't represent so many older people who are working today, creating. They are doing sports, participating in volunteers, taking care of others. stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact in people's lives, because they determine social and institutional behaviors. If I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying forward a super innovative project. Can you imagine someone like that? Do you know how difficult it is for a 65-year-old person to get a credit or a funding for their project? Even when it's shown. That projects where older people have more successful probabilities. However, I never found a scholarship. Neither a call nor an opportunity for funding that includes them. Another example: the empty that exist in the health field. Most public universities in our country don't exist the geriatry matter. Medicine students graduate to treat young adults. Not older. Everything related to aging is just a topic. And in general clinics. That's how we are preparing for the new longevity we just got. Or what's happening with university teachers, in any field, that at the 70s are invited to get rid of age issues. Who defines that chronological limit, all of 69 can give classes? And in 71 no. The media are not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes. A while ago, in a meeting with a national media, I asked them why, every time they treated the topic of older people, they used the same photo. That's it. From the older person, in a bank of square, giving them to eat the 'Palomas'. Well, they locate it. It's the only thing we have in archive, it was the answer. And it's so bad press, it has old age. That, in addition to images, we lack words. Adults older, third age. Travels. My parents are the traps. Girls. It's old. I still don't find a word that identifies or conforms to everything. Is it the only one who suggests to avoid: grandfather or grandmother? Except that they are their grandchildren, of course. Why do affection justify some? But if it's for affection. I could tell myself "mamita" because it's a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond. Most people have a name, like everyone. And the stereotypes? And they hurt them. They exclude. And they become invisible to many. Today, in Argentina, there are 6 million older people of 60 years old, in 2050, there will be more than children and teenagers. It's the social group that grows the most. And this is also happening in the world. We are already an aggressive society. And we don't want to see ourselves. Neither accepting ourselves. If we were assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities. To innovate? To create jobs, to design new products and services. This new longevity opens fined doors so that we rethink the next years in the economic, in social and cultural. And I'm going to give you an example, in this country. One out of three older people says that it's a need for recreation and entertainment. Little. Or athletes. Or that if they had the opportunity, they would keep studying and forming themselves. Nevertheless. The offices and education that exist are thought almost exclusively. For children and young people. All these opportunities we can't detect them intuitively. Because the elderly are a very different group that doesn't respond to traditional patterns that we still have in our heads. Besides. A lot of us still don't go through that stage. That's why my proposal. Is it that we listen and learn from older people? To really understand what their new needs are, their new possibilities, desire and tastes. A while ago, interviewing a older person, I wasn't clear if I wanted to do activities with people of their age or with more young people, and I asked him, "What do you want?" I want to be in life. Each stage in life has its potential. To discover it, we have to add our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality. Why old? They are not the others. Children. We are us and those we are going to do. That's it.
