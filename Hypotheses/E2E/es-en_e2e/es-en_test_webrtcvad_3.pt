(Applause)
I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me swimming.
It's very simple.
We need it.
Learn?
To feel?
To start and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lombocan Street, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
With that feeling of unbelievable.
It's surrounded by a great biodiversity.
I don't know how to run them.
Of tortugas, of mold fish.
There are fish from all colors.
I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature.
A very profound mystical and spiritual experience.
At that moment, I observed a small fish.
Travels.
Negers and yellow came out of a PC bank.
And it was just in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
And that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right?
It's the same thing my students think.
In the university, every time I tell you it.
Do you look at each other?
And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy.
But I'm not crazy.
(Laughter)
And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist.
He works 24 hours a week.
To display.
That artwork we're going to see.
Is it the opposite?
The maritime stream would take it, that mandate we see.
It proves that nature has consciousness.
And that I'm not crazy.
I'm able to talk to fish.
Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds?
Or with plants.
With rocks, with mountains and with other natural phenomena?
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific tests.
Last year, the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed.
Scientists.
They said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between companies and predators.
In other words, for every four bottles there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, of amazing forms to this same mathematical pattern.
It is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology.
I agree with the law of Clayber.
A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse.
It's about three rooms.
And if you stop thinking about it?
The truth is we live in.
It's made of three quarters of water.
Is it true?
So I ask myself.
Is it a mere coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research.
That is to say.
All those sciences.
What integrates and unify them?
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect.
To achieve a sustainable development, and here I bring you a summary.
And I remember how scientific consensus covers the explosion of the Big Times, the Universe came up to 13,700 billions of years ago.
The planet Earth was formed between 4.500.
I'm 20 million years old.
And the miracle of life.
It was between 1800 and 3.500 million years old.
During the first half of this period, the forms of primogenite life of the Earth kept very simple levels of complicity.
It's like the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere.
The first complex cells were originated.
Thank you very much.
It was the Cambrical exclusion of the metazoz.
It's the biological variety that has been increased to great speed.
I'm creating a wide, gama, organisms, multicellulars.
It's becoming strategies of survival.
And in bubbles.
And the atrophic chain.
The following thing seems to indicate that life came up and the depths of the oceans.
He couldn't reach the Earth until he was 450 million years old.
Or the disappearance of the dinosaurs of the Kurassic period, 66 million years ago.
This started the hegemonic period of the mammals.
Where to drive one afternoon, the first or less two pieces.
Thanks to fossil remains found until a fact that other libraries have four million years.
Momerectus is one of two million.
Money of dentalism and Homo sapiens.
Two hundred thousand years old.
In today, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of human species.
The ecosystem and co-evolution in the planet Earth.
Together to the rest of its biodiversity rich.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants a few 10,000 years ago, and especially from the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendental way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed.
It's like something unbearable.
(Sounds)
In a 30- or maybe 100 million species?
A single species, a nest or more?
It's destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species.
And that is indeed crazy.
We are all responsible.
Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs.
But the human being follows.
wanting to destroy everything around them.
This half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And if it seems we have forgotten ourselves from Hirosim and Kasaki.
I've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
Why do you get an idea?
Equibate the thermal fusion of stars.
That can reach 65 million degrees tired.
And if that was little?
The future generations.
Are you well threatened?
With the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth.
Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth.
Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Cup Forum of nature?
All of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
To place in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of...
fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have created a big global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine that we will be the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the bottles in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You already know the barbari, right?
Well, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
A scenario of chronic scarce of natural resources.
And they will be able to develop in a dignified way.
That's why we learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones who better adapt to the environment.
But he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
And if it's true that there is violence and predation and excess, in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines ...
What defines it?
It's not competence, but cooperation.
I'll give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Crossing, fighting, competing, to reach a novel, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not a competition, but a symbiotic union has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
The football, for example.
We all know that a team competes against the other.
But what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it.
It's our body.
Is it a plural cellular organism?
Where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are.
Paradoxically, nature is the best way to imitate and perfect to achieve sustainable societies.
After 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses time.
It has suffered catastrophes.
Of meteorite ice creations.
And constant processes of trial and error.
But human beings do create ideology for linear thinking.
Theatrine is politics, like anarchism that failed, the communism, which also failed socialism, failed.
The capitalism has also failed.
A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet.
It has more money than the rest of 99%.
That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because they murder nature to obtain economic benefits.
We've sent peace to the outside space and nuclear waste at the bottom of the sea.
The money has colonized life.
That's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
Have you seen?
Life, my goal, imitation, imitation of life.
But this is not new, the originary villages are already born, the indigenous people, for thousands of years.
And it's something inside us, we all have that faculty.
And I invite you.
To make a game.
What is your imagination?
What happens to this veruga?
How could engineers, architects?
The economists, inspire us.
Well, for them it occurred to them.
A plane.
What would happen to them with the peak?
From the Pajaro Martín Bolador.
The Japanese did the train Bala.
And with this Murciélago?
We could make a trunk, right?
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could make bioclimatic buildings.
But this is Girasol.
A plant of solar boards.
As we know, there are millions of species.
Therefore, nature.
Bio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But we continue.
Thinking about nature?
It will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive face of the GDP.
What does the GDP mean?
Many economists tell us that we have to make, build.
It's up to upload a so much percent.
Economics every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material.
For the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in.
It's not a gift for our parents.
Without a payment of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
A future to dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
I would like you to tell me.
Papy.
At least you try it, fight.
How many of you?
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) And what I have to say is that the quarantena is our opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, they are horrible things, we're going to do everything missing.
But it has many complicated supporters, politically.
It's economical, now.
We're wrong.
Socially with good, let's go to your friends.
This doesn't happen at all, but it's not because we think that it's an opportunity to take advantage of and that we don't take advantage of it and that it's a great moment to learn, it's a big moment for anything, it's a horrible moment.
Have you said that?
Life is not about something else, that happens horrible moments and learn from them: we learn pain, disease.
We learn from war, from death.
We have always succeeded and we're going to keep doing it.
I don't know what.
That's what we're going to do now.
And what I'm feeling is, I only have to enter.
What is an idea in which I was meditating from a book?
It's called "The Modor Nature Modor" and "Sini, it's the right armon."
These are the newspapers that took me to the 80s.
When am I diagnosed with HIV?
And then he decides to return to his childhood to the gardenery, but he's not a kid who, in fact, later, diagnosed him.
They are a lot of movies, very important questions, some of the important spaces of their career.
But what he decides is that he goes to buy a landing in a horrible place.
It was going to take care of a garden.
And it's impressive.
Like the person, "Do you write?"
It's that for him, taking care of a garden wasn't doing time.
It wasn't.
Yeah!
It's going through the mouse.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking, making bread or whatever.
Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks."
It provides us with sunsets.
And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism.
From Figengers, basically.
And that, more specifically, the feminist weapon.
To talk about reproductive work, isn't it the productive work that is the one who put new things in the world?
Can we say, that is, being a radio Prize or a Claudio doesn't matter?
And this reproductive job is to reproduce the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, take care of, right?
Thank you very much.
I had to cook the workers for the next day to put the factory, their reproductive work.
And the feminist took a long time, right?
By increasing, correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory.
Now, why the fat of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value?
It's even more, why don't we do it as an excellent insult and think that difference is contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a difference.
The more infection is given by one side.
Sure, of course, gender, there are areas that are important, these are the productive, traditionally performed by the aurorae.
And reproductive remains.
On the other hand, if you don't interview it, maybe it's not important.
And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the original subject, the world that the subject takes care of.
"No, take care of it."
It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you original, it makes you an artist.
You don't have a birthday, you don't have an important person.
Isn't it?
These are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days?
We are living without advertising, without farmers.
I say, "Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning."
But the world didn't go spinning without food.
Without care.
And without nurses?
And without health.
The only thing that allows us today?
How bad?
It's cool.
What a beautiful thing!
And without that, the world opens.
That's it.
Those tasks...
They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
It's not just something mechanical that we don't have to go through the river.
If I wish I didn't exist, if I could do it, clean it almost, cook, not only see food.
We can't think so, we've thought it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read to Germans is that...
And I also stop living them in a different way.
Can we live them?
Like tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what title is not modern nature, modernity.
Human beings have separated from the natural world.
Just do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
But the relationship of care with nature.
It's also interesting.
The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that someone is going to take care of the body.
No, there's the gym.
cooking.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
He looked at me.
This is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are.
And that the body will do something we have to overcome.
I don't think so.
This is an opportunity.
And, in fact, I want to return to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is.
No, we all live in this contradiction and life for absurdity.
Now.
I give you the world, you need more novels.
I thought, "Well.
Why not?
Instead of obsessed with being productive in these days.
And to know all the colds and with all that, why not think?
To connect with the world, with the body, with the care of others, in another way, from that.
That's why, when they invited me to do this, I don't know, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world hasn't decided to be a novel and the world doesn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought, we were going to write, read.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already taking care of.
I had with my books and I wanted to tell other people, right?
More than writing, reading.
And more, what to do?
Remember.
Thank you very much (Applause)
People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat.
My name is Pan.
Namas Dulces, Namas Portres.
Until now.
Thirteen days.
Have you ever thought?
It's the end of the middle.
These foods don't engage.
What fat is the misunderstanding way.
And it's disordened that we consume them.
I want nombrals.
Three key aspects.
To have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
Once, a teacher told me.
Conscious consciousness is secondary to brain activity.
And with brain activity, they lose experts on the subject.
I'm talking about our unconscious.
Our wishes, our beliefs.
So, if the consciousness rate is secondary to our desires?
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
But on the contrary, the one that doesn't like the most.
And later, that's it.
We are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating.
And in which quantity?
A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger.
Because when we have a man, it's not a man of a man.
The hunger of everything, the vorasiest and the hotest.
And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat.
He's always forbidden.
I've been the most attentive, right?
The one who makes diet, restricts, fast foods.
It's constantly thinking of pixas.
From sleep, grandmother, a fuel with double weight.
So?
Going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
That is, pizza.
Thank you very much.
I prefer a store, it's.
What does it mean, right?
The second aspect is practice.
To eat?
Like all processes in life.
It's learned.
And in this case, and in many cases.
That my include reains to learn.
But let's learn to eat in station.
What does this mean?
To eat the foods that have been harassed at that time.
That's what will guarantee us, a control.
I live in balance, in our weight, and putting a god in our health.
Because foods made of their own, of their time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest foods in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
That is to say, they are not additioned with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or is it normal to see tomatoes?
In winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
They will guarantee us, "Well, it will guarantee us a quality consumption."
And variety.
Where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating the same.
The last aspect?
That for me is one.
It's not smaller, but from the most important ones.
In moderation.
Those who don't disagree.
Because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time.
Because many times they give them anxieties.
I have a question.
Also.
Do you give them anxieties?
Do you repeat the plate of purchasing with frites?
To think, right?
So?
What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates?
That hunger is not handling.
I don't know if they are restricted in food, if they get out of food.
What is not consumed in the day will be consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion.
To be more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
Every time with more size, every time with more volume.
And every time with more strength.
So we don't stop.
Every three.
Four hours.
To take a collection.
That snowball will unfold in a boring way.
In the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we are going to disappoint all the foods around us.
To go over.
Together with this, I want to dismantle the lack of belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating.
The more rocks I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose.
And no.
The most expart body becomes to reserve.
Keep it.
And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this.
There's still everything we want to eliminate.
It's from our body.
The food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's talk, please, of that ignorance.
The food can hurt you or cure you.
It depends on us.
To be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and in what amount?
I go back.
It's the moderation.
That's how the phrase that must know it: "Let's see it with moderation."
Would it have to exist?
Coma with moderation.
The food stimulates overweight.
To give it a closet.
I propose you to eat rich.
To eat everything you like.
It's like eating a variety.
It's always taking care of the portion.
Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desajuna" like Ray.
Almorsa as a prince and scena as I mentioned.
I think many.
We know it.
The health doesn't have excuses, "I can't, I don't have."
That's it.
I'm hungry or worse.
Every time I died of hunger.
We have four opportunities a day.
To choose how to take care of and feed ourselves healthyly.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
For a while, I'm obsessed by telling stories of scientific women.
I love it: the first one that seemed obvious, Marie Curie.
They didn't read a Nobel Prize, they were two.
So it deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize but did incredible things.
Recently, I entered the story of Eugenia Sacerdote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war.
He made great contributions, among them, the most important thing was the one who brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s.
Thanks to her.
They saved thousands of lives.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002, I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to her.
And do you know what?
It died in 2011, I was 101 years old.
I found her very little.
How did she lose her, they didn't give her the idea to the bronk that she gave me, to have entered her very little, a lot of bronk?
That's why I tell stories of scientific women.
To honor those who went.
But, above all, to not lose those who are there.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography.
But kids keep losing a lot of time.
I clean the school with the ortography.
That's why photography.
I want to share with you a question: Do you do that?
Each new ortography, I think yes.
What we need or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question and the answer are new in our language, they are bouncing from the century for a long time.
Well, it's out of 1,400.
92 in the first grammar.
From the Spanish language Antonio de Nebrijas sent our ortography to a clear principle.
That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce as it is.
We went to each sound, I had to answer a lyrics.
Each lyrics should be represented.
To be just a sound and those who didn't represent.
But they had to eliminate themselves.
(Laughter) This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one that says we have to write, according to pronounce, is and is not there.
They are at the base of ortography, how we practice it today.
Yes, it's, why?
Spanish differentiates other languages such as English or France.
So, there was always a strong resistance to write too different from how we pronounced, but it's not, because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that guided.
(Music) (Applause) And before my father died, I remember looking at him closely to the eyes.
I had the eyes coffee with a sloppy around the Liris.
And to say goodbye.
Don't blame your eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and death.
Maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when they give us hunger.
I felt the need to look at her seeds at the microscope.
For the surprise of all scientists I approached with monocromatic images.
The discovery I made transformed my view of the world.
The whole universe inside my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute content.
It became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
This is the image of my father's seeds at the microscope.
And it's another.
It's the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection from anything or anyone.
Your death, more than a movie.
He represented the beginning where today is the project of my life.
That's the project.
For me, this is teaching.
That our most pure material essence.
We are scared by the cosmos.
And that when we look at the mirror.
There's maybe in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe in.
And that matter doesn't believe nor is destroyed.
It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle.
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
In Argentina.
Elimbap is a society of the state that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
His satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have...
The ability the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A bubble of education?
Imagine a public agency.
That designs content and strategies to transform learning.
That I work with schools to rewrite what classrooms happen.
That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
A agency with pedagogists.
Designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers.
Two teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
A mixture?
It's from innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's thinking about the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all the adjusts.
Just like that, changes in education.
Don't benefit the most advantages... (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm not a scientist, and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From big loves.
Invasions extraterrestrial.
Until pandemic.
Until the fiction made reality.
And here and now, at home.
We don't stop asking questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition.
Until the most ridiculous and the most worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession would buy mountains of hygiene paper.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
It has unconscious ideology.
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer.
It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy it.
It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government in only 10 days.
They hadn't only found the virus that produced the disease, but that they had sequenced their genome and had done it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us.
And not to be for another principle of the Mayan psychology.
It's called optimistic blind.
The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we speak on the phone or worse, while we send messages.
Thinking that, in fact, won't happen to us anything?
It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals.
Why does this happen now?
To us.
Unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas.
For example, in the Budonic Pest, in Europe, and in Chinese, in San Francisco, with the United States.
When, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets.
They are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick with other people.
However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs.
This first makes people who are sick and don't know how to tell this is very important.
But there's another most important reason: if they use more sheets, we get sick.
So this would be a sort of accusatory excuse.
Knowing who is sick and who doesn't use the most expensive names.
That they use it in the whole world is a way of avoiding the witness and with this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary capacity for change.
In the end, we thought,
What we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do.
This is what we have discovered now, for years we think that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it.
And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home.
We don't know some consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it is the award need.
And the world keeps moving.
And also, of course, they change our values, our judgment.
It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started.
The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties.
To confine people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible then.
That everyone has to stay at home seems completely prioritarian.
And if on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a small mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public consensus that includes the Organization of the Salud.
But also Government and other public sectors.
It has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move, who we find.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our face is viral.
And you can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of getting infected and who.
Let's suppose that this consensus can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way.
Those who are at home, those who are not at risk can go out.
And we continue this mental experiment.
Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but it moves much less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we show it.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why we don't want to see our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them.
It's still true.
Nothing free.
The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic?
And I could choose if it looks good or bad to do this.
What a few?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is.
I found, on one hand, privacy and individual freedom.
They are fundamental values, pilling in our culture.
And on the other hand, collective solutions...
That they are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe.
To see our data a little like vaccinating us.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom.
We found a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
A preservative man.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to get to feel free?
Careful.
Are you going to fly less airplanes in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet?
Are we going to be part of our data as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think freely than ever?
What do we want it to be the committed sex of the coronavirus?
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12, in a trip.
We did it with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
I saw a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind we call it.
Dolaries of sea.
They are relatives from sea airplanes.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment...
I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile.
The dollar of Mar fell down, the sand fell down.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way.
But...
I'm not interested in fossil or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been.
In the past.
They continued captivating me.
And they took me.
To study.
And dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist.
But the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
And I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a number that we paleontologists do.
We mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like this of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a amount.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life.
It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter.
It's in your head.
But well, life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
It's recorded.
Deserts and fossil studies of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa.
I'm studying fantastic fossils, but...
It has also led me.
A very special place.
What is Patagonia?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally.
We think of a bunch of forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils.
What do they want to be discovered?
We fortunately know many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world.
To look for dinosaurs.
And the vast majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia is the last period.
In which dinosaurs lived on Earth?
What we call critical period.
This is about 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While for that time, in the northern hemisphere.
They added other carnivores' families, like the dinosaurs, for example.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of the South wasn't.
Surprising because at that time, a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the Northern hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage that we know well?
What we call "jurassic period."
A hundred million years before.
At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea.
And we know very little.
What happened in this time, in the classic?
In the south hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet.
Suming keys, especially 60 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time.
They dominated the planet completely.
For the first time they tired giant size for the first time.
They differentiated themselves and conquered the living niches of carnivores, of omnivores in everything.
It planets.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships.
To explore the rocks of Patagonia's curasic.
And that leads me to one of the stories, in the discoveries we were able to do.
In the last years.
We found it four years ago, locked up like this, walking.
A lot of heat afternoon.
After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks on the floor.
And I got closer, as I got closer.
Sebe was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the trick of a dinosaur.
And I got closer.
I prepared the side, stood up.
I was really ice cream.
I asked myself what it was and I knew it was, after studying years.
The bones and anatomy of dinosaurs knew perfectly what the trace part was.
I gave a carnivorous dinosaur.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happened.
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
Until the next time given the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
To see if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found.
Or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day.
From the stadium.
We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur.
Very good.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular position of life.
Clearly, the animal was dead.
A layer of a lake and had already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way.
I was a skeleton.
And then the excavation begins: reading, staying, cap, cap, those sediments that were shaking.
It's a very exciting moment, it's for the first time.
Going back to the surface.
An animal?
That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
She had to be dead, she had to be covered by sediments caps that were accumulating until she got together.
Meters and meters.
It was filled with seeds and that food was transforming into sedentary rocks.
And in that same process, bones turned into fossils for chemical reactions.
After all that package of dry rocks, he had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming.
All this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover.
Those layers I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking from those hills.
I'm playing.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything you have to have happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very...
Emotioning.
Going discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun.
Patagonic wind, that doesn't lose.
And then we were able to carry.
All this rest is protected by layers to the lab.
In the lab, the museum begins another extremely long stage, where technicians, with infinite patience.
They are removing grain to grain.
All the rocks that cover the bones of it.
These dinosaurs.
And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizáurus.
Studying the anatomy of these rests what we saw.
It was that it was a parent, it was an ancestor of those wisdoms.
Carnegors of the south hemisphere.
And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before.
What we thought.
Many before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, of some rocks like these that we transport to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside.
Nine months of work in the lab.
We were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rock blocks.
Skeleton was quite complete and counted with a very well preserved meat and with very strange teeth.
Dents in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "man and Dance."
For this dinosaur, it's very particular.
That's why it's very special that it's one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replication of this dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton wouldn't take more than 50 feelings from the end of the tail.
And this mining of dinosaurs didn't look like anything in the forms.
We found what we knew about the North hemisphere.
Studying their rest we could see that their closest relatives...
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same old age.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of Pangea.
Or you haven't graduated from the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents today.
But we had a case again.
of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and they had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern.
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that live in this time, in front of fossils that have been found in this region.
And also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us.
Of the environments of this time.
By giving the climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic.
I used the existence of a great desert.
In the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century.
It was a great success what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere.
It was the lack of water.
What I had isolated these aunts was not a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are really fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of the body size, the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing is.
It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet.
Traping, every time.
Animals.
And the plants that lived in the past.
And while they were training.
The Earth is a big book.
They are a huge amount of pages.
It's written throughout 4.500 million years.
And life.
It occupies a prepondering place.
In the last 3800 million years.
There were millions of pages yet by reading this book.
And if we really want it?
To know our planet, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today.
It's fundamental to know your story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
"Yes."
It's also key.
To design a future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Audience: Yes!
(Applause)
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies.
I dreamed of competing.
To contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small lands of terrible invasors.
Well, time is.
It's not a reality bathroom.
It loses subtle and you don't have the magical variety of thesearry potatoes.
Instead of invading small villages.
And you don't have the passion of patterns to defend them.
But something about that child's vocation?
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And to try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
They are born in the real world.
Today I want to share with you.
There are six ideas.
For this rock?
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe?
It's the most important in this situation.
So, to live.
What is the superpower of thinking better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
Those I'm going to tell you are my ideas.
I learned from others.
And this is it.
The main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed.
But it can be developed.
Putting our mind with...
powerful ideas.
And practicing.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine they enter a gym.
Look.
That's on the floor.
My parents, my neighbors, my daughters.
Will they be half-volt?
They go to the bar, ask for a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they eat.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't improve with this.
Well, compensating happens the same.
It doesn't count being able to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice, think.
To develop ourselves is the habit.
You can't think.
And we give time to think.
Intelligence is not something that has or doesn't have.
It's something we use or we don't use.
The second one.
Do you see the saying?
Who only sees a mattress?
Who only has a mattress?
I see all problems as a keyboard.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
Neither to realize their keyboard.
If we have a tournament, we need a better disorder.
And if we need to cut something, we need a bear.
Do you have a box of tools?
With more tools it allows us to do more things, to solve more problems.
And tools are called mental models.
And we only have a mental model.
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get a ticket with a noise.
If we have many mental models.
Our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models find?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better we have to expand the box.
There are tools between heads.
It's no.
All the problems will seem uncled.
It's the third.
Little by little I was in the club and at the table of the side.
A man decides his friends.
He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
For a mistake, the teacher had committed.
Man was right in everything he said to his friends and he had told him something.
That's it.
He didn't realize it.
What? What? What?
In other words, this.
I was creating a much greater evil.
In Switzerland.
I stopped leaving it as a ton in front of his friends.
And I was deceitimating the teacher.
In front of all the children who had to learn from them.
Many times we don't realize it.
To be focused on earning a scale.
It makes us have success in that scale.
And without knowing it.
We do things that make us lose in our most important scale.
To have a discussion.
And to give a friendship, for example.
The disguise of freedom.
Or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, we think about what impact are we going to do?
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think.
How to act?
And the fourth?
The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impression is to have emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
As many Chinese situations arrived.
But those acts didn't generate impressions.
They generated emotions.
And that's not how we act.
When they started to get there.
Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These expressions were created in emotion.
Fear.
And the fear of generating action.
We are all now watched, preventively, what is very good.
This time we were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because someone has similar to us before.
But many times...
It's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us the modern civilization of prehistoric.
To get married is something.
Do you have hunger?
Have you got married?
You have an immediate reward.
That's how you eat what you get married.
But cultivating is very different.
Do you make the effort now?
It will take something that will take advantage of six months or a half.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But preventing us generate applause.
Because you're avoiding something.
Because nobody is Renicient.
But I leave lives.
We develop our ability to act before feeling.
That is to say, to develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main skills to think well.
Let's think a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now?
That's why it's still.
We feel, we live.
In China?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think we would last six months?
We are happy.
If something bad, it lasts three months and we think it would last.
The month is sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
In kilometers, we are exhausted.
If we program to run 20.
Nine kilometers are unbearable.
Let's take a story of resilience.
But a key to resilience?
It's to manage good expectations.
The sex is worthwhile.
Have you ever happened to you that you met a known place in a very serious place?
You're walking through a chicken in the middle of the swimming pool.
A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago.
You can't create an unlikely chance to find yourself in that place.
What's true, finding that classmate, in that place, is totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
Is it very likely?
To find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of life is the same.
Are there so many unlikely things?
It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us.
The problem is that our mind.
As it makes us think that the improbable is impossible.
And you don't do it.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now nor with more formal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with the uncertainty.
It's always leaving many open doors.
Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible.
In serious things.
Although they are very likely.
And if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have cars with the Atlantic of Nasta lleno?
Contestal.
"Why once?"
You found yourself in a village in the other side of the world.
With a high school classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years.
As I said, at first, that the idea of zero is this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being accepted.
To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking.
And from people.
With which we cultivate these ideas.
We can give ourselves people that enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
We try to change our own ideas.
A 40-year-old interview.
Entrevistator is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewed told me, "That's the same.
That same question four years ago.
More than that.
I don't know what I've done.
He looked at him.
And he said.
I ask for excuses.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that makes us live?
To be made of new ideas.
From the new ideas that are emerging.
To be always open.
To change our way of thinking.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to the emotional disorder.
That's why they need the custodian of a men.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives?
They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will succeed in a good husband when they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
From a manual?
For the education of girls and young girls about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, yes.
It has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times.
In 1915, no country in the world could vote.
In 2015, that is, today, 6 hundreds later, 65 countries.
They are governed by women.
In 1910 (Applause)
In 1910 Marie Curie.
He won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
(Applause) But...
The French science epidemic said he didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France, who entered the science Academy, was in 1979, 36 years ago.
Many of you here have already finished the primary.
The university, Harvard, has a very prestigious business school.
That in 1925, until now 50 years ago it's celebrating that, left a woman to be a master's degree.
Hale University admired women in 1972.
The Prince University recently in 1974, and we could continue and follow.
This was.
This idea.
That women only serve to create children.
And then ...
It helps the husband.
It's a rational series.
What a cistery!
It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment.
And almost all, taking 5,000, maybe.
They believed this idea.
It was a true fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing.
A conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm: it's a revolution that all revolutions...
Politics that we have experienced economics, if you are nothing on the side of this.
We are leaving ice cream, the idea that truth is true.
The idea that truth is a lie.
There are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem.
Now neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world.
Not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world is.
That there is outside, we can understand it once again.
When you say that there are no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe.
That interpretation is a kind of personal delirium.
That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations.
They are strong social arguments, they are the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretative mark?
What day is it today?
24th September.
Does anyone doubt it?
What day do you stop?
Well, let's convince it's on September 24th, because we're all here, we agree with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think:
That we are part of a very hard social construction that we have automatized and naturalized.
The cats live without calendar.
My dog, Chiap, archaeator, and who is very lonely at home?
No, making some misfortune.
I didn't know the time, I didn't know what I was going back.
It doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have...
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked at me to fall a apple.
He wrote the gravity law, "What a genius!"
But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
Have you lacked the trips I did, know the animals I saw?
Everything that had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
"And ...?"
To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print.
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea.
The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what it generates.
The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born.
But he was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now.
This is what we see in "Laz".
Scientific movements, technological innovation, that are increasingly located.
More developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts don't exist only interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
The revolutionary change.
How did we see it?
For thousands of years women were...
Those who took care of the house and created the children.
And, however,
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
The half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost by the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels.
How many remedies lost in humanity?
How much intelligence?
How much creativity?
In other words, errones are monsters.
There is an idea we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half ago, and that example, to study this process.
What is the creation of homosexuality?
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You'll say.
But how, in Greeks, Romans, pingüins, all those things, and yes, relationships between...
People from the same sex, both men and women, any other transgenere that happens to you to imagine today.
They always existed, in every culture, in all times.
They are even documented in many animals outside of humans.
But I had never thought about it.
That the sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined...
How was it a person?
Totally, sexual identity is created.
It wasn't innocent.
It was the moment of the generation of A.
Moral Víctorian, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak.
The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex when it proves us something we want to do, you don't have turbies.
(Laughter) You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you fault, it's a great social control.
(Applause)
"You don't say that."
To the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
No, that's it.
It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it.
And then, that is a form of terrible social control, because it dominates us.
Probably.
On the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they were private to eat.
We can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, there was a waste bathroom where everything that was bad in the society of the sexual point of view was put there.
The homosexuals during a century were terribly pursued in the whole world.
They don't have the right to talk or the right to defend themselves, the same as women before.
Or that the Jews, or that the blacks who had left slavery, and we didn't talk about when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, it also changed the situation of Jews.
None of these situations are ideal.
We all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century.
It's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, this ends up raising now.
In many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
"Thank you."
Fusilated.
But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, for the paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc.
They are all depressed.
They take their identity.
They make themselves respect and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full right.
But there's a drama of social struggles and it's that you have to get into the prison that discriminated me.
To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish.
So that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, as a black man, only black, and the same thing is gay.
And the gays, the women, the Jews, the blacks, the white, we are all complete, complex people, contradictory.
That maybe I don't have any money, I like it as a guy.
It's exchange.
Isn't it?
But, however, we have to assume that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible in jail.
Of the jails.
(Applause)
50 years ago?
Look how old I am.
It was a homosexual child.
I didn't know what a homosexual child was.
It's bad.
I didn't know the homosexual word, and they didn't tell me like that, my school classmates told me: "I agree, we're going to turn around." (Laughter) "Trolo, don't look at me."
I didn't know what to do, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything.
And at the same time.
I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me.
I didn't know it was.
I went back home, from school.
And I saw that my father loved me.
I looked at me.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so that it come out like that?
What was it like that?
I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there is.
There was a positive side.
I learned to be respected.
I learned, Jewish here, women here, black people too, have learned the same thing that today I had to know ten times more than others, do everything better than others, not for them to measure a prize, a job.
Or they applause me, but simply so they wouldn't reject me.
I had to...
It's to make me a lot and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person, like any other person in the world.
Among the dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual.
We are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay at 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity.
20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had.
It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist.
(Sounds)
(Laughter) (Applause) There are interpretations, there are contradictions and babies, because it's really that, we are contradictory, there are facts, contradictions and contributions are also interpretations.
They don't exist the facts.
There are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to accept staying there to defend myself.
I want to go out, I said.
And when I signed it.
When an idea breaks, it's that it doesn't mobilize, while we only have it in our heads, it doesn't serve us.
Do you give her body?
I left prison.
And I left my prison, it was so wonderful.
Have you thought about staying?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Audience: Favelados!
(Music) (Music)
(Applause) There's an eye.
They didn't tell me.
It requires a list of things we need to survive.
It's called "the basic one."
The war of idea: to live constantly with this canasta.
Mexico, San Pedro, our community.
But it contains the things we need to survive.
And better I had the things we need.
But now it's something difficult.
It's a closing one.
Each moment and place are completely different.
The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations.
It's a moment.
Of course or small.
full of compulsions.
Where a storm falls and everything you know disappears.
And when everything you do has paid for the voices of someone else.
You, not even in a microphone.
It duplicates the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstecure it.
But once you say it.
Once you achieve your words.
I'm in a avalanche of ideas that come towards all speed.
Each of these ideas looks like a bomb.
I try to determine.
But some of these ideas.
Good afternoon.
I'm going to choose everything.
You want to have your paraguas and cover them.
I can do it one side and in part with each one of them.
Each moment is a combination of energy.
And to decide to get up, to shoot or run.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated: learning to harm your own movements.
A class is not bad.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment.
And even if life buys music, movements, I believe it.
Movements that take moments.
Like a chain.
Moments in which you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories.
In a notebook.
I remember that they probably won't be an art work.
But they will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
For me, it was the one who saw that face when he spoke about what he loved the most, the speed is the one who went to your heart.
Or how do you start when I spoke?
That voice.
That voice that you so much know.
That you know that you're probably looking for something you've lost.
That voice.
It's your best friend.
I'll always talk about it.
It will be the first to defend yourself, the first to walk in the puzzle to jump that sea of possibilities.
And at the same time, the first one is in that ears, in that east to jump for you when I need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend.
Without that, without that, I can't survive.
(Applause)
(Cheers) (Cheers)

What we created in girls' cities.
I'm sure we've ever said it.
I say, "Because you're here."
Very naive to be ...
It wasn't like that, I was treated there.
I can't progress in the way I would like to change.
Doctors.
That's it.
It always appears on stage.
A person, for what they want, is already in years.
Chanosa.
And with a belly, you agree with your experience, if you don't understand nature.
If you remember that all the time was better.
Is this really like that?
Or maybe?
We don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
To think about this.
Unfortunately, I remember my friends of all life.
Juancho, Ranco and Manuel.
These photos are seeing there.
It's 2009 when I saw the secondary school.
What can I tell you about my friends?
And it was a lot.
They are like my brothers.
And that there are three superable people.
And that, as I didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like the power I liked.
They stayed here in the city.
And go to surprise, to the day of today.
You can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams.
While I'm in the room in this photo.
The brand of opportunities was also present.
My biologist, who are workers.
I made an effort on the human I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I didn't know that if I stayed here in the city.
I could study something, but probably the future as a person is going to be opportunities.
Have you ever wondered why these things happen?
Children have been among one.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and advances...
Let's be a society that surprises us all.
And the borders and the barriers that exist between people.
In this context?
Cities to make more and more important cities.
Let's go to the sincero, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound to you.
I'd have to be almost 10 people in the whole world.
Seven out of every day.
If each other more people choose to live in cities.
And it's called where we have the greatest chance to cry.
What do you explain in two centuries?
(Laughter) When the city is closed, they seem to get rid of time.
Other progresses are vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them.
I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to record here.
When they get out of that door, they return home.
What is this?
It's strategy.
If we want globalization to help us to provide more opportunities to people.
We needed to go strategically to the world.
Stop my concern.
As a professional future, in the field of international relationships.
It happens precisely for this.
To connect cities?
With the opportunities that the world has to offer us.
It's not in a different way.
If we don't feel our strength, our potentialities, right?
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you'll tell me, "How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?"
Through concrete projects.
What improves the quality of life of the population?
And they avoid migration to other places searching for a better future.
Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends.
This is a picture a few months ago.
And so, Clevita can be noticed a couple of things.
Or to start?
Let's add a fifth to my opinion, it's a group.
Do you know what it is?
I saw her something in case.
Secondly, we can also say that a kind of universal relationship is given.
As it was decorating the quality of the photos of the phones.
What I was dying was going to improve.
Some of them have a couple of threads.
And we'll have to be a half ugly.
Do you know what we share until today?
Besides the deepest time we have students with us.
The lack of opportunities.
Is it white?
For example, the one that is also made in this picture.
It was the national champion of the solidarity of geography in 2002.
I love you so much.
A rational.
But today, besides they want to dedicate themselves, they had geography processors.
It doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday.
Working.
Slowly, they can live.
And then?
It's funny!
It's the one who's left below, who just goes to his audience.
I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to extract in one of the security for the country.
I mean, as I didn't count with that possibility here, from then on, changing career without finding what he really was passionate about.
And I can't get a job that allows seven economical dependencies.
Finally, it's not bad.
That it's a genius of mutation, but they don't know the geniuses, they see anything.
Do you realize it?
Every day working in their local that built from nothing itself.
Go to college to study programming.
And you can't develop your potential if you want to believe in what you like.
Because they can't be made of necessary tools.
An orphan of presupportage in diversity.
The guy studies programming, and he doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study.
And the worst of all this I'm telling you about.
Audience: Yes!
We, as young people.
What do we have?
Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
That's it.
According to English, I had the huge fortune to leave the selection between a group of 8 young leaders at a World Cup.
To participate in a week in New Day and the capital of India.
I traveled in the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentine in that event.
Audience: Yes!
Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back.
I learned a lot.
But there are two things I would like to share with you.
They are following.
One, one.
There are millions.
Audience: Yes!
I will never be able to say it with the sufficient lamp for you.
They can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities out there.
For all tastes and for all colors.
First.
We have to be willing to find them.
They don't come alone.
In one of the two.
But not less important.
In our human resources, with more Argentines.
They are brilliant.
We don't have any equity to young people, the state of bones.
Neither the Chinese.
It's real.
Do you know what the differences we don't have?
What do you want?
And a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop themselves.
Once again.
We want better cities.
We do it strategically to the world.
Remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could stop studying.
With three days to fulfill 18 years.
They were me.
I was really scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never tell you in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult for your city.
(Audience) Good evening.
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
What is this for?
I don't have to go to my pocket.
Who are the friends?
And nobody you know?
It's necessary to give them tools to our young people.
To stay in their cities, they can grow from there.
"Wow, that's cool!"
Who's hurting?
To give them wings to the city they had to do.
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine the brilliant.
"What would it have been strange?"
If I could dedicate myself completely to geography.
How much?
And today I was in one of the strength of security in our country.
Or to laugh so far away, Emanuel.
I had the necessary programs to continue to understand what I like.
Is it like that?
Ah, yeah!
"Thank you."
It's true, it's missing opportunities.
Thank you.
All of this.
And I decided to tell you.
But it seems sufficient arguments.
Do you want more example?
Please forget it.
This one!
It's the tattoo.
They tell me when I finally run.
Good afternoon.
The profound depression invites.
In which I fell, I'll have to go to college.
Right?
Two suicide methods.
In numbers.
Psychological schools?
And she told me everything.
Thank you very much, very much.
If we want these things to stop passing?
We have to go out strategic and change this world.
Please!
We don't eat a final point in our cities.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I'm a surgeon.
Since always, surgeons.
Do we think that to have more work?
We have to look for it.
More reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years?
My research.
In my case, in the zoo.
He got married.
To look for the reasons.
To operate.
Every time less to patients.
That's it.
We can do it in several ways, for example, looking for genes.
To detect more early diseases such as cancer and so you don't have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
For themselves.
using their own ability to regenerate.
What is this?
We do it.
With biological platforms.
They are like maps.
That we give it to the tissue.
To use their own capacity.
To restore yourself after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope.
To make procedures.
And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out.
Robotics.
They were giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What is before?
It seemed science fiction.
Today it's.
It's almost daily.
Alucinating.
To challenge.
My own paradigms of...
To have more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfactions.
Am I?
And even a lot of patients.
That they avoided.
We have to make a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
That developing methods, increasingly invasive.
I have every time.
More work.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I would like to share a reflection.
Especially what a collective culture can mean.
In a moment like this.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese.
And also in my work of many years, I've had contact with issues.
Literaryies.
sociological and anthropological of Japanese culture.
And I believe that certain behaviors.
And answers.
Social and individuals.
Of the Japanese society.
They can help us.
At the time of facing a crisis like this.
It's worth asking us a first question.
Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage?
If in January the first case came out.
Being so close to the neighbour.
Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space.
I'm talking about the third age populations.
Most.
Is the world?
Being in the second country with more smoke.
For many inhabitants.
Because in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth.
He signed a great progress.
And the identified?
Until now.
We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious.
In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease.
Basically.
A lot of people.
In a little place.
And a room, those people.
With more than 65.
It goes to a time.
Japanese is a society.
Is it educated in such a way?
That responds in an organic and humid way.
Before any event that compromises it.
Japan went through wars.
What a ghost!
His name is ...
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
1,000 temblors per day.
Generation, transgeneration, has had to overcome catastrophes.
Naturals.
He was generated by the man.
We can think about this.
With something that likes Argentines a lot.
What a soccer team?
How an example?
What kind of soccer will it have better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day.
Each one knows what to do.
Or the team that never trained.
It doesn't have infrastructure.
And it has to come out to improvise.
The directives.
I have social distancing.
That's it, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether in society or in your own house.
The Japanese population hasn't established for hundreds of years.
It doesn't need to say, it doesn't embrace.
Not giving beers.
Because they don't do it.
It greets with a reverence.
In other words, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public places use a lot.
It's not necessary to recommend, to take out the shoes.
To enter the house.
Because it's already used.
We don't have to indicate "non't be harmful about another person."
Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected.
Not to protect ourselves.
If not to protect others.
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
That's the good of the whole.
It's more important than the good of a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They made two Western teachers.
In a school, in Japan.
You will surely know the game of the chairs.
You put music, chairs in a circle.
A less than the quantity of participants.
And they will get out of one.
In each round.
He made this experience in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers.
The word " japonesa" loves.
The company is the way to be.
In other words, it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me, in resonance, consent that we realize.
When we take care of others.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works.
(Sigh) Do you help yourself?
Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
(Applause)
