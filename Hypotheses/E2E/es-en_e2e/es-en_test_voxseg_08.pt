I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
I need you to help me swim.
It's very simple.
Well, we need it.
And to learn, to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lombocan Strait, in Indonesia.
30 meters below the water.
With that feeling of unbelievableness surrounded by a great biodiversity.
Corral recipes, tortugas, mold fish.
And fish from all colors.
I had a feeling of being connected with nature.
It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish.
Thank you.
Blacks and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me.
We were looking, right?
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
"Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking."
It was a very spiritual feeling, and that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right?
So it's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell it, look at each other.
And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy.
But I'm not crazy.
And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist.
He works 24 hours a week.
For you to play.
AC: That artwork we're going to see.
Or the opposite?
The maritime run would take it, that mandate we see proves that nature has awareness.
Well, and that I'm not crazy.
And if I'm able to talk to fish.
And will it be true that indigenous peoples are indigenous?
They can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena.
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific tests, last year the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems were analyzed.
Scientists?
They said there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between companies and predators.
That is to say, for every four bottles there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, in amazing forms, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology.
And I agree with the law of Clayber.
A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse.
But three, four.
And if they stop thinking about it.
And what do we live in?
It's made of three quarters of water.
Thank you.
So I ask myself.
Is it a merac coincidence?
CR: Or, really, nature has an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study.
It's the great story of my PhD research.
That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify.
And the history of the universe, the Earth's planet, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development.
And here I bring you a summary.
I agree with my scientific consensus.
It's like the explosion of the Big Bang.
The UN came up to 13,700 billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.500 and 5,000 million years ago.
And the miracle of life.
Between 1800 and 3.500 million of AI.
During the first half of this period, the forms of primogenite life of the Earth kept complexity levels, very simple.
According to the oxygen appearance in the atmosphere, the first complex cells were originated.
With the Cambrical exclusion of the metaphor, the biological variety has been increased to great speed, creating a wide range of public organizations and cell phones.
Because it's developing strategies of survival.
Focus of very singular energy, like, for example.
DB: The kitchen.
The following thing seems to indicate that life happened and the depths of the oceans, it wasn't able to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago.
With the disappearance of the dinosaurs of the Kurassic period, 66 million years ago the he started the Egemonic period of the mammals from where he emerged one afternoon, the first or small pepper.
Thanks to possible remains found until a fact that other libraries have four million years.
The homosexuals are the two million, the near dental men and Homo Sapis, 200,000.
In fact, homo sapiens is the only survivor of human species that cohabits and co-evolution in the planet Earth, along with the rest of its biodiversity rich.
From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants a few 10,000 years ago, and especially from the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago.
Human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendent way.
But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed.
It's like something unbearable.
It's between species.
In a 30-year-old Parliament or maybe 100 million species, a single species.
A humanitarian?
It's destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species.
And that's how it is to be crazy.
And we are all responsible.
Because life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve everything.
But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him.
In this half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
And it seems that we have forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of stars that can reach 65 million degrees.
And that's why it was little.
The future generations are also threatened by the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth.
In the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth.
QD: Since 1990 to the year 2020 we'll predict that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Forum of nature?
All of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater, and we take fire to the bottles you are sitting in.
Yes, imagine.
You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
A chronic scenario of natural resources.
They won't be able to develop in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate.
(Laughter) Darwin told us that only survives the strongest, those who adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
If it's true, there is violence and predation and excess, in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but cooperation, I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach an egg to fertilize it.
What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
Well, soccer, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it.
Our body is a plural organism.
It's where millions of cells cooperate to do what we do.
Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect, to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time, it has suffered catástrofes of global ice creams.
Political doctrine, like anarchism, who failed the communism, which also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism was also failed.
A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest 99.
That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
It's not adapted to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because it's signed to nature to get economic benefits.
We've sent peace to the outside space and nuclear recipes at the bottom of the sea.
Well, money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
It's life, my my mythical imitation, imitation of life, but this is not new, this is already doing it with original peoples, indigenous people, thousands of years ago, and it's something that is inside all of us, we all have that faculty.
And I invite you.
Let's play a game.
Let's see, imagine.
What happens to this vegetable garden?
Or how could engineers, architects?
The economists, inspire us.
Well, it occurred to them to make a plane.
What would happen to them with the peak?
From the "Pajaro Martín Bolador."
Well, the Japanese did the train Bach.
And with this murciano?
We could make a trunk.
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could make bioclimatic buildings.
And with this is Girasol.
I see a solar board plant.
As we know, there are millions of species.
Therefore, nature.
Bio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But we keep thinking that nature will always be there.
And we have to overcome the cognitive face of the GDP.
What does the GDP mean? Many economists tell us that we have to make and build?
To climb so much percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material.
For the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
A dialogue future with their children and grandchildren, I would like them to tell me, "Dad!
At least you try it, fight.
PK: And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Laughter) And I have to tell you that quarantine is not forcognated and covering me.
They are horrible things.
We didn't do it all we needed.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, mentoring.
We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our family.
This doesn't happen at all, it doesn't matter what to think is an opportunity to take advantage of and that we are not part of something, but we take advantage of it, and it's a great moment to learn, it's a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
I said that.
So life is not about something else, that happens horrible moments and learning from them: we learn pain, disease.
If we do it, if we're going to keep doing it, we learn from war, from death, so that's going to be now.
And what we have on the Internet?
It's an idea in which I was meditating from a book.
And then he decides when the diagnosis of HIV returns to his childhood to the kindergarten, "Prexman is a sign that, in fact, is a lot of very important movies, some of the important spaces of his career.
And what he impresses is that he goes to buy a place in a horrible hospital and he will take care of a kindergarten, but what he decides today is that he will buy a terrible person, as a strive person.
It's that to take care of a garden it wasn't to be time, it wasn't to pass the route.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking, doing pan or oxygen.
Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks you've experienced are those."
And they thought then about the concept of reproductive work, which is a productive thing, which is a concept that comes out of sexism, from Fri de Gengers, basically, and that later, more specifically, the maximum feminist approach for us to do that, clean, cook, right?
Basically, you cook the workers for the next day to put the factories, their reproductive work, and the female took a lot of time.
By increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory.
Now, why do the fat of thinking about that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
It's even more, why don't we do it as "derexman" and think that this difference is contrast between productive and reproductive work is a more infective difference given by one side?
And it's something that doesn't make you special, it makes us originate, it makes us think, it doesn't make you an important thing, it's something that doesn't make you special, it's important, these are the productive, it's unbearable for the organs, and the reproductive ones, because it's unbearable.
Let's think it's the opposite, even if the care tasks are the most important ones: How many days are we living without writers?
"Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning."
But the world didn't go spinning without friends and without care.
And without any health, the only thing that allows us today is to eat and cure and clean.
And what about that, the world?
Beautiful.
A: Those tasks.
They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
It's not just something mechanical that we have to go through the river, not only see the food, not only see the food; we can think about it, we thought about it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read to Germans is that...
Just as we can also live them in another way, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what title is not modern nature, modern nature, not as the human being separated from the natural world, that only makes it interesting with nature when it turns it into something else.
Without the care relationship with nature.
The relationship of care with our bodies, we think that we have to take care of the body, the gym or cook, only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
It's better.
And that is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are.
And that the body will do what we have to overcome.
I don't think so.
Well, this is not an opportunity.
And, of course, I want to return to my life, "No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is."
We all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
In fact, the world needs more novels, I thought, "Well.
Why not connect with the world, with the body, with the careers, with the others, and with all the colds, and with all that, why not think of connecting with others in a different way from that?
That's why, in fact, when they invited me to do this passive that I don't love because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide that the world didn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought, in fact, we were going to write to read, that I had with my books, and that maybe I wanted to tell other people, right?
More than writing, reading.
And more, what to do?
Thank you.
M.B: People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat.
My name is Pan.
I have more dulces, no more posters.
Past, every 15 days.
Have you happened?
It's a end of the middle.
And these foods are not fat.
GG: What's fat is the dismissioned and disordered way we consume them.
I think I want to name them.
Three key aspects to have a good food.
The first is consciousness.
(Video) Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness rate is secondary to brain activity."
And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if consciousness is secondary to our desires?
And we would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
But the opposite, the one that doesn't judge the most.
And after this, are we aware of what we are feeding, what are we eating?
And in what quantity?
KA: A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger.
Because when we have hunger, there's no blood of apple.
The blood of everything, the vorasiest and the most caloric.
And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat.
I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attentive, right?
The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas.
B, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double weight.
So, that's it.
Going back to the subject.
Are we really able to say "pixa"?
Thank you very much, I prefer a store.
Impossible, right?
The second aspect is the practice.
Let's start.
It's like every process in life.
It's learned.
And in this case, there are many cases.
That my include reains to learn.
We must learn to eat in station, what does this mean, to eat the food that have been harassed at that time.
This will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and by making a god in our health.
Because foods are made of their own, of their time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest foods in nutrients.
And they are not chemically treated to subsist in time, that is, they are not addicted to calories.
It's necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruit all year, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer.
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating mine.
The last aspect?
For me, it's one.
Well, it's not less, but it's from the most important ones in moderation.
Those who don't disagree.
Because they don't have hunger, they don't have time, because many of them give them anxiety.
And I have a question.
They also give them anxieties.
Let's repeat the plate of purchasing conflicts.
To think, right?
I don't know.
What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates?
Because hunger is not manipulable if they are restricted in food, if they get out of food.
What is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion.
To be more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top.
Every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength.
So, if we don't stop.
Every three.
Four hours.
I'm going to take a collection.
That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we're going to disappoint all the food around us.
To go over.
Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose, and no.
The most expart body becomes to reserve, to look.
And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our bodies.
But food doesn't only make you fat.
Let's leave, please, of ignorance.
The food can hurt you or cure you.
It depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding and in what amount.
That's it, I go back.
And that's the moderation.
So, how is the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation?
It should exist a coma with moderation.
That food stimulates overview.
To give it a closet.
I propose you to eat rich.
I'm going to eat everything you like.
Being a varied, but always taking care of the portion.
(End of video) Not for anything there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "Almorsa como prince" and "sena" as I mentioned.
I think many of us know it.
(Video) The health has excuses: "I can't, I don't have one."
That's where hunger happened, or even worse.
Sometimes I die of it.
We have four opportunities a day.
To choose how to take care of and feed healthyly.
Thank you very much.
How am I obsessed by telling stories of scientific women?
So I love it: the first thing that seemed obvious, Marie Curie, they didn't give a Nobel Prize, they gave them two.
So it deserves its pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize but did incredible things.
Little by little, I entered the story of Eugenia Sacerdote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war.
He made great contributions.
Among them, the most important thing was the one who brought the vaccine "Salk against polio" in the 50s, thanks to her.
They saved thousands of lives.
I'm a scientist and more or less since 2002 I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively until 2004.
And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to them.
And do you know what?
It died in 2011, I was 111 years old.
I entered her very little.
How did I lose it, not give you an idea to the bronk that this gave me, having entered them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who went?
DB: But above all.
(Applause) We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography.
What about the kids?
They keep losing a lot of time in school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
That's it.
A new ortography is missing.
And I think so.
What do you need or better?
And I think we need to simplify what we already have.
And the question and the answer are new in our language.
They come by bouncing it from the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Castellan language.
Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound should correspond to a lyrics.
Each letter should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound.
But they should eliminate themselves.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one that says we have to write.
According to pronouncing, it's and it's not at the base of ortography, as we practice it today.
It's because Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, has always had a strong resistance to writing too different.
It's not about how we pronounce, but it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that I wanted.
And a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological, the one who says that we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with waves and cuts, which, unlike what many people think, have never been differentiated in the pronouncement of the castellation.
Three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience, we all went to school.
All of us invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and child brain, indicated, in the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions.
They brought us in many simplic and explicit ways.
And the idea that in ortography something was fundamental was played.
It's one of our training.
However, I have the feeling.
So the teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes.
Ortography is useful to uniform writing so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it.
But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example, in ortography there is no individual ability involved in punctuation itself.
With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase, with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm.
What I'm writing with ortography, not with ortography, or it's good or it's bad, according to justice or not to the smart norms.
But then, wouldn't it be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly?
Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms?
To give all that time to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to abolish.
I think ortography is not.
And each one writes as they want.
The language is a common use tool.
And therefore, it seems fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But it also seems fundamental to me.
That those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done.
It's true.
We check our ortography.
Because we are not leveling down, when ortography is simplified, it's not recent at all.
It was the quality of language.
Shot.
I work every day with the literature to say it about Ourolego, Garcillazo, Servantes, Agongora, what do I see?
That sometimes they write "men."
Without H, sometimes they write with a decoration.
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between that.
These, and ours?
It's of convention or lack of convention in their time.
Well, but not of quality.
But let me go back.
They are the teachers.
It's key in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive.
With teachers knocking us and knocking us with ortography.
But the truth is that things are like these.
This has a whole sense.
What is our society?
Ortography works as a privileged indice that allows us to distinguish the culto of the brutal.
The education of the ignorant, regardless of it.
What about the content?
Of what you're writing, you can get or stop getting a job for an H, that I put or stopped putting.
You can become a bubble object.
For a B?
Malcolocated.
But then, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Because throughout our language history, they were always teachers.
Or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters.
Those who pushed ortographic reforms.
Those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had the place.
It was in Spanish tongue, from Chile, on average.
In the 19th century.
Why then?
I said, "I'm going to take it."
It was one of those teachers.
And start.
To move forward in our ortography.
In the intimacy of us, 10,000 wanted to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate Himula.
That's where we wrote a H.
(Laughter) But we didn't produce anything.
And we didn't write anything.
(Laughter) It's hard to think that kind of sentimental attach can justify for someone?
All the fathers?
That causes us the mood H.
Velarga and B Corta, we said.
But they never distinguished themselves in the Spanish language: "We choose one, it can be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument."
But we don't believe it.
Let's eliminate the other.
"He's an idiot," we divide the functions, that the ice stays the Sweden sound, Gato, Mago, Aguila, and that the jump retains the sound "asperó."
Jarabe.
Girafa, people.
It's Argentine.
That's it.
That, Iceta, it's an interesting case.
Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide.
But it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended: "Now I said before, I know that Iceta."
In some places, they correspond to a sound, in other two, and from three letters, we go to two.
We are all better.
Some of these changes may seem a little dramatic.
But they are not that much.
And the Real Academy Spanish, all the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified.
That language.
It's connected to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes I attach to history, traditions and customs.
It becomes an obstacle.
And for today's use.
That explains, in fact.
That our language is much more.
That we know, that we have geographically.
Thank you.
We were historically modified, for example.
We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol.
And little by little, now.
But they start to remove themselves exhausely some dead Hs in the dictionary of the academic Real.
Armony can be written with H or Sinache.
And we're all fine.
(Laughter) Does it look like me?
That this is a moment.
Particularly appropriated to face this discussion.
It always tells us that language changes.
And it's spontaneously below, up.
They are the users who incorporate new words.
Those who introduce gramatic modifications.
And that authority, in some places.
A academic, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
In other words, a long time later, they accept them and incorporate them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the text level for the word level.
It's less true.
For the grammatical level, and almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always historically changed above.
They were always the institutions that fixed the norms.
And they proposed modification.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Well, until today.
The writing has always had a much more restricted and private use than it speaks.
(Laughter) But at our time, the time of social networks.
And that is suffering a revolutionary change.
It never was described as much as now, they never wrote so much to the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time.
And we're seeing a large scale.
There were novelous ortographic uses.
Where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks.
It behaves quite similar to how they behave.
The majority of the users of social networks is to say.
They relax the ortographic correction and priorize.
I had the speed and effectiveness in communication.
Now, that's it.
There are chaotic help.
Individual.
But I think we have to pay attention.
Because they probably are telling us that a time signs writing to a new place.
I asked you for that writing.
new criteria.
I think we would do bad.
They wanted to reject them.
To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them.
It's inside a more affinable normative with the needs of our time.
I can anticipate some objections.
There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography.
But we should learn.
Latin, Greek, Arabic.
Or with a simplified ortography?
We're going to recover etymology at the same place we're going now.
And also to etymological dictionary.
It's a second observation of those who say.
If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguishing between yes words that are different in only one letters.
But that's true.
But it's not a problem.
Our language has ormonies, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit money, the suit that we put on the things we traveled.
In the huge one.
Because most of the situations, the context dissipates any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
What did I do for me?
Even the most comprehensible, the one who says.
I don't want to change.
I educate myself like this, I get used in this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortography, my eyes hurt.
That objection is within each one of us.
And what do I think we have to do how we always do in these cases?
In other words, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught.
But those who don't want, let us write how we are used to it.
And you wait for time to feel.
There are the new norms.
The success of all ortographic renovation.
That they touch so arraigated habits.
It's in the prudence the consensus, the fat-alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the rule, the old customs, prevent us from going forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past.
Is it improving?
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree.
And clean from our ortography.
All those habits we use because we receive them.
Although they don't serve us.
And I'm convinced.
What do we do?
And in the modest environment.
But it's important for language.
Let's stop leaving them to the next generations.
Here's a future.
It's better.
Before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes.
I had the eyes of coffee with a worm around the IRIS.
And to say goodbye.
Well, don't forget that zoo.
After his death, reality didn't make sense.
I had to understand life and love.
Well, maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when they give us hunger.
And I felt the need to look at her seeds at the microscope.
For the surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images.
The discovery I made transformed my view of the world.
Well, the whole universe enters in my mind.
It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
It's an excellent space, without body.
It was absolute content, it became a father.
This image.
Let's see it.
And that's the image of my microscope father's seeds.
And it's another one.
It's the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection from anything or nobody.
His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project.
For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence.
Well, we are charged by the cosmos.
And that when we look at the mirror.
There is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe.
And that matter is not created nor destroyed.
It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle.
Thank you.
In Argentina.
It's imbable.
This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy.
And technology is going on.
Because their satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating.
So we shouldn't create an invad of education.
Imagine a public agency.
That designs content and strategies to transform learning.
I worked with schools.
To rewrite what classrooms happen.
That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
A agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers.
Two teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
It's a mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
And it's thinking about the state as possible.
Not like the variable of all the adjustments.
Just like that, changes in education.
That they won't benefit from masses.
(Applause) I'm not a scientist, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From big loves, extraterrestrial invations, even pandemic.
Until the fiction made reality.
And here and now, at home, we stop asking ourselves questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide.
For example, the world obsession could buy mountains of hygiene.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
But it has an unconscious logic.
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer.
It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
But it's also very unique to humans to try to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government in only 10 days.
But they hadn't only found the virus that produced the disease, but that they had sequenced their genome and had done it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology, called optimistic blind.
Think that, in fact, we don't make any of us drive or drive while we talk about phone or worse, while we send messages, the same thing happens is that many of us will not happen to us.
It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity of currentity.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but they are more social or moral.
But why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas, for example, in the Budonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
Actually, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease.
Well, in this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick with another contagi.
However, Japan has answered that everyone uses more chairs.
This first makes people who are healthy or contagious, it's very important, but there's another most important reason, which is that if they only use more sheets, they know who is sick and who doesn't use no more affection.
That they use it all over the world, it's a way to avoid self-esteem and with this.
And to take care of everything.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary capacity for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our habits, because it's impossible to change it, but it's true that education can't change and that it's of those things that are extremely difficult to change it, and, however, in three days, now all kids educate in their house.
But we don't know some consequences of this.
But we learned that we are willing to do it in the award need, and the world demands.
Also, of course, our values, our judgment.
Just two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes.
For their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people in their own.
Today, what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority.
And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a small mental experiment: it's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future?
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the atenderment.
A public consensus that includes the World Health Organization, but also to cover our public sectors, has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we are, who we find, and also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our face is viral, and it can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of getting infected and who.
Let's suppose that this consption can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way.
Those who are at home, those who are not at risk, can go out.
Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of epidemic, we don't disappear completely, but we die much less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we see it.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons we don't want to see our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them.
It's still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic and you could choose if it looks good or bad to do it?
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is.
On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values of our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic.
Maybe we have our data a little like vaccinating us.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social impact, to take care of us.
And everything.
A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom, we found a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to get to feel free?
And be careful.
Are you going to fly less in a sky?
If we change the way to greet ourselves, we'll have to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone.
We don't know it, but locked up at home.
We have an opportunity to think freely that we never want the preservative sex of the coronavir.
My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
Well, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field.
In the middle of nowhere.
It was a animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as we call it "dolars of Mars."
They are relatives from other people's erices.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago.
At that moment...
And I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
It's extremely fragile.
The dollar of Mar fell down, the sand fell.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way.
PK: But...
I'm not interested in fossils or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They continued captivating me and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one that is today: it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but what?
The whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
And I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a quantity that paleontologists do.
We mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a number.
That it doesn't enter the street.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us.
In my head.
But well.
Life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago.
I've already traveled.
Well, deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was, in different regions, like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it also led me.
A very special place.
What is Patagon?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally, we think of these landscapes, forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossil fuels.
What do they want to be discovered?
We know, fortunately, many dinosaurs of Patagonia are the last period in which dinosaurs live in Earth.
What we call critical period.
This is approximately 70 million years ago.
We know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the south hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while, at that time, in the northern hemisphere.
They added other carnivores' families, like the dinosaurs, for example.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs.
And this difference between the North of the South wasn't surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the South hemisphere of the North hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before?
At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the healing hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet.
His key increase, especially 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs for the first time dominated the planet completely, for the first time they reached giant size, for the first time, they were differentiated and conquered the carnivores of omnivores in everything.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic.
And that leads me.
One of the stories.
Well, in the discoveries we were able to do.
It's the last blood.
We found it four years ago, in hills like this, walking a lot of heat afternoon.
And after walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks, on the floor.
And I approached the idea that I was approaching.
That B was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the traffic of a dinosaur.
I got closer, stood next to me, stood up, really.
I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what the track was.
It's from a carnivorous dinosaur.
But really?
But I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life.
And then, to warn you the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task.
To protect this rest to be able to extract it.
After several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was already over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
Until the next time given the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the next expedition, we needed to open the excaution.
To see if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found.
Or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day.
From the stadium.
We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rarely.
In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions.
Clearly, the animal was dead.
A layer of a lake and it has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way.
That's it.
And then the excavation begins: reading, staying, cap, cap, those sediments that were shaking.
Where it would open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's for the first time to go back to the surface, an animal.
That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Guys, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, that they kept accumulating, until gathering meters and meters of sediments caps, and that food was transforming into sedentary rocks.
And in that same process, bones were transforming themselves into fossils for chemical reactions.
Then all that package of hidden rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming of all this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning.
That's it.
It's up to start discovering.
The layers I contained to this dinosaur at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those mistakes.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun.
Patagonic wind, it doesn't lose.
But then we were able to carry.
All this rest is protected by layers to the lab.
In the lab and the museum, another stage is extremely long, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big.
All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relative, an ancestor.
Of the dinosaurs, those carnivores of the South hemisphere, and this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before.
And that's what they thought.
Many before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, of some rocks like these, that we transported to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
Skeleton was quite complete and counted with a very well preserved meat and with some very strange teeth.
There are teeth in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "man and Dance."
For this dinosaur, it's very particular.
It's something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replication of the channel of this dinosaur, it's a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or complete skeleton, it wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end of the tail.
And this mining of dinosaurs didn't look like anything in the forms.
We found what we knew about the northern hemisphere.
Studying their rest we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same kindness, and this wasn't so surprising because if you see it in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of the Atlantic Ocean, which separates these two continents.
But we had a case again.
of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern.
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that live in this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time.
Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert.
Or in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th C.
But it was a big desert what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve.
In an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere.
It was the lack of water what had isolated these fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy.
So we are really fantastic, fascinating organisms.
They have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life.
They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing.
It's that they take us to understand chapters like this, the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Are you written in the rocks?
They graduated for millions of years.
That's our planet.
Traveling.
Every time.
Animals and plants that lived in the past while they were graduated.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years.
And life.
It occupies a prepondering place.
In this story, in the last 3800 million years.
That there are millions of pages yet by reading this book.
And if we really want it?
To know our planet.
The weather, its ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today.
And it's fundamental to know their story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
Audience: Yes.
It's also key.
To design a future.
What about us?
When I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies.
I dream of competing and containing magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small lands of terrible, without a vacuum.
Then time.
It's not a reality bathroom.
It loses subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter.
I see empathic empires, small villages, and you don't have the passion of standardmics to defend them, but something of that vocation of kids stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
Every life I dedicated myself to looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination, but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers.
The most important thing in this situation, which is the superpower of thinking better.
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
What I'm going to tell you are my ideas, I learned them from others.
And this is perhaps the main idea of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn and that our ability to think is not given or is not fixed, but that it can be developed.
Putting our mind with it.
Ideas powerful and practicing.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others.
Let's think about it.
First, imagine they enter a gym.
Look.
Those in the floor, these passengers, fixed bicycles, are measured around.
They go to the bar, they have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they get married.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't improve with this.
Well, compensating happens the same.
It doesn't count being able to think.
Because it counts to think.
We can practice thinking.
To develop ourselves is the habit of thinking and give time to think.
Intelligence is not something that has one.
It's something that is used or not.
It's been one.
What does the saying?
Those who only see a mattress see all the problems as a plague.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
And it's not about their keys.
If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing.
And if we need to cut something, we need a brain.
To have a box of tools.
With more tools it allows us to do more things, to solve more problems, and the tools of the mind are called mental models.
If we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model.
It's as if we were trying to get a t-shirt with a noise.
Well, if we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models find?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology, and also mental models, different in Japan, in Tanzania and Argentina.
There are mental models in the old Egypt for 3,000 years before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
But all the problems will seem a keyboard.
It's the third.
Little by little, I was in the club and at the table next to her son's soccer teacher, a man told her friends, "Go ahead of her son and his classmates."
For a mistake, the teacher had committed.
Man was right in everything he told his friends because he had told him something.
Let's go.
But he didn't realize it.
(Audience) What?
What does this mean?
I was creating a much greater evil.
In his child.
I was leaving it as a tone in front of his friends and I was destroying the teacher.
In front of all the kids who had to learn.
Many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning a scale.
You don't know how to have success in that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other most important scale.
To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example, money and freedom, or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, we think what's the impact we're going to do.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act?
And the principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the zoo.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impression is to have emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, now in the pandemic, many Chinese situations arrived.
But those acts didn't have impressions.
They generated emotions and they did not act.
When they started to reach Italy images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These impressions generate emotion, fear, and the fear of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what is moving.
This time we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone seemed to us before.
But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
And the practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric.
To get married is something: you have hunger.
Did you get married?
You have an immediate reward, you eat what to get married.
But cultivating is very different: it makes the effort now for something that will take advantage of for six months or a year.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
In other words, preventing us generate applause.
Because you're avoiding something.
That nobody is well-being, but except lives.
We develop our ability to act before feeling, that is to develop our ability to anticipate, it's one of the main skills to think well.
And let's think about a million.
What do we have to anticipate?
And now?
That we still feel, we live.
From now on?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last six months.
And we are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last one month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
At kilometers, we are exhausted, if we program to run 20.
Nine kilometers are unbearable.
Let's take a story of resilience.
But the key of resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last.
Have you ever met a well-known place?
You're walking through a village in the middle of the NASA, a school classmate who wouldn't do 15 years ago.
You can't create an unlikely chance to find it in that place.
To find that classmate, in that place, is totally unlikely.
But we know so many people.
So it's very likely.
To find someone in a very improbable place, in fact it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of the same life, there are so many unlikely things that happen to us something very improbable.
The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis that little of the future, we don't know what will happen.
And neither now nor with more formal times.
But we have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
And it always leaves many open doors.
Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible.
There are serious things.
Although they are very likely.
And if someone ever asks you, why do you always have cars with the stick of birth full?
Specifically, why once?
You found yourself in the other side of the world.
With a high school classmate that I didn't see those 15 years ago.
In other words, at first, what I wanted to do with this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being at the end.
To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking and people.
With which we cultivate these ideas.
Or to be able of people who enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
We try to change our own ideas.
A 40-year-old interview, the interview Domis is a question, and when Borges replied.
The interviewed told me, "This same thing happened to me."
That same question four years ago.
"Borfies, I don't know what happened."
He looked at him and said: "I ask for excuses, I haven't had much time to think about this subject for these four years."
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that makes us live?
To be accepted by new ideas.
Of the new ideas that are emerging and being always open.
Let's change.
Our way of thinking.
Women are irrational beings.
They are always given to the emotional disorder.
That's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family.
Or at the beginning of their lives?
They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of.
This phrase was in the introduction.
It's a manual.
For the education of girls and young girls about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times.
In 1915 no country in the world could vote.
(Laughter) In 2015, that is, today, 600 years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
In 1910 Marie Curie.
He won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
But France's science academic said he didn't have enough merit to be academic.
And the first woman in France, who entered the science Academy, was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here have already finished the primary.
Because university, leaving, has a very prestigious business school.
That's up to 1925, until now, 50 years ago, that's celebrating.
He let a woman do the master.
The University of Yale admired women in 1972.
The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow.
Well, this was.
This idea.
That women only serve to create children.
And he helps the husband.
It's a rational series, it's hystéric.
It was a truth made a century ago, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment.
And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they thought this idea was a truth made.
Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've experienced, the idea that truth is true.
The idea that truth is a lie, there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
That is to say, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
Two 1500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem: now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world.
It's not the world of objective.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it.
When you say that there is no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretative mark? What day is it?
On September 24th.
Does anyone doubt it?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because everything we're here is in agreement with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Ebreo, in the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, the cats live without calendar.
My dog applies to the chest and who's very lonely at home.
(Laughter) "No, by doing some misfortune."
I didn't know the time, I knew what I had become.
But don't look at the clock.
But if human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world?
That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at a apple.
He wrote the gravity law, "What a genius!"
But that's not how ideas arise.
And ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels he did, know the animals he saw, all that had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc.
Besides...
To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print.
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea.
The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it.
The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born, but it was born in the 19th century.
And the same happens with the theory of relativity, the same happens with quantum mechanics, and the same happens with what we are thinking now.
This is what we see in scientific movements, technological innovation.
They are increasingly more developed thanks to this new paradigm that there are not facts, they only exist interpretations, when we go to the economic, political and social field.
For the revolutionary change, as we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and created the children.
And yet.
And in less than 100 years they went to govern countries.
The half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that lost humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels.
How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity?
In other words, errones are monsters.
There's an idea we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half and that example to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You may say, "But how, the Greeks, the Romans, the pingüins, and all those things."
In other words, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, in all times.
And they are even documented in many animal species outside of humans.
But I had never thought that sexuality of a person.
It was anomal, as it was called at that moment.
So it determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of art.
Moral Vitorian, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak.
It's stronger than it exists, because the same thing that turns into the catholic church sex when it proves us something we want to do.
DB: You don't masturbate.
(Laughter) You're going to do it, but it's going to give you guilt.
But it's true, it's a big social control.
Isn't it?
"You don't say."
To the woman of your fellow man.
Or the man of your fellow man.
(Laughter)
It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it.
Isn't it?
And then, that is a form of terrible social control, because it dominates us.
But, probably.
On the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they tried to eat us.
We can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, the waste was created where everything that was wrong, the society of the sexual point of view, put it there.
And homosexuals during a century were terribly pursued in the whole world.
They don't have the right to talk, my right to defend themselves, the same as women before.
(Laughter) Or that Jewish.
Or that blacks, without leaving slavery, we didn't talk about when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jewish, and none of the situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century.
It's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, it's just about to get up now, and many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned.
To be frightened.
But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, for paradigm change, and because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jews, women, blacks, etc., all depressed.
They assume their identity.
They make themselves respect, and then they also understand that they are also human beings who have full right, but there's a drama of social fights, and one has to get into jail that discriminated me.
To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish.
To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, like the one who respects me as a black, only black, and the same only gay, and the gays, the women, the Jews, the blacks, we are all complete, complex people, contradictory.
So maybe I don't have to earn myself, what do I do, right?
But, however, we have to add that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
Instead of scarcity.
50 years ago?
They have to live alone.
I was a homosexual child.
I didn't know what a homosexual child was, it's more.
I didn't know the homosexual word either, and my colleagues told me, "Gordo, we're going to turn off the goal."
"Thank you, don't look at me."
I didn't know what to do, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything.
And at the same time, I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was.
And I went back home, from school, and I saw that my father loved me.
I looked at myself.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so that it come out like that?
What was it like?
I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual.
I had to become homosexual.
I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there is.
I had a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person like any other person in the world.
With the victory, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince the others that we are sexual, we are people, if we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
I'm also a person saying I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close the 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had.
It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist.
Interpretations.
(Applause) There are contradictions and babies, because it's really that, we are contradictory.
There are no facts, contradictions and contributions are also interpretations.
There are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to accept staying there to defend myself, and now I want to leave, I said.
And when I signed it, because when an idea breaks, it's that it doesn't mobilize it, while we only have it in our heads, it doesn't serve it, it says body.
I left prison and left my prison, it was so wonderful.
Do you think the State is expensive?
Ah, they told me.
That there is a list of things we need to survive, called the basics channel.
In other words, what a great idea of living constantly with this channel, Mexico, San Pedro, our community?
And it contains the things we need to survive.
What if better I had the things we need to explore?
But explore is something difficult, scary.
Every moment, person and place are completely different: the constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations.
That's a moment.
Of course or small, full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know disappears.
When everything you do, you've paid for the voices of someone else, you, you're not a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, but once you say it, you have a balance and ideas that come towards your speed.
Each moment is an energy combination, each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate, but some of these ideas are rain, and you can choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side, and in part with each one of them, decide to return, to run or run.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated, learning to harm your own movement.
A class isn't bad, with a dance class I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment and that even if life builds music, movements believe them.
There are movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing.
There are moments.
That they keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook.
Remember that I probably don't know.
It's a work of art, but you'll allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
In the formula you saw that face, when you spoke about what you loved the most, the speed is the one who went to your heart.
Or how do you start talking to you, that voice that you so much know, that you know that you probably are looking for something you lose?
DB: That voice.
Your best friend, go there forever.
Well, it will be the first to defend yourself, the first part in your pocket to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without that, it's a canasta and I can't survive.
What we created in girls' cities.
I'm sure.
And we've never chosen.
I don't have the opportunity to get rid of it.
Very naive to be.
I can't go to a state job, I can't progress in the way I would like to.
That's me.
There is always the scene.
A person, for what they were, was already in years.
Keep calm and with a bread you wake up your experience, otherwise.
Do you remember that all the time spent was better?
Is this really like that?
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
To think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of all life.
And Juancho, Franco and Manuel.
(Laughter) These photos are also there.
It's from 2009 when I saw the secondary school.
What can I tell you about my friends, that I really want them, that they are like my brothers?
And that they are three super-able people.
That, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to be able to stay like to study what they liked, they stayed here in the city.
And go to surprise, to the day of today.
They can't get a job that allows them to get closer to fulfill their dreams.
While I am in this picture, the lack of opportunities is also present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort about humans so that I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I didn't even know that if I stayed here in the city.
I could study the other, but probably the future as a person and it's enough for all opportunities.
Have you ever wondered why these things happen?
(Video) Children in full 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
In which successes and advances are with a speed that surprise us all and deprives the borders and the barriers that exist between people.
And in this context?
And cities to make more and more important cities.
Let's make sense, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2058% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would have to be almost 10 people around the world.
Seven out of every day.
If each other more people choose to live in cities.
And it means that we have greater possibilities to cry.
What does all this team explain while the city's weapons look like in time?
Others progress, they are vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them.
I'm going to tell you a key word that you want you to go to the cow when you get out of that door to return home.
It's strategy.
If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world.
I'm part of my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely for this.
To connect cities with the opportunities the world has to offer us.
It's not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
(Laughter) How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?
Through complete projects.
That improves the quality of life of the population, they avoid migration to other places, they like a better future.
Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends.
This is a photo, a few months ago, and so you can write a couple of things to start the drinks of something from the case.
Secondly, we can also say that it's given a kind of hyper-proportional relationship.
By the way, the quality of the cell phones is going to decorate.
And what we are in it, we are improving it.
Some of us have a couple of threads, others have to be on the mirror, but do you know what we share, until today, beyond the depth of this information, we have some of us?
(Laughter) The lack of opportunities.
Franco, for example, is the one that is also made in these photos.
It was a national champion of geography units in 2012.
A national champion.
(Laughter) But today, although it's left to publish a school teacher, it doesn't have time because it has to be some students working to be able to live.
(Laughter) Then you're ugly, you think my left is better, that I like to go to his audience.
(Laughter) How much did I want to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the security forces in our country?
It's like I didn't count on that possibility here, so I'm changing this rule without finding what's really passionate, and I can't get a job that allows seven economical independences.
Lastly, it's Manuel, who is a genius of illustration, but they don't know the geniuses, they give them anything.
(Laughter) But do you realize it?
All day working in their local that built from nothing itself.
It's going to college to study programming and you can't develop your potential and keep learning what you like.
Because they don't count all the necessary tools for lack of presupport to university.
Time studies programming, and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
That's it!
(Laughter) We, as young people, have nothing to make us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
That's it.
Recently, I had the huge fortune of being elected between a group of 8 young children at a worldwide level, I left the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinean in that event to participate in a week in New Day and the capital of India.
Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back.
I learned a lot, but if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following.
At 1:1pm.
There are millions that I'm never going to be able to say with enough bottles for you to understand it, but there are millions of opportunities outside for all tastes and for all politicians.
Audience: Yes.
There are discourse disorders, there's no sun.
And in one of the two.
(Laughter) But not less important, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant.
I don't have one to forget to read the youths, nor to the kids, nor to anyone.
But do you know what differentiates them that we don't have?
And there's a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them.
Once again.
If we want better cities, we know strategically the world.
I don't remember.
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could stop studying.
And with three days to fulfill 18 years.
I was very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult to leave your city than to play.
(Laughter) It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
And even today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
"Why is that?"
I don't have to go to the pocket.
My friends?
And nobody you know.
But it's necessary to give tools to our young people so they stay in their cities and they can grow from there.
In the end, who's beautiful?
To give them wings to the city you had to do.
And with a strategy, what can we do?
Imagine the brilliant who would have been white.
If I could completely dedicate myself to geography.
How much?
If today they had one of the chances of their country.
Or to not go so far away, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I like.
Is it like that?
Ah, yes!
That's it.
FD: You see the lack of opportunities.
Thank you.
DB: All of this.
What am I telling you?
It doesn't look like enough arguments.
Do you want a more example?
I'm fine.
[A.DE.]
And that's the tattoo.
And he says to me, "When, why?"
I was able to overcome the profound clinic depression.
In which I fell, I'll have to have different traditions.
(Audience) Yes!
Two suicide attempts.
DB: In numeral, psychological sequels.
He liked me.
A lot, a lot to overcome.
If we want these things to stop going.
But we have to go out strategically.
In the soil.
But we don't add a final point in our city.
I'm a surgeon.
Since always, surgeons.
We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
Well, in my last 10 years.
That's my research.
In my case, in the zoo, it was based on looking for...
Let's see the reasons.
To operate less and less to patients.
And that's it.
We can do it in several ways, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so we don't have to operate them.
Can we do it?
To help tissues to repair themselves by themselves.
They are using their own ability to regenerate.
What does this mean?
We do it with biological and maps.
What do we give them?
I went to the roof.
To use their own capacity.
And to restore yourself after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures.
And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out.
In other words, robotics is giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate this task.
DB: What's left before.
It seemed science fiction, today it's almost daily, it's hallucinating.
To challenge.
My own paradigms.
To have more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfactions.
And there are a lot of patients who avoided.
I had to make a surgery.
(Laughter) With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly invasive fears.
I have more and more time.
I'd like to share a reflection.
It's about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this one.
In which the world is living a pandemic.
I'm not a doctor.
My mom is Japanese, and in addition, in my work of many years, I've had contact with questions.
There are literary, sociological and anthropological literary of Japanese culture.
And I believe that certain behaviors and answers, social and individuals, can help us when facing a crisis like this one.
It's worth asking us a first question.
Why Japan?
I was able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage.
If in January the first case came.
I'm so close to the neighbour.
Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space.
Keeping the populations of the third age, older people in the world.
Being in the second country with more smoke.
For many inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus?
It hasn't had an exponential growth.
but a linear and identified advance.
Until now.
We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious.
In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail.
What would allow a great spreading of the disease?
Many people, in a little place, and a room of those people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is an educated society in such a way.
That responds organic and humidly to any event that compromises it.
Japan went through wars.
Tephones, your name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 temblors per day.
Generation, transgeneration.
It has had to overcome natural disasters.
Co-generated by man.
We can think of this with something that likes Argentines a lot.
teams of football as an example.
What football team will make better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do.
Or the team that never entered.
It doesn't have infrastructure and it has to go out to improvise.
And what about directives?
of social distancing, hygiene and individual behavior.
Be in society or in your own house.
The Japanese population hasn't established you for hundreds of years.
You don't need to say, you don't hug, you don't give up.
Because they don't do it.
It greets with a reverence.
Daring distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public places use a lot.
It's not necessary to recommend, to take out the shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used.
But we don't have to indicate, we don't have to turn our third on another person.
Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, Asian studies show that more than 50% of Japanese.
They will use board to feel frightened.
Not to protect yourself, but to protect others.
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
The good of the whole.
It's more important than the wind and a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience.
They made two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
You will surely know the game of the chair.
They put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and they get rid of each round.
This experience was done in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all.
Keeping the place to a classmate.
Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers.
The word " japonesa" loves this way of being.
But it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me.
In resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others.
In the example, there is a child.
But we can already see how a collective society works.
You help yourself.
Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
