When you grow up, you have to live, you have to live, you have to live in a place where you have to live, in a place where you have to live, in a place where you have to live, you have to live.
Basically, at the end of the 19th century, Friday Church.
There's the opposite tool of distant lands and music of orchestra, we fill it from the small part of the Argentine parts.
We live a vision.
To make the violin and the instrument we go, the protagonist of our popular music.
For this, we change the way we touch it, in a way that sounds folklore and can dance.
I reflect and live in Neul√©.
Each one lives in Buenos Aires, and I recommend that we had to learn to work in the hospital.
Let's call it for video.
If you steal your part, the other can play on top.
And that's how we're talking about repertoire.
Let's talk to this little girl.
That's it.
In the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
Do you know that I don't even have my suffering on suffering?
We offer the family of those who recovered us.
Once they cry, they throw them away.
But there's something else that will give me this pandemic.
I think those who dedicate us to checking the contents of social networks and fighting for that information, we were already seeing and don't worry about this new era.
During the fluid pandemic, in 2009, there was already Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global super-traction at a global level, was much lower.
The pandemic at COVI-19 is the first pandemic that coexists with infodebia.
What is infode?
The OMS, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice of spreading false and wonderful news about condemny.
We love it as a matter, because it generates panic and anxiety of people.
Disinformation is always dangerous.
We don't know.
But when it refers to health issues, it's much more dangerous because what can affect, what can put in danger is directly our life.
I don't know anything about the idea of the amount of waste in YouTube, Twitter, and of course in WhatsApp.
Maybe it's an idea, because they belong to a virus, they suffer the viralization of unbearable contents.
For four weeks, with my team, checking, fooling, we work without rest, with false truths that circulate on this new disease.
Do you know what?
We know, and we are aware that they can't stop this avalanche of information, it's impossible.
And sometimes they are frustrated.
That's why I think it's subtle that tells you what we discover, something we find.
All the contents, linked to the 19th century, can fit or classify in four categories.
I see you telling them, "You will be more prepared."
And being more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this avalanche of information that comes to us above.
How many theories are simple?
The first one has to do with connected contents to the origin of the disease.
Theories that say that an act of pioneer of two Chinese scientists steal them in Canada until a English lab created this virus in 2014.
Nothing is always.
I've also been linked to a theory that human beings create this virus, they don't take it seriously, discarte it, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus spreads.
It was the wrong reading in a scientific study of a paper that provoked that the virus lives a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media that we were not going to contagiate with only to open the window.
That's not the case.
There is no evidence of that.
The third category is the one that is related to false treatments and cure.
It's called dangerous.
It has to put more attentive.
It has to make us more careful.
It's true that taking hot water with lemon we kill glasses.
By making us garage with hot water and salt, or making vapor is to come to disappear from our body if we are infected.
It's not true that there is already the vaccine that will enhance us.
There is no Cuban sweat that managed to generate it and there is no Argentine who has already discovered the wild vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications.
At the moment, it doesn't have a completely satisfactory answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measurements.
Or to get out of different media to the opposites of authorities.
And they have further in Argentina, the day that was disappointed, the preventive and obligatory isolation 15 days ago, a little more, a false secret circulated that said that the quarantine started at 3 pm of that day.
Obviously, it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent what will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others, with those who perhaps cross you, who say that it's going to be on the Internet, not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that we are not only going so much to be locked in our homes, but communicated.
In general, information seeks to generate panic and anxiety.
That's why it's important that if you receive some of these contents that enter some of these four boxes and don't come from a official source, like the World Health Organization or health Ministry, distrust.
I want to tell you something else we learned, those we dedicate ourselves to checking, checking.
It's that we are not good with doubt, we are not comfortable when we need certainty.
And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty without all the care we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you see a content, it's not checking, you don't share it.
We replace the shared with doubts so usual: "I don't share with doubts."
That's why I'm not studying.
If you receive a container of someone, and you discover that false, you don't have streets, confirmation, and affection.
And if you share a content and then realize that false, note streets, disculpate and correct.
That's not about tons, but about living.
The dynamic pandemic.
They can be health infectologists, employees all the time.
It changes every day.
Science works intensely to get the cure, but it needs time.
Inwards, there are empty evidence and information.
We have to be able to be like a tolerate that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in the modern era when the answers were missing and the certainties we needed so much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those empty contents, because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we'll be much worse than if we tolerate them.
Thank you very much.
After 23 years, I dedicate myself to accompanying people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things: I learned that working in the middle of the pain of other people doesn't make you a person or bitter or sad.
All the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every moment of your existence and be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist.
Maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If not being able to see a miracle in an act of reconciliation, of sorry, of love or of transformation.
I learned that the sense of humor is a very powerful tool that allows you to make a parenthesis in the middle of loneliness, insecurity and fear that generates the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more in our omnipotenty to be more united and not to feel frustrated or failed when, despite having done everything possible, the result is not the one we expected.
I learned that when we are going through difficult times, it's good to see that there are many people suffering and in much more adversity conditions than ours.
That allows you to put your own perspective.
Finally, I learned and still learn that it's not just about healing.
Especially, it's about relating and accompanying.
To activate love and compassion help to face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
To activate love and compassion can leave a path of trascendence so that others can transit.
(Applause)
Good evening.
Recently, I turned 40.
After writing several novels, I wanted to write about more personal topics.
Even my pluma and after several pages, I realized that it would be inevitable to talk about my female condition, of my women's condition.
Because when a man is present, it's enough for him to say, "Hi, I'm Mr. Durant and I'm a writer."
For a woman like me, I have to decide to Buenos Aires, I'm a writer and I'm a woman.
Why should we have to introduce ourselves like this?
I had a lot to start my research on feminine condition.
It was a very written topic in many articles.
It's losing feminity, feminity will disappear.
The topic becomes fast, especially for women.
But in the end, what is feminity?
We can remember approximately that half of humanity is men and the other half are women.
Humanity's friendship is masculinity and the other half is feminity, so why do we ask ourselves to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old, they had told me that I would write a book about female condition would have surprised me.
Maybe angry?
At 40 I'm really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic, but at the same time it's so ignored.
And it interests me to understand why a woman lives her dreams, her disappointments, her different frustrations to a man.
It's enough to get into the street to see that humanity is divided in two groups that walk differently and that speak differently.
I started my research recording all the beliefs about feminity.
The myths that exist on women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete, if I wasn't going to look for the causes of these myths.
Studying more biological, physiological, technological.
I hadn't occurred to any man to analyze the peculiar condition of man in society.
The singularity of man.
It's that it doesn't have a case, the shadow is everything.
In most languages, man is both the positive side and the neutral side.
Men are humanity, the man is the whole, it's the main essential.
Love is the other.
It's the other.
Women are the second sex, the second of sex.
Women are not essential, they don't define themselves, they define themselves to receive the man who is everything.
So I followed my research, and I realized that in the history of civilization many times a group of excluded ones are created.
As blacks, excluded as the properties or the Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They tell us, they identify themselves.
However, women don't identify themselves so easily among them.
They don't say us.
In fact, a white woman will be more easily identified with a white man than with a black woman.
What if a bubble woman would be easily identified with a bubble name than with a prosecutor?
Women don't create community, women don't say "no" because they live disperse inside the group of men.
For any case, the man really likes this satisfaction to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the anti-feminists looked for theories in the religion, in the biology, to explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions, several men usually interpel me to tell me, "Are you a doll because it's a woman?"
Of course, as if I had several and a uterus and the rule and hormones would take me any objectivity.
As if they wrote their theories, they didn't have their hormones and their therone test showing them what to think.
I want to focus on these differences and understand them.
To share what I understood.
To share what I understood because women behave different from men.
And within everything I told you that studying biology and physiology, I realized one thing: that women's behavior has not been addicted by their nature, but by culture.
Nature doesn't walk all society, it's the culture that explains how we are interacting in our society.
In other terms, women are born, they get to do it.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I was recognized immediately as a writer, and at the same time I was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best in the worlds.
It was a complete, integral and integral individual.
Many women stay in their feminine because men explain to him that it's very natural for her to get married, to get excited of their husband, to have children, to dedicate them to creating them.
The name explains that it's very natural to all that, so, its feminity is summed up to that.
I don't want to change the feminine condition, for that, it's a lot.
What I do pretend is to become aware.
To raise awareness about these differences.
And to be aware that we can make decisions with no willpower.
I want to share with you: each woman and every man can and must decide what they want for their sexuality.
Especially what they dream of doing their family.
Each woman, every man, has to define what he wants to do in work.
If I want or not to work with free choice, free will.
I want to be aware that this effort has to be done together between men and women.
I want to be aware of it, so, it will have answered these questions, we will live in a complete society made of men and women completely complete and free.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, I guess you will have studied for today.
You surely know the thinking that it's a hymno in search of freedom.
A book that talks about thoughts.
The thoughts are asleep on mountains and on collines.
In the end, he says, "If these thoughts give to suffering, value."
It was something that wrote it "Verdi" and "Open to look for more than 100 years ago and we can take it as ourselves.
Are you all ready?
Also, right?
Now breathe.
But, probably, they're already breathing at home.
(Laughter) But now, because we know them, now we'll respect specifically to sing this.
"Are you in the court?"
(Laughter) (Whispering) (Audience) Hi, how are you?
(Laughter) (Laughter) He carries, let's go.
If you want to live in the world.
No, no.
All of us are happy, oh, oh, oh, yesterday.
‚ô™ Who dares to live ‚ô™ Forever? ‚ô™
(Whistles) I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to love you.
DG: Oh, my God!
(Applause)
A couple of years ago, a group of friends in my school was going to go out to mark for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my mom if I could with them.
And my mom told me no, that in any way it was very young to be there alone, that I was afraid of what could happen.
And then I told him, "OK."
If you don't have the desire you go with them, accompany me.
And my mom, who didn't steal a mark from the time of the background, came with me to Congress.
But I still remember his face when we arrived.
But he went around and told me with a smile and a lot of surprise: "Wow, it's full of kids."
Actually, we were almost all girls.
Well, the thing equals understand, right?
This, for my mom, was so surprising and unexpected, is something that today is super natural to me: to talk about politics, to say what I think, to go out to mark for what I think is fair.
They are things I do a lot.
I think it has to do with that I grew up with a almost strict diet of books and movies about teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, generous cronics.
They are the stories of my generation.
In all villages they express, that discriminate the rest, that say to be more.
And in all, there are teenagers, kids like me, who get up and fight to build something more open and free.
It doesn't surprise me at all, so the attitude I see in many teenagers is respect to politics.
Even sometimes it seems that another option doesn't leave us.
Because they educated us thinking that when you're living in a distopy, which is a dark and indesiable world like the one of those books, you have to fight to change that.
And then they put us head in a closing distopy, like climate change, where we are the youths who are going to pay the account.
Sometimes I look around and I feel we are living in one of those books.
But where there is one of those distopies, they also have to be those protagonists who reveal themselves.
In any place where a death ball has to do with Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni.
(Applause) For me, politics is not something abstract, that exists beyond our daily lives.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all the areas of our lives.
It's a culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe in what we think is good or bad.
Even the bonds, for me, have a political dimension.
It happens to me that sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobos comments or to discuss about political things.
And while many people prefer to avoid these topics to not generate fight, their uncomfortable situations, I know there are certain things that are worth fighting for.
And discussing with someone for their political position is not the same as fighting because I'm a mouth and a River's voice, that, in the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't appear, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
If a family member does a machist comment, I'm going to discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against the egalitarian marriage or the abortion law, I don't avoid the subject to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her without embarrassment.
And when we talk about a close relationship with someone, I think of these things.
If it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about the other and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say better to fall, I say "when".
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it gives us a lot of fear.
Because only talking can be built in our future and our present.
I wish, we begin to see marks and political spaces in general, not as something dangerous, what scares fear, but as a space of personal and social growth, of union and inspiration.
I hope there's always, but there's always place for teenagers.
And that you can look at yourself with pride and say, without any surprise, it's full of kids.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours every day, charging a ball like this, to take water to your house?
Can you imagine that the water that was inside was like this, contaminated, had this color?
The world crisis of water is a fact.
It's a reality that we can't close our eyes and that we'll all have to face ourselves in the future.
So they signed the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended the day by the global, climate, water, a couple of days in Marrocos.
Water is life, and without it we wouldn't exist.
In fact, human beings, we are composed of more than 65% of water, and despite that, each day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, the magnificent lagos, of the livestock of our great companies, and even of our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the result in the appearance of diseases around the world, but the direct cause of death of a thousand children a day.
1,000 children a day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world.
This means that if we choose ten people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
From that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America.
And we think this is a paradoxical way, since this continent counts with 35 percent of the water reserves in the whole world.
And if we look at some cases in particular, we will realize that in the country, for example, Peru, sorry, which is the 80 percent of the population without access to drinking water.
And that if we climb a little higher to Mexico, a border with the United States in America, where, by the way, the gentleman Trump wants to build a wall that separates more to one of these two countries, almost 20 million people live without clean water every day.
All these numbers, those looking back, made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with natural wealth is found in this situation?
It's exactly this question that made four men from Mexico to Peru, from Mexico to Bota, let's leave everything, and we want the bags and we meet again to take drinking water to thousands of people in Latin America, founded like this, by Watter Van Gogh.
Let's make the luck we've had, for having been born from a caravan car, so that we call the white jungle and, above all, garbage of a huge desire to return to the group.
During the way, we went to find rural and rural communities that rarely have water in their homes.
All of them were able to rivers, commercial votes, to be able to see.
But always with a common problem: water and pinea.
It's polluted.
All these communities usually have three days to purify theater, which, as you are, suggests a huge cost of huge resources for people who don't have age.
Done resources to buy these bidons or time resources to go look for the leg and then go.
And we asked ourselves, "What can we do to help solve this problem?"
Parting of the base that we were no expert in matter, we put our hands to the work and after many weeks of research, by filming embral forms that were perfectly adapted to the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
I see a teacher telling me.
It's a filter that works practically like a collapse.
The polluted water goes through the file, and this retains all the oldest particles that with a molecule of water... (Laughter) (Laughter) Let's stop and spend only 9% of these substances so damaged on health.
Audience: Oh!
It's a real system that is the most efficient to take water to quality in an immediate way.
Besides, it's a completely revolutionary system and we consider that it only needs the same weight of the water to make the guy work.
Can you imagine the impact of these filters in the life of all these people?
Well, now, we want to tell you a story.
It's Leo's story.
Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old young man who belongs to the 15th of October 15th in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream: to study English and end up being a teacher in his community.
But, unfortunately, both him, like all his people, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the manandial of which you were doing, was very polluted by phosas ethics around you.
At our parade, Leo was written in an English course.
It's that you can't imagine the illusion that made us, and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in these communities, in being able to fulfill, among other things, their dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well.
In total, we delivered 788 family filters and 14 community filters destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people in Mexico or Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will have drinking water during around 10 years.
And now, thinking about it here, thinking in two years ago, when Guatem√£o Project was not just an idea, we realize a little about the dream we have the opportunity to live.
But in this dream we've never been alone.
Before leaving, more than 400 people brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign which was destined to 100% to the exclusive purchasing of water filters.
And nine months later, fortunately, we didn't count for thousands.
So we have created a social movement that made the trip of these four friends an unstoppable face against water crisis.
But it's still a lot, it's still a lot to do.
But there are millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the global crisis of water can be one of the risks of the biggest risks to which human beings face in the next 10 years, according to the World Economic Forum, which is not what we call today.
So we call ourselves to ask ourselves the question: How is it possible to have reached this situation?
The reason to have reached this situation is not another that we have an information insufficient.
In the West, we have created so many necessities that all those are necessary, that sometimes we don't think about what other people suffer so that we completely satisfy all of them.
We have seen it with our own eyes.
We have lived it personally.
We have developed a project in Mexico, a lot of months ago, where we have seen how great embotelators were appropriating the commercials that supported the communities.
Therefore, they were removing them completely the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those lands, the big oil producers, the big oil?
For us all of us to win the deposit of our vehicles, what they are doing is to contaminate, is to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or spiders of the Amazon.
We have been there and it's hallucinating.
They are making communities have to move.
And in the future, what will cause probably is that it disappears to its culture.
It's really incredible and living it hasn't left us what has left us open.
It's really something that seems and we really think it doesn't affect us any of us.
I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
The world crisis of water is a reality that not only affects developing countries.
The World War crisis is a reality that 12th November 2016 is directly affecting us all and each one feels in this room.
You don't need to go very far.
In California, with a world of technological development that is changing people to consume too much water, they are cutting them into their minister for several hours.
In Spain, we also suffer drivers.
We are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the water shortage in the future.
If we really want to produce a change, if we really want to impact on this planet, what we have to do is all of us, awareness.
What we have to do, all of us, is to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we have to do is also educate all our children, of all our families, about which are the problems and real needs.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable?
What we have to do is to support local projects of our city trying to build local poths in Guatemala to overcome these communities that are unfortunately still without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise a bit of pressure on governments, who are the ones who can really change the lives these big companies that, today, of course, are not doing things well.
To appreciate and value the incredible luck we have to reach our homes, to open the glass of water, and that always drops water.
Or is it not like that?
Let's please let this resource hurt.
It seems not to us, but believe me, it's not infinite.
It's not infinite.
We have to act, we have to trust both and act, and we have to do it already.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
That's how we won't get the change we want to see in the world.
Luckily, there are many, many days to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact in other people's lives.
This is our way of doing it.
What's your thing?
(Applause)
Thank you.
Wow, how nice it is for you!
To see so many expensive attempts.
I started the conference making a commitment with you.
The essence determined that we are sources of energy and that every time we think we emit an electromagnetic frequency.
That can also be measured, the electromogmetic frequency generates our heart, our emotion.
I proved that emotion has a thousand times higher than thinking.
The electromagnetic frequency that creates a thought is measured, and when we see the frequency that emits our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, talk about the heart, I commit myself with you to what I'm going to talk about, if you open the heart, you can surely receive the 1% of what I'm going to say.
If we stayed stuck in our mind, we would surely receive one part.
So it's my commitment.
To start the conference, ask you a question: quickly, especially in front line, to put ourselves without content.
How is society today?
Raise your hand and tell me three or four answers:
Stressing.
Revolved.
Ultimately.
Aggressive.
faced.
It's an accident.
Well, in my conferences, I give up to 30 or 40 possibilities that you see me in this kind of answer.
They saw the answers that came from age, right?
And then there's another question: Is there any person in this room happy?
Raise your hand those who are happy.
Pepa, those who don't read, raise you.
I'm sure there are 500 or 600 people here, and all of you raised your hand, I'm sure that if I give you 100 possibilities that tell me how society is today, none of you has made me happy or happy.
Do you like that?
What am I?
What are we?
That's not society.
When we talk about social media?
Why do we refer to ourselves?
In the end, 100% of society is happy and happy.
And if you've always talked about more or more answers, you've told us, in that line, lost, decreased, unfilled.
Do you know what this is called?
This is called "Mente Orientado de la Crisis."
When you ask something, the first thing we say is everything we lack, everything we're wrong.
We are stuck to the media, the information where the answers that are given, sometimes we go to schools, we call them "The Day of the Day," the kids, and we tell them, "I look for the good news, bad and neutral news."
By the end of the day, right?
How many good do you think they find or how many neutral?
One, two.
Now, this is what happens to us when we naturally ask a question, a impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with sports that are fashionable.
When I ask this, what does the future say, the basket, the radio?
Well, well.
I want to tell you the fashion sports for me that are fashionable today: the first national sport: the complaint.
We complained about everything, did you see this?
The first thing we complain about the weather: checking heat that creates three money or three of the afternoon.
"Wow, how are you?"
What cold does it do?
7 am in July 7 am.
First we complain about weather, after we complain about traffic, then we complain about the country, well, we complain about my wife.
And if we don't complain about something, something goes wrong.
When they ask me, "How are you?"
It's perfectly good, it's full of happiness.
"Yeah, what happened to you?"
"Don't let you do anything?"
So we have transformed a society that is funny.
It's like a title we have.
Those we complain about everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with claim, this can't be.
What does this have to change?
This is a disaster.
If you hear what this is, you have to change the country, society, my wife, work, we're all complaining.
So we turned ourselves to claimologists.
So, that funny, complainologists and maximum, or Pinologists and allologists.
Or we look at everything.
I don't know.
Have you noticed that?
Some time they heard someone who says: "I don't feel able to do it."
Let's wait for everything, I try it with my friends.
I have a friend Fernando who uses his camera with him and I tell him, "You're packed without batteries on that floor, do you know why he rained the leaves?"
Do you know that the tone is working there?
We started everything.
We obtained the economy of politics, and something more worrying about it, we started to have our mind or to enter the crisis, we complained, and we are immersed in the opinion.
What makes us fall in a sort of vital stancing.
They have to get out of our house with the Cargado cell, 100%, and we also take a chargator for the doubts that doesn't have a lot of load, but with our energy, lower it.
We exchange the day with a vital setting, with a luck of cancer, that besides makes us lose power.
Why, because if to be fine, we need everything to change, that the country of well, that the weather is not the same, because it was little less beautiful and I came to give a conference and see with the remix and I wanted wonderful?
And the remission says: "Yes, but tomorrow it's announced rain."
(Laughter) This is how we're losing power, and there's something I want to focus on.
Besides being in this society and leaving this society, especially in our generation, that we have left, between society in a moral crisis that, in even the most perversal crisis in our grandparents, could be imagined.
I faced, I left my arm.
But in addition, we are making our children believe that we don't serve for anything, that we are corrupt, mentirous, that the model of success is the famine and money we don't have the future.
We don't really leave this, but we make them believe this.
It represents this phrase, "Hey, how are the Argentines?"
And what do you want, we are in Argentina?
Let's listen to this.
And if they were in the World Cup, what can we do?
We only leave this society as it is, but that we also make them believe in the generations that they can't change it.
A mistake.
For this, it's self-compliance.
Now, for a long time I was there and I started to understand that knowledge was important.
I graduated that ability was important to get out of that world in which I lived.
I lived complaining about it, I was a hell.
Because talent was important, it had to have talent, experience, and each one formed me more in this, that all of them joined, everything joined.
So I looked for more knowledge, more ability, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add, but the attitude multiplies.
A multiplying attitude.
And you know that all singing is 0.
You, the attitude you have in front of life, that's zero, that's a kind of being.
And you have that negative attitude, that's a negative type.
You have a pessimistic attitude, that's a pessimistic guy.
And if you have a merda attitude, it's a kind of merda.
So I started to say, "How do I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position?"
The first thing I saw is that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed.
I had a decision to change the attitude and which was to get out of that victim state, that I had of everything that happened to me, and I started to decide to be the protagonist of my life.
I started to decide who was going to look for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's posture, I was justifying, criticizing, complaining about it, and I started to prove what happened as a protagonist, and the first thing I saw is that the scalid protagonist is a subway.
Well, this square meter I have depends on me.
Each one of you has a meter, depends on you, from nobody else than you and me.
And do you know what?
Here, in this square meter, I live in the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why I go with a shirt that says "I respect."
It doesn't matter what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to contagiate you from the example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to decide to live in a different world.
Because living in hell I went through hell.
I hadn't remembered an exhibition, and I told him, "Miss, three reasons why I would have to keep living."
It was very bad.
I was in the nurse and I lived in the paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
Besides, I live in love, full.
But hell and paradise is not a place, it's a decision.
Because the hell I have it there beside, tomorrow I can return from it to decision.
Where I pay to see everything I lack, not everything I have.
And where I start to complain all the time and operate all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter vibrates as I want.
And you know what you do, but it's also what you stop doing.
If all the time we're waiting for someone to change this, we're going to be in the oven, many facts, that is, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
Not all have the same possibilities, we all have the same possibilities.
I started educating, they say there are many ways to educate.
For me, a single one with the example.
Every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, this is the way to educate.
Being the image we want to see.
Starting with our square meter, we have to emit energy first, main characteristic attitude.
I'm the protagonist of my life.
I'm the one I want to change things.
Because the protagonist of that change agent is not waiting for someone to come to solve their lives.
And from my master's square being sympathetic, starting to emit optimism energy, because you know what with the people you gather, you contagiate.
And you're with a group of pessimist pieces, it's a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, that's a failure.
If you take a group of unhappy, that's unhappy.
If you start your square meter, to contagiate solidarity, optimism, you begin to emit that energy.
Because what energy does your square meter have?
From wherever you are.
The important thing is not what we do.
The important thing is that what we do, we do it with all the love of the world, in peace, it was to buy a ice cream, it doesn't matter what, to not be advertising.
And I say to the girl: "Paris Pascuas, and he tells me: 300 people went by and I the first one that tells me happy is Pascuar, and I said to him, "Go to the 300 happy people, P√°scua."
No, I said, "What are you doing?"
What are you waiting for?
What are you emitting?
I've got stuck, what a myth!
What are you going to do?
What does it look like?
"Let's put into account."
Little gratitude.
It emits love and encounter.
What is that mythend?
What does it do?
It's like a source of energy and what you put, it's what you receive.
This is like AM, FM, if you're in AM and you go from a AM to the other end, you're going to listen to Radio AM, now if you change your frequency, you go to FM, there's another melody, and it's more in FM, there's another frequency you want to hear, you can choose.
But if you're on the top, because you're going from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that, that is, the world is how we create it.
They were going to the paradise, but the hell is a decision.
If I start to say, "The first match I play against myself," "Well, I get up, I don't get up," "I don't get up with bad humor or with good humor."
A bad humor, or not, with good humor.
Well predisposed, badly predicted.
Everything I have or see everything I need.
They are all decisions, they are all small differences.
The excellence, or the media, is this difference.
The path you grab is a Greek.
Since you get up, your victims and protagonists.
You're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come or make the interests that you're governing us and taking from domestic analysis.
People drive it for fear.
My father told me a huge heritage.
I always told myself, "Shut up and fear, I've never had it."
Well, let's form, no, we are increasingly safer.
And I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this fundamental foundation, which is the great blessing.
I invite you to see it, I invite you to know what I do.
The week went by, we gathered the veterans of Argentinian War and Vit√°nic War came to a Russian Marim British, with Hungar, and they gathered Argentine competers and together they gave a message of meeting.
Because nobody says no.
And do you know who to close the conference?
It's my 12-year-old nephew.
Do you know what he said?
land forbidden, which unity of measures is that.
They taught me that they were the bad guys, and now I see that bad guys suffered as good as well.
"No."
Our generation has to understand that war is not a tool.
That year, it was born in the middle of the second.
I invite you to see it.
I'm going to tell you two stories of life that I had the blessing of living with the Foundation Ralco and without Borders.
In 2012, I went to work in Tanja de Gaza, a conflict between Israelis and Brestinian who took 70 years.
A place where I took care of, I thought I was missing a lot of things, and I understood that all the time I was worried about what I needed.
One morning, I see that a lady from the city of Bel√©n came and hugged with other ladies and celebrations, there is no celebration.
So I say, "What are you celebrating?"
So, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank.
What does this mean?
It has drinking water at home to take every week.
If you're celebrating them, their family will be able to name water.
They celebrated it.
Isn't it?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy asked him, "Do you know what the genius is in the radian lamp?"
Everything through the translator, right?
I said to him, "No, I don't have any idea." So I'm going to explain what that genius is in the lamp for the lady and I tell him, "I have a desire."
What did I ask myself?
And this looks at me all excited and says, "Go to my hot water bathroom."
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment, all the time I was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had to think if I had water to drink, if I could give a bathroom, I would have to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude.
I stopped being in the world of the lack, I was in the world of the mountains and I realized everything I had.
To conclude this, I want to propose an exercise.
What if we are now in this state?
It will have three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes, to all of you, to close your eyes, imagine at this moment all the things we have, that we never give value, we don't give them importance, like the fact of having a place where to sleep, to be able to bathe, to have water.
To start doing a mental list of the things we never realize and thank us.
Like health, as the possibilities we have, like our senses, our friends.
These things we give them by sitting, but we never list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with all the people in this room have been sold or selected or chosen for everything they have.
All the people who feel a deep gratitude for the state of things they have done until this moment, who express that gratitude, supporting their feet, applauding the strongest they can shout doing what they want.
They express the gratitude they feel for the things they've received in their lives if they feel it right now, from this moment.
(Applause) We are in a very well-being moment, with the protagonists that we can be in our lives, or the abundance we live with, or the love of our loved beings.
(Applause)
This is the gratitude, we have to express.
Everything we have, well, stay there for a moment, the longest path to travel is four palmadas when we manage to move from our heads, we connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we can realize everything we have, but not everything we need.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place, but a decision.
We managed to turn off the turtle for a moment.
And now I'm going to ask you to push this moment when you're going to give a shower and that from there you realize that we can choose the path where we're going to transit, if we go to the hell or if we go to the paradise.
Thank you very much, good afternoon.
Musicizing is to wake up the inner world and share it with others.
It's no longer necessary to be an instrumentist or to be a musician to live music.
Do you know why?
Because music is already in us.
Since we are born in latest, in pulse, in rhythms.
The sun comes out, the moon, the life of my life, but also the music of life in the pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds.
Where we are little and we play with the sound as if it were toys.
"Dad Pach until we grow up and we carry music with us."
And it also generates bridges.
It generates alliances between institutions, families, schools to be able to go together and grow in a community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
so that we can give us the welcome of asking ourselves through games and songs.
Welcome to the talk!
(Applause)
Clearly, it's not easy to face such a sea of people.
Imagine then what Bullying must be.
bullying, those physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as a school support.
One of the most discussed and serious problems of recent times, our social problems, however, five or ten years ago, I think that few or none of us have heard this word, bullying, even if we just appreciate it in our own meat or because we contribute to managing it against our own classmates.
Before, it was called "to take a point to someone to get bored," now it's said bullying.
But I think this happens now and that we call bullying is actually something new.
You have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same.
And this is for several reasons.
First, before we didn't have a word to name it, to name the phenomenon, or at least it wasn't this bullying word.
Notice, they didn't discuss it in the media, they didn't try to promote laws to coexist it or to penalize it.
Of course, it could be a reason of suffering for many people and, in fact, it was, but it was thought it was something more or less normal, an indexed consequence, an indexed effect of school coexistence, but not so serious.
Some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, and in that same time, that is, until recently, other school grams considered much more serious than those balls without importance that occurred in recreations and halls.
I mean the demonstrations, the exulsions, even the bad grades.
Both children, like teachers, parents and general societies, thought that was much more important than what we now call bullying.
Although now, at the same time, it tends to be the opposite, the bad grades and disciplinary rawings seem to be increasingly serious, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying occupies a more central role.
So there are simultaneous and complementary movements that happen at the same time.
On the other hand, these traditional reasons of school humiliation, which are the most applied castigos for an authority, like a teacher, or a directive, something considered incorrect, something for the regulations, or something considered that shouldn't be done.
These castles that the same students apply between themselves for the most diverse reasons, but almost always related to physical or the personality of the victim.
If this is happening, the question would be: Why?
Why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a great historical change about which it's worth thinking.
And we think that on the one hand, in those collar humiliation reasons, those most traditional conflicts, demonstrations, exulsions, bad grades, what operates there is guilt, guilt for having done something bad.
Culp is an internal, private emotion, it is referred to a moral conflict, a drama of each one with themselves, to have done something that not only regulations say it's forbidden, but I don't have to think that's wrong, even me.
I feel guilty because I did something bad.
In the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's in play, but another type of emotion: embarrassment.
It's not exactly the same, it's quite different.
The embarrassment is a public emotion, it is not referred to a private drama of each of us, in fact, something bad.
In the case of embarrassment, the problem isn't me, but the others: the gaze of others that judge me in an un correct, unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond having the fault or not having done something bad, in general, I don't have anything fault, it's the others that exercise on my cruel look.
It's a transformation, and I think this is a key to understand why the shame is, and I think this is a key to understand why our priorities are changing.
Because it seems to me that the genius look, the other's look, that obviously was always important, ultimately, won a weight dismissured, uncomfortable, especially at the moment of judging who each one is and how much it is worth.
And this wasn't always like that, that's why I say it's a great historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, that it's not from now that it's managing, it's decades, and that it's about consuming now, it's crystallizing now.
One of the most important ingredients of this transformation is the abandonment of the idea of internality.
That's it.
In front of a fundamental belief, during the 200 years of preceded us, and the 19th grade, the conviction that the inner life was defined by each one in a much more profound and true way than the apparences.
The appearances don't only consider themselves bananas, but also false, frivolas, like something less, something without importance, compared to all the contundence of that truth or inner beauty.
All of this are values and beliefs that remain between us, but that we are abandoning them.
For example, in the case of the apparences, it seems pretty clear to me that they are no longer so good, we think of the phenomenon of the body that was developed in the last decades, of the importance of the personal image of the physical aspect, the subject of gyms, the aesthetics, all that.
It also matters a lot, and each time it's more simple, it's what you see.
It's also asked for that notion that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see, but that are not the tribes inside each one, but that are not the immaterial trips, like the soul or the spirit.
We believe less in that, and more in what others can see, what we show what we do, and, according to these transformations, we judge us from that notion that there is something inside eternal, half-dictorial and antiquated interiority that would be more true than the actions and the appearances.
Together with this, a series of transformations appear, and one of them would be the self-comotion, the technical attacks of self-production that are everywhere, and that, until recently, would be considered something bad taste.
Let's think as an example: the conquest, the obsession to conquer the largest number of followers or likes, this also to prove that someone who exists and has value and that deserves to be looked at me.
The phenomenon of social networks could also be seen as a test of this transformation: the success of social networks on the Internet.
I take a set, an infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries, going through the reality of shows and bullying.
I think that thinking about this broader context doesn't surprise that today bullying has already transformed something so serious, so serious, when demonstrations and bad grades are increasingly less serious.
It seems that the fault lost a good part of its moralized efficacy.
The fault is no longer as effective as embarrassment to produce effects in our lives.
This, of course, is very complicated, because there is a management, a administration of two verts that seem contradictory on one side, we have to show ourselves, others have to see what we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and dissolve our image.
But on the other hand, it's always the risk that this fair look doesn't give us admiration, but rejection, burst, ignorance, as well as ignorance.
We don't become more vulnerable to the agenda, for that same reason.
We're also in the complication, cyberbullying, when these bubbles or disseminate to the group of acquaintances or protected by the walls of the school or the house, suddenly, are exposed to millions of people.
Everybody knows it, so embarrassment is terrible, not much more serious, and we don't have where to take refuge, or inside oneself, or intimacy, or even dreaming of escaping an island that, every time, there are fewer or there are no more, at least, no equality.
It seems that this idea that hell is us, is more true now, in the era of permanent connection and of the profiles, always visible in screens, and with this dependence that we develop with respect to ourselves.
And if all this is happening, in fact, this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do?
This is better or worse than before.
Is it good or bad?
How do we solve it?
Because the bad news is that I don't have a solution, but I think I have some clues.
It seems that both guilt and embarrassment are social control mechanisms, and the fact that guilt is losing a good part of its living now and that embarrassment is magnificating, that's not good or bad in itself.
But it's something we have to have in mind, that is, it's a data, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
Think about that what he wanted to tell.
Thank you.
(Applause)
If we talk to my children at home and I tell you we were living a historical moment, that we wouldn't forget these days.
When he told me, "Mom, I want to live a historical moment, but the good ones."
I work to research on education and I feel that the pandemic put us to the force, in a kind of global educational experiment that is forcing us without wanting to explore what happens in a hyper-connected world in which we can't go to physical school.
Today I'm thinking a lot about that.
Is there something we can learn from this educational scenario and we don't choose?
And I think we are learning some important things.
And I would like to share with you these ideas that are walking around these days and that I hope, in one of those, we are part of the education of here, in front of me.
The first time, for the first time, all of us and all of us have the urgency of animals to find new ways to teach.
Innovation is something that comes to talk about closing.
It was that until now they were happening isolately, separated.
On the other hand, we all, in simultaneously, had to help us give a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency, those who dedicate us to teaching, we are having to redesign our classes to distance and in that process we are encouraging new ways to do things.
And for that, we realized that there was no way to reinvent the wheel.
There were many things that were already available, but we had never had the urgency in periods of need to use.
Storial Greeks, books in line, remote learning platforms, social media, video calls, whatever will help us to keep teaching, and especially to keep connected with students, with families, that are in these days, but so important.
And the good news in the middle of all this, I think, is that once we test them, we use them, these strategies already start to make samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tools box.
Little by little, in the middle of the frustration that brings, we have to adapt them so fast, even trying patients to do the same when things don't go out, because we're also learning, we're going to grab the taste, to try new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching the girl what they know.
Through yoga classes, even workshops in tissues.
Even people with vocation of teaching are encouraging to do it, as they don't know if they come in these days, they taught themselves bigger than they started to show how to be the compound to make banks, those people of their age.
We are learning in community.
The second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
In an investigation we did last year, we asked teenagers to imagine the ideal school.
Like something that appeared once and again.
The kids and girls told us that the school I dreamed had a space, at least in part, to choose what to learn when and how.
Suddenly, today, for another, that's happening.
Many days, many families began to realize that many times kids, especially with only teenagers, learn better when they manage to organize their own times.
Some study more at night.
Others start with the subjects that interest us the most.
Others connect with classmates to make a task.
Or a change in the web to try to understand something that doesn't come out.
Or to learn something new that they had desire.
This also helps us think about the education of here, in front of us.
Because it makes us see that these autonomy moments of children can be combined with other distances in which we are all together working on the wall.
And it also tells us that for all children and girls to take advantage of those more autonomous moments, we have to teach them, since very young people, to organize their tasks and everything they want to learn.
Because in my last reflection, in these days, it's more a question: What happens when we don't have the physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is achieving that we realize it, but not in a theoretical, declative way, but in the body, in the value of school and the huge task they are doing and that they do every day.
When kids and girls can't go to school, they appear stronger than ever, their need as a space that guarantees everyone to learn.
When we try to accompany our children in school tasks, I don't know if they're going through these days, we realize how difficult it is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever the differences between the home.
It's not only the one with a computer and the one who doesn't, the one with the Internet and the one who doesn't.
It's the one who has a calm place to study and the one who doesn't, the one who has here in question, and the one who doesn't.
It has to be all care tasks of the house and those who don't.
The school, with all its difficulties, during a few hours a day, at least, put between relatives and inequalities and helps all kids and girls to be protected and focus on learning.
And the educator worries a lot how all this will be.
And I also ask myself what is left of what we are learning in this quarantine.
The feeling in these days is... When the sea breaks, and the beach gets naked.
Among all that marriage, what breaks, what is carried, also on the beach some treasures hidden.
Hopefully, as my son said, "This historical moment is not for anything good, it helps us make those treasures we are finding."
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach, to replicate the use of time and learn.
We also realize how much we need as a society of school and teachers.
Today, physics are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to build, among all of this, when all this happens, the education we dream of.
Thank you very much.
In fact, I dreamed that the quarantine lasted for two months.
Suddenly, we used to live like this, that the doctors operated by medicine, the patient at home, the doctor in the suit rays, X-rays, the kitchen and good nights.
Education to distance worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up to 7M to study sleepy media.
I had to be the workers of the State understood by Philm, the functioning of Bubble Drail, finally, that the mythomans and the chisms were revolved in the diffusion of conspiranous news through social media.
And that those who before buying funds, pans, engineers shared those lies with their friends.
And all the businesses worked for displayment and dream.
It could be voted from home, but not only four years ago in elections for president, every week it could be voted from home.
Sport, yes or abortion, no.
We appreciated a button.
She marked me in the book "Yes" or "No."
We applied a button.
We all said what seemed to us and then the majority was always gained.
One day for the other, quickly.
Doctors, northerns, scatoric disputes, deciding the place of people.
I knew Iglesia was also online.
The Nisa gave them the cure for YouTube.
And of course, it was forbidden to emit them by Youton Kirls.
I had to make an algorithm supported to lawyers and judges, and that one day for the other, all those who had a right had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I didn't have to visit the world through public and art.
And that in the end, we used to buy the businesses of the neighborhood and make the line on the street, already automatically by Augusto, always keeping a meter and a half distance with the following.
When we saw a neighbour, we greet them with the code.
We had to become monogams, but really.
And the single people were looking for a love in the neighborhood and they started to live because the same as before we hated loneliness.
I dreamed that the soldiers who didn't want to live with anyone respected them because we realized that they thought all day in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that the addicts had recovered.
That they did addicts to something else.
So TED talks had to do them from home and do them from home, and they didn't last 18 minutes, but they lasted 6.
I dreamed that the State sent us a 3D printer to each one, to be able to buy important products.
I punished that at night, in the big cities, they came back to see stars, they were dots like in the field.
And that in the field they proliferated, suddenly, wild horse and logos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later, the government announced the end of the pandemic.
And a very short communicated, the president told the town that it was already possible to leave the street, that it could be normal life.
What do you say to the President?
They occupy their jobs, leave their homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that a avestruz crossed the nine of Jurio and that we all went out like crazy at the street and we would run to the avestruz to make us a selfie with the animal.
And that without wanting, we fixed it and killed it.
And there was a intriculating truck, shocked against the green framework of the avestruz and returned.
And they fell from the truck filled with wine cardboard.
And there would be more people at home, to take selfies with dead abyss and steal the wine.
There were shouts and immediately someone punished to another.
And the journalists appeared that were removed to transmit the greatest.
And then, over jumped, I woke up and discovered that we kept in quarantine.
And I felt better.
I think that when you see a picture, sometimes there are people who are a little more beautiful, but who appear a little more ugly in the picture.
Or people who are a little more ugly in the picture and who look more beautiful?
That fact, I always call myself a lot of attention, because if you think that photogenics exists, it means that photography can't end with the portrait in vivo, it can't be displaced.
I started actively drawing.
To give you the idea of that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
What did I embrace that challenge of seeing with detainment, of indaging the etymology of the gesture?
The visual etymology of what you are capturing.
And the idea of knowing helps you see what you have in front of you.
And that's when I go from a walk or visit a place with little friends on Facebook, that we draw.
We use it as a lab and we prove that a line is a point that came out of walk, that the eye is a very subtle lens and that, to understand the invisible, we have to look at it with definition, visible it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom how much I thought I could get to know a person from their social networks in only 30 seconds.
Ponco told me.
And that's how I felt that party and I suggested to prove it.
If I got to know at least ten things of a person, in those 30 seconds, I would eat the last or myth with a weather that breaks my life.
Imagine my illusion when he accepted.
I put the cranometer and I went direct to Instagram.
I created a lyrics and entered the first profile that appeared.
Let's start until now.
To see what that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, more or less a month ago, had climbed a photo with the windows of the number 18.
Besides, there were a lot of people, family, friends, Gachi Pachi, all singing the complete happy.
So I supposed to be a very friendly person.
But in these publications there were some art pieces of bank.
I said, "There's this girl who likes art."
Something that can later confirm with some photos she seemed to paint.
All of that went down, I kept moving down and discovered that those who are usually their best friend.
What is a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design?
And among all that, I could also see that it's a very healthy person who attacks the milk and covers it, that is, it's very respectful with the environment.
But when these ten things had spent 28 seconds.
My mom was very shocked.
I couldn't believe I could know a person like this from social networks.
And it's true that in networks each one chooses what they want to show.
Not because it's there, it means that it's something 100% real.
Even so I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
And I believe that today there is a fundamentally different way to know other people comparing how we did a few years ago.
Before, everything I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To give you a general idea of that person, to know details.
Today, thanks to social networks, that is to say that this became completely, and it's the opposite, and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can know the first details of the person as their personality, their tastes, their families, friends, and then with all that, to make a general image of the person.
And I understood this way, what is more than what I do in my first impression.
Generation is tolerant, multicultural, and it has a lot of social and environmental concern.
And this is much more powered in social media.
An example is like with the girl I found in Instagram.
I didn't judge her to be trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to show her reality.
On the contrary, finding and what I see on the other helps me question what I'm seeing in the world.
I can do this kind of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications called my attention, like the ones I spoke about to take care of the environment.
I also started to ask myself, "What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if that's how I'm going to do it?"
When I spoke to my mom and I was very funny with a cream, we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds are transferred to our daily encounters.
And that's when I realized that this different way of getting to know others, which in social networks, passed the screens and is present in my daily encounters.
My behavior in the real world, that's how to say it, changed completely.
I found myself with a person I don't know, I don't search for a label to frame it.
I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those of those I mentioned at the beginning.
I ask everyone and without judging.
And obviously, I ask her to use the networks.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Even if you think about the attention of this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face think they're looking at?
Can they be aware of how their eyes move in this image?
Do you know first what you see after?
Surely all of you will have happened at some point, for the eyes, for different parts of the face, somewhere have been defined.
Indeed, some artists, like Alberto Jacometi, or Leonardo da Vinci, knew that the pores and details were fundamental elements to build what we would call the look of a portrait.
It was as if, in some way, these architects knew which parts of the face they looked for.
To elaborate a portrait, to put evidence in subjectivity through the constitution of a look.
And at the same time, she is looking for the other, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what it would be if we can see how a spectator looks at.
In a positioning team, in a neuroscience lab, we put several portraits in many people and registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image in the weather.
How to extract information, since the rest constitutes it in the brain?
We saw all the images, all the gazes together in the image, we could see what relevant parts are when we stop the portrait and which is not.
In some way, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that gaze, of the portrait we talk about, and the look of the spectators.
It occurred to us to think then how a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks, all together, the look of others.
We built it, that's what I'm showing you today and that I wanted to share with you.
This very brief trial for the record of an eye is, in some way, a strict of some of the projects that took along with Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think in a way like a trip, a trip through different landscapes, postumes, languages, in which we transit with some maps of art and several leaves of route of science.
But, fundamentally, what encourages us is the search of the stake, the questions, the exploration.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
At the exact moment we are born, we started to agree.
Aging is the flow of life, the most natural process of human beings.
However, it's the most resistant.
We invest so many resources in living more and more years, and even so it seems it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why? Because we don't know
A few years ago, when I started working in the subjects of longevity, many people asked me, "What are you, young people, taking care of old people?"
And that's my future that I answered.
Who knows how to live many years and so I'm going.
That they didn't say at that moment, and it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved with this topic: "It's fear."
Fear to be old.
First, fear of living in a society where the most important thing is to be or to seem young.
Fear that my knowledge and my experience are losing value, that my word hasn't been taken into account.
Fear to stay in the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
The discrimination for age is the most extended in the world.
And the older women who suffer the most.
Besides, linked stereotypes continue to be socially accepted.
We can see in advertisements, in the workplaces, in the jokes we do.
But the worst of all is that we don't even perceive them or let them happen.
These stereotypes fit older people.
We have some generalizations that all put in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
Just the data of the social debt tells us that 70% of older people, today, in Argentina, are self-valid.
That is to say that they can take care of themselves and take care of others.
This belief shared that the elderly are sad or depressed.
When 80% says being happy.
And that is much more than what the people of my age manifest or even younger.
Or this passive class label.
And what's going on?
Who just seems to me that definition?
That they don't represent so many greater people who are working are creating, are taking sports, taking part in volunteers, taking care of others.
Stereotypes are very powerful and they have a huge impact in people's lives.
Because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute that you think of a person taking a super innovative project, do you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a 65-year-old person to get a credit or a funding for their project?
Even when it's shown that projects where older people have more successful probabilities.
However, I never found a scholarship or an opportunity for funding that included them.
For example, the empty that exist in the health field.
Most public universities in our country don't exist the geriatry matter.
Medicine students are formed to treat young adults, not older.
Everything related to aging is just a topic in general clinic.
Maybe that's how we are preparing for the new longevity we suffer to get?
What's happening with university teachers in any field.
The 70s are invited to take away from age issues.
Who defines that chronological limit, every 69 can give class and at 71 no?
The media are not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, in a meeting with a national media, I asked them why, every time they treated older people, they used the same photo.
Perhaps of the older person in a plasma bank, giving them to eat the 'Palomas'.
Well, what do you see?
And the only thing we have in archive was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images we lack words: older adults, third age, old, old are the traps, I still don't find a word that identifies or conforms to everyone.
The only one that suggests to avoid is grandfather or grandmother.
I think they are their grandchildren, of course.
(Laughter) It's because of affection some justify.
And if it's by affection, I could tell myself "mamita" because it's a woman in reproductive age and it doesn't correspond.
Most people have a name like everyone.
Our stereotypes shut them, exclude and go back invisible to many.
Today, in Argentina, there are 6 million older people over 60 years.
In 2050, there will be more than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an aggressive society.
And we don't want to see ourselves or accept ourselves.
If we assume, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, to create jobs, to design new products and services.
In this new longevity there are endless doors so that we rethink the next years in the economic, in social and cultural.
I'm going to give you an example.
In this country, one of three older people says that it's a need for recreation and entertainment, they're little or not satisfied.
Because if they had the opportunity, they would keep studying and forming themselves.
However, the offices and education that exist are thought almost exclusively for children and young people.
And almost these opportunities we can't detect them intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very different group that doesn't respond to traditional patterns that we still have in our heads.
Besides, many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal is that we listen and learn from older people to really understand their new possibilities, desire and tastes.
A while interviewing a older person, I wasn't clear if I wanted to be activities with people of their age or with more young people.
And I asked him, "What do you want?"
But being in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to add our stereotypes and contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
My parents are us and those we are going to do.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
