I have a message for their children and grandchildren. I need you to help me swim. It's very simple, do we need it? In other words, learning to feel, thinking and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself in the Lombocan Street, Indonesia, at 30 meters below water, with that feeling of ungratulations, of tortugas, of mold fish, at that moment, I observed a small fish. Are you fragile? And blacks and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me. We were looking, right? And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself. It was a very spiritual feeling, and what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, it's the same thing my students think at the university every time I tell him, look at each other. And they say, "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy. That's it. And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. He works 24 hours during a week. To draw that artwork we're going to see or, on the contrary, the maritime currentity has awareness and that I don't blame it. And if I'm able to talk to fish. Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena, I think yes? Last year, the Science magazine published a study, scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between predators, that is to say, for every four bottles there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? Paradoxically, in amazing forms, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology. I agree with the law of Claiver, an elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse, doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse, but three rooms. And if they stop thinking about it... So I ask myself, is it a mere coincidence, the planet we live in or really nature has an inherent consciousness? After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution. That was the problem that led me to study the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being, I realized that nature has the beginning and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here it brings a resume. (Applause) And I remember, with the scientific consensus, with the explanation of the first very simple life, with the Parition of oxygen book in the atmosphere and the miracle of life, between 3800 and 500 million years, the planet Earth was formed between 4,000 million years, with the complex exclusion, the trophic chain. Thanks to fossil remains, until now, it's known that autropitecos have about 4 million years ago, the homo near of T-Terralis, the only survivor of the human species, that coffe, didn't get to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago, it started the Egyptian period of its rich biodiversity. (Laughter) From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years ago, the human being is adapting the environment in a transcendental way. But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed, as something unbearable. It's between species. In a 30-year-old Parliament, or maybe 100 million species, a single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of the species, and that's if it's crazy, and we are all responsible. Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs, but the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him. This half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them; if it seems we have forgotten the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, teaming the thermal fusion of stars that can reach the 65 million degrees of degrees, and that's why it was little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological spider we leave in the breast, our mother Earth. In the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth. QD: Since 1990 to the year 2020 we'll predict that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity. According to the World Forum of nature? But we don't have four planets, it's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think, if all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and the lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours, and act in harmony with nature. Besides, the use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and carbon, has generated a big global warming, and what does this mean, imagine that we close the doors and the windows in which you are sitting? PK: Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. Darwin told us that only survives the strongest, the ones who adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation. If it's true that there is violence and predation and excess in all forms, in life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it. It's not competence, but cooperation, I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running fighting, competing to reach an egg to fertilize it. What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation. For example, soccer, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it. Our body is a pluricerular organism where millions of cells cooperate, but nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is lost in time to suffer from linear thinking. We've sent garbage to the outside space and recycled political systems, like anarchism that failed the communism that also failed socialism, and that's how it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and for their children. And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. And it's something that's inside all of us, we all have this faculty, and I invite you to make a game. How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us from imagination, what happens to them with this ship? Well, they occurred to them to make a plane. What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"? Well, the Japanese did the train Bala. And with this "Murcié Lago." We could make a trunk, right? And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites, we could make bioclimatic buildings. And with this is Girasol. A plant of solar boards, as we know, there are millions of species in nature. Bio-inspiration is practically infinite. But we keep thinking that nature will always be there, and many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and climb so much percent of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started for the industry, and imagine a future dialogue with our children and grandchildren, I would like us to think if we don't do everything that is in our reach, at least, we try it, fight. PK: And you. And what would you like to hear? Thank you very much. What I have to do is that 40 years ago we learn the pain of the respect, thinking about entering, it's an idea in which I've been meditating from a book, we've always succeeded and we're going to keep doing it, we're going to do it wrong, we learn it badly, socially, and that it's a great moment to learn, it, it's a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment. And what impressed me was that for him, as a person writes, and then he decides to take care of a garden, not like now that we spend the mouse cooking, but what he decides to guide is that he's going to buy a dirty ground in a horrible room, and he's going to take his passion for childhood to the bakery, three times, which, in fact, after his diagnosis, is very important, some of his diagnosis. Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks you've experienced are those." And it's even more, because we don't do it as an excrement, that the reproductive work has a reproductive value and reproductive value, that is something that doesn't make you special, it makes us original, it's not important, it's an important thing, but in general, because the productive work, it's a productive work, it's a productive work, it's a productive work, it's a productive work, it's a productive work, it's a productive way, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, and it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's now, it's not easy, it's easy to do for us to cook, it's to cook, it's not to cook, it's easy to cook, it's to cook, it's to cook, it's to cook, it's to cook, it's to cook, it's to cook, to cook, it's to cook, it's a lot of course, We think it's the opposite, even if it's the care tasks, it's the most important ones: hundreds of days we're living without advertising, without writers, without a lot of things, even without powerpoints, and the world keeps spinning, but the world doesn't go spinning without food and without health. That's why, in fact, I want to go back to my life, because that's why I thought that the relationship of care with our bodies we also need to live them in a very strange way of thinking about something that has already existed in the natural world, that we are involved as human beings, that we are not mechanical, we can write them, but we can also live them in a very strange way of thinking about what we have to do with our bodies in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, in our bodies, we can't, we can't be very strange things that we can also be very strange things that we don't have a very strange, we need more novels, we need more novels, we need more novels, we need more novels, we have novels, and that we have no longer, we have no longer, we have no longer, we have novels, we have no longer and we have no longer, and we have no longer, Thank you very much. People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat: no more bread, no more sweet, no more posters, a end of the middle. These foods don't bother, what fat is the form of dismissive and disordered and disordered in which we consume them, but that's why I want to name three key aspects to have a good food, the first is consciousness. Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness is secondary to brain activity," and with brain activity, I lose experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if the consciousness rate to our desires we would never choose a food we didn't want to eat, but the opposite, the one we liked the most. And after this, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating and in what quantity. A good data is not to go to the super with hunger, it's hungry of everything, it's hungry, it's not blood of manzen, it's hungry of everything, it's hunger, and the desire to move to that or to those food we wanted to eat. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most tempted. The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas. B, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double weight. So? Going back to the subject, we are really able to say "pixa", "No thank you," I prefer a "guarddol." Impossible, right? Well, the second aspect is practice. To eat, like every process in life, is learned. And in this case, and in many cases, I include myself re-aprends. We must learn to eat in station, what does this mean, to eat the food that have been harassed at that time. Well, this will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and putting a god in our health. Because foods are made of their own, of their time. They are the most natural foods, that is, they are not addicted with calories, they are the richest food in nutrients, or it's normal to see fruit all year and necessary for our body, and they are not treated chemically to subsist in time, or it's normal to drink tomatoes in winter and summer. So this mechanism has led us to practice where we won't fall into the monotony of always eating the same. The last aspect that for me is one is not smaller, but it's one of the most important in moderation. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have a hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxieties to repeat the plate of purchasing with fruits. To think, right? So, what do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates? That hunger is not manipulable if food is restricted, if they get out of food, what is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion, to be the graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top. Every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength. So, if we don't stop each three, four hours to take a collection? That's it. That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat. And we're going to disappoint all the food around us. To go over. Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose, and no. The most expart body becomes to reserve, and when I mean to reserve, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body. The food only makes you fat, we go out of that ignorance, the food can hurt you or be cured, it depends on us, of taking awareness, with what we are feeding ourselves and in what quantity? Well, I return to moderation. That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation. That food stimulates overweight. To give you a closet, I propose you to eat everything you like, eat varied, but always take care of the portion. Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desaluna como Rei," "Hey, I can't," "I don't have," "Hey, I'm hungry" or "pior." Sometimes I died of soup. We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly, thank you very much. A while ago, I was obsessed by telling stories of research, but there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things, and they saved thousands of lives, I'm a scientist, and more or less since 2002 that I work in the University of Scientific, I love the first one that seemed obvious, Marie Curie, they didn't give me a Nobel Prize, so they deserve their pedestal. But I found her very little. How did I lose it, not give you an idea to the bronk that this gave me to have entered them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who were done, but, above all, to not lose salt? We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography, kids keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. Is there a new ortography missing? I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have. And the question and the answer are new in our language: Antonio de Nebrijas came to our ortography, a clear and simple principle, so we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says we have to write, according to how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that was written in its original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with waves and decades. Three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three. However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, we all went to school, they didn't come to tell you anything that you don't know for their own experience, we all invested large amounts of time of learning, large amounts of that time of plastic and child brain, indicated, in the memorization of ortographical rules, full, without a previous question, which was the function that fulfilled ortography. What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you do that question, the answer is quite simpler and less trascendent than what you want to believe, ortography is good or it's good, according to just or not to other aspects of language, like punctuation, we can't dedicate it to other issues of language that are complex, if you deserve time and effort. (Video) What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want. The language is an absolutely clear tool that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of conventions that we still use common criteria, but it also seems to me to write with a decoration, and it's absolutely clear that ortography doesn't mean anything about language quality. But let me return to the teachers, because they are key characters in this story, I mentioned the ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the educated of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what teachers are told to us all that time to ortography, but we shouldn't forget. Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers, or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters, who pushed the greatest ortographic reforms, sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, that was the one of Chile, mediated. In the 19th century. Because then, I'm going to take the position of those teachers and start moving forward in our ortography, I'm here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. We eliminate Hémuda, where we wrote an H, but we didn't pronounce anything, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attach can justify for someone. All the fats that cause HMUDA, Bélarga and B Corta said before: "Never distinguish themselves in the Spanish language, we choose one, it can be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument, we don't with one, we eliminate the other." Jalabe, giraffe, people, Argentine. And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended, now I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two and three letters, we go down to two. We are all better. Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not so much: the Spanish Academy is linked to the history of traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool for the use of today. And that explains that our language, much more than those we know, that we have geographically close, were modified some changes in the dictionary of the Real Academy, we went from theater to theater, we went from symbol to symbol, and, little by little, now, they start to remove themselves blindly, harmony, they can write with H or synacy. And we're all fine. It also seems to me that this is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion. It always tells us that language changes spontaneously from below to above, which are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications, and that authority, in some places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry. This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of success, for the level of words, it's less true, for a long time, institutions that fixed the norms and proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that it speaks? But at our time, the time of social networks is suffering a revolutionary change, it has never been written as much as now, never so many unbelievable ortography people, and in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing the great ortographic uses in the social networks. It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication for now. There are chaotic, individual uses, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that follows writing, a new place, is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do badly to reject them. To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinable norm with the needs of our times. I can anticipate some objections. There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we want to preserve etymological dictionary, a second operation of those who say if we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguising between these words that today differentiate in only one letter: that is true, but it's not a problem, our language has the bench where we sit in the bank where we deposit the money, the tragic, the tragicy, which we will not reach with ortography. And for me? The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, which is the one who say: "I don't want to change." I educate myself like this, I get used in this way when I read a written word in simplified ortography: "My eyes hurt." FD: That objection is inside each one of us. What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of us, so I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean in our ortography? All those habits we use because we receive them, even if they don't serve us, I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest environment, but important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future. Good afternoon, before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes, I had the eyes coffee with a sloppy around Liris, and saying to me, "My mom, don't blame her eyes." After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death. Well, maybe for my training as a photographer. Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope. To surprise all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images, the discovery that made my view of the world transformed. Well, the whole universe inside my mind. It was like being floating in the universe. It was like being that space, an exciting space, without body. It was absolute content, it became peace. This image. Let's see it. And that's the image of my microscope father's seeds. And this other one is the brother of someone else. All my fear and my sadness disappeared, I didn't feel disconnection from anything or anyone. His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project. For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence we are scared by the cosmos. And that when we look at the mirror, there are perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe. And that matter is not created nor destroyed. It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy. And space technology: their satellites travel around the planet. It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating. So we shouldn't create an IBAP of education. Imagine a public agency that designs content and strategies to transform learning, that develops the research of borders to use, for example, artificial intelligence in the education of large scale. (Laughter) A agency with pedagogists, designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you. For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logic of the short term, the maximum specialists should reach and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management: the first step. It's thinking about the state as a possibility, not as variable of all the adjusts, just like that, changes in education will not benefit the most advantages. (Applause) I'm not a scientist, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. And many times, in this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react to extraterrestrial situations, from great loves, to pandemic. And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves the most ridiculous and the most worldwide, for example, the world obsession would buy mountains of hygiene. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous, it's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball that doesn't know it won't happen. And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy. But it's also very unique to humans to try to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese Government, in only 10 days, didn't only have found the virus that produces the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public, called the optimist century, the same thing in a great opportunity of today. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or doctors, but that are more moral or social, and, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up in guilt or stigmas, for example, in the vast bubble, it accused to the judges in Europe and to the Chinese in San Francisco with the United States, but they are more moral or social ones, why are they really propagating the disease? In this pandemic, like many others, the most expensive ones, are useful, above all, to avoid people who are already inherent contagi to others, that abuse it all the world, it's a way to avoid the stigma, and with this, to take care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered in our traditions, in our habits, in our businesses, because it's impossible to change, but the truth is that education can't change and that it was extremely difficult to change, and, however, in three days, now all kids educate in their house, it's our extraordinary capacity for change. Also, of course, they change our values, our judges, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, only two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority. And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a small mental experiment: it's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future? Imagine the following situation: we are at the beginning of the pandemic, we are at the beginning of the pandemic, we also suppose a government and other public sectors that can use this information to restrict the movement of the people in a specific way, it can come out, we are supposed to save the economy and the world in the way we have done it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk that they make a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic, could you choose if it looks good or bad to do this? And what would you do? I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention that is there, between one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pillar in our culture. And on the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic. To take care of us, to have our data a little like vaccinating us, it's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties, as part of a social impact, maybe and everyone. A while ago, with the Chile, we also found a good solution of commitment: when all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free, active, sex and care? Are you going to fly less in a sky? Would we change the way to greet ourselves? Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want the preservative sex of the coronavir. My first encounter with a fossil was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina. I had been many times in museums, with salt full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field. It was a animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before. The animal I found was similar to this, as a moment we called it "Dolares de Mar," are relatives from the Mar's Ears, and they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for 15 million years, and immediately tried to take it. And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know. But I'm interested in fossil fuels, nor fascination by these past beings, to imagine how our planet had been in the past, and I saw that my paleontologist career had started in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago. Our planet was very different as the one today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated by dinosaurs and other raptile groups. And I told you 100 million years ago, which is a quantity that we, paleontologists, mentioned daily, but very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people. Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people: 10,000 by 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a number that doesn't enter the head. And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us in our heads. But well, the life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago. I've traveled for deserts and fossil studies of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it also led me to a very special place, which is Patagonia. Naturally, we think about 70 million years ago, but for us, we know many fossils of the Patagonia, and for example, we know that in the northern hemisphere, the dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called "Belissauries," where the Patagonia's newspaper belongs to us. But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before? At that time, all the continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea, and we know very little about what happened in this time, in the healing hemisphere. And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet, for the first time they reached giant size for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the carnivorous niches of omnivores in the whole planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic. And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found it four years ago, in Cerros like this, walking a lot of heat afternoon. And after walking all day, I mean returning to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks on the floor, and I approached the idea that I was approaching, it was becoming more clearly what it was. It was the trick of a dinosaur. I got closer, stood next to me, stood up, really. I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what was the track of a carnivor dinosaur. But I couldn't really believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life. Then, despite the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of... To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum. And we started to take it low. But the expedition was already over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a large escape, until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the excaution and see if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found, or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day of the expedition, clearly the animal was dead in the dinosaurs' shoes, a complete skeleton preserved in an intact way its exkeleton. And then the excavation really begins: reading, staying, cap, those sediments that were shaking where it would open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's for the first time, going back to the surface, an animal that lived in that same place for 60 million years. The Germal had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, that they kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediment caps, and in that same process, bones turned into fossil fuels for chemical reactions. Then all that package of hidden rocks had to climb the surface for some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some levanty of all this block, and there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these glasses, looking for those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting. And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun, the Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to take all these protected remains to the lab: in the museum, the museum begins with an infinite patience, they are removing grain to grain. All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs. And that's when we saw that this family had been originated 100 million years before what we thought, much before the South hemisphere and the North hemisphere separated in being lived by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent. Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we do in the lab, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks. The challenge was quite complete and told with a very well preserved and with some very strange teeth, in a way of hand, and that's why we call this "man and Dance." Now, this dinosaur is very particular, in addition, for something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replication of the channel of this dinosaur, it's a very small dinosaur, one of the small concepts of the head at the end of the tail. And this mini dinosaur was not so surprising because if you see in the South Africa map, in Atlantic Ocean, which separates these two continents, but again we had a case of restricted animals, only from the North hemisphere, and that they had nothing to do with the North hemisphere. We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern. And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that live in this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big black circle, it was a great desert what was isolated to this fauna making the evolution in an independent way and completely separated from the fauna's fauna's fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water. And when we think about dinosaurs? And we found fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really found fantastic, fascinating things: the limits of the body size in life's history have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing. It's that they take us to understand chapters like this, the history of the planet. And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives to learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. The Earth is a big book with a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years, and life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years. That in millions of pages yet by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today is fundamental to know their story. Because knowing the past is key to understand the present. It's also key to design a future. Like many of us, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers. Today, I want to share with you six ideas, anticipating what would later read so much books and live in so many movies, I dreamed of looking and trying to understand how these superpowers work, the most important thing in this situation that defends small villages, which is superpowers, but in the real world, and almost without realizing it. Obviously, there are many more superpowers and many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less known. Those I'm going to tell you are my ideas, I've learned from others, and this is, maybe, the main one of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you, that we are able to learn and practice. So let's go, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine that they enter a gym, look at those on the floor, parents, bicycles, daughters, they go to the bar, they have a coffee with milk, with three meters of Manteque, that they're supposed. It doesn't work like that, our body doesn't improve with this. Well, compensating happens the same, not being able to think, because it counts to think. We have to practice thinking, developing in us the habit of thinking, intelligence is not something we have or we have, it's something we use or we use. It's the second. It says the saying that in only a tournament we need a disturbing, and if we need to cut something, we need a resource, we will find ourselves in different disciplines, and if we have many mental models in Japan, in Tanzania, in engineering, in psychology, in psychology, with more tools, we allow ourselves to do more things, to solve more problems. To think better we have to expand the box of tools of our heads, but all the problems will seem to be linked. It's the third. Little by little, I was in the club and at the table of the side, a man told his friends about his son and his classmates that had told him about the teacher of his son for a mistake that the teacher had committed. Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher. But it didn't realize what. By saying this, he was generating a much greater evil in his child. I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends and I was underestimating the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn. Many times we don't realize that being focused on winning in a scale makes us have success in that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another most important scale. When we act, we think about what is the impact we are going to do, and what is the most important scale to have money and freedom, or to give freedom and lose love in which we have to think like acting. The fourth. And the principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. For example, now in the pandemic, many acts of the Chinese situation came, and the means of generating an emotion, fear, those impressions were generated, the country we feel more familiar and similar to China, and emotions make us act, we are all now preventing what is moving. This time we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone seemed to us before. But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel. And the practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. You have hunger, hunting is something, you have an immediate compassion, you eat what you get married, but cultivating is very different, you make the effort now for something you're going to be able to throw inside six months or a year. This is the pillar of almost everything we have, but to come to generate applause, because it's avoiding something nobody is well-being, but saves lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling, that is to develop our ability to anticipate, it's one of the main skills to think well. Let's think a minute, what do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we live? The fifth: we all evaluate things according to our expectations; if something bad lasts three months if we think it would last six months. And we are happy. If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different. If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example, at 19 we are exhausted, if we program to run 20 km9 we are unbearable. But the key to resilience is to handle expectations well, the sixth and last one. Have you ever happened that you met a well-known place, you're walking through a public in the middle of the Nadipoom, a high school classmate that wouldn't happen 15 years ago, you can't create the unlikely chance to find it in that place? It's true, finding that classmate in that place is something totally improbable, but, in fact, it's very likely to find someone in a very improbable place, but, as we know so many people, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of the same life, there are so many unlikely things that make us think that the unlikely is impossible and it's not. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis that little of the future, we don't know what will happen. Neither now my field with more normal times, we have to learn to live with the uncertainty. And the best intelligent way to coexist with uncertainty and if someone ever asks you, don't think only about the most likely and search for careful ways, when it's possible, of serious things, even if it's very likely. That because once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world, with a secondary classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years. That is to say, at first, that the idea of this talk has to do with being accepted and learning has to do with the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking, to be able more important people to enrich our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others, an interview for 40 years, the interview Domis is a question, and when Borges replied. He looked at him, asked for excuses, Borges stayed quiet, and told him, "This same question four years ago hasn't had much time to think about this subject during these four years." Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live to be accepted by new ideas that are emerging and be always open to change our way of thinking. Thank you. Women are irrational beings, always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives, they will be able to take care of it. This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for children and young people's education about marriage. Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930. But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915, no country in the world, women could vote, in 2015, that is, in 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women, in 1910. (Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize. (Laughter) But the French science Academy said that he didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of those who are here had already finished the primary. The University of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, left a woman to be a master's degree. The University of Yale admired women, the Prince University, in 1972 and we could continue. This was the idea that women only serve to create children and help their husband, which is a rational, aesthetic series. It was a truth made a century ago, they believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment, and almost all, taking 5,000, maybe, believed that this idea was a truth made. Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed? Because we are living the most assombrous, transformation, the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions that we've lived in, if the truth is true, there are no facts, there are only interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world, 2,500 years ago, Pindaro said this in a poem, now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the objective world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it. When you say that there are no facts, that only exist social interpretations, they are the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. What is an interpretative mark, what day is today 24th September? Does anyone doubt it? What day is it for you? (Laughter) Well, let's see that it's on September 24th, because everything we're here is part of a very arduous social construction, that we've automatized and naturalized, cats live without a calendar. If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, we would have a relationship with the world, my dog, Jap, Alcador, and who is very lonely at home, making some evil, don't look at the clock, that it would be perhaps, and little more stimulused, but surely the world in which we wouldn't have any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at an apple, it was written the law of gravity, which is genius, but that's how ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that was, the same thing that we see in scientific movements, the technological innovation, that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that the genius had never been able to develop in the 19th century, but the time was created in the house and created the children. And, however, in less than 100 years, the half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost for humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels. How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity? In other words, errones ideas are monsters, there's an idea we can do it. You will say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and all those things, and yes, the relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, there were always the creation of homosexuality, until 1860 there were no homosexuality at all times. They were even documented in many species outside the human being, but they had never thought that sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally created. It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A. Moreover Victorian, who was one of the great forms of social control during a centuries and peak, stronger than exists, because the same thing that turns into the section of catolic church when something we want to do doesn't have turbs. (Laughter) You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you guilt, it's a great social control, (Applause) (Applause) You don't wish the woman of your fellow man or the man of your fellow man. (Laughter) That it's going to give fault, it's going to give you guilt, and, on the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they promise us to eat, we can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censors, the same as women before, or that the Jews, or that the blacks who had left the sexual point of view, put it there, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as the women who were bad, the society of the sexual point of view, and when they were slaves. It also changed the social situation, but in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned to be frightened, but there's also a drama of the fight of gay, women, blacks, etc., all the depressed, take their identity for 20 years, and then make the homosexuals be respected, which are also human beings who have full of rights, and they don't have no longer have no longer had sex. And the gays, the Jews, the blacks, the white, we are all complete, complex people, contradictories, that maybe the most terrible thing is jail, the jail. 50 years ago. Look how old I was, I was a homosexual boy, I didn't know what a homosexual child was, and I didn't know the homosexual word either, and my colleagues told me, "Gordo, we're going to turn around." "Thank you, don't look at me." And I didn't know what it was, nor howdopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything, and at the same time I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that my father loved me, looked at me. And I started to feel what would I have done so that it come out like that, what was it like? I had to learn what to do like that, I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. And to assume the identity there was a positive side. I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't replace me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. And I stopped being a person. And I'm a person, like any other person in the world, I'm against victory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings, and it took me 50 years to learn that this idea I had to understand that there are no facts that exist. Audience: Yes. (Applause) (Applause) Interpretations. (Applause) There are the contradictions and it's going to say, because in fact, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend me, and now I want to leave my prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful. Do you think jail is? That's it, or they told me, "The constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, that there is a list of things we need to survive: Mexico, San Pedro, our community, full of confusion, where a storm is completely different, the constantly with this channel and everything that is disappeared." When everything you do is a combination of energy, each of these ideas looks like a bomb, you search for exterminating, but once you say it, every moment, it's a combination of energy, you've learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, movements that take moments, as a chain, but once you use the intensity of your ideas, and apart all those ghosts that you don't stop laughing. That voice, a microphone, a paraglid, a class of dance and a better friend, that voice that you all know, that voice that you probably don't be a work of art, that knows you probably are looking for something you lose, that person is a better friend, a paraguas, a library, a dance class, and a better friend, without that, and I can't survive. What we created in small cities, I'm sure that once we said, there's no opportunity to get rid of, there's nothing to do, I can't progress in the way I would like. (Laughter) Do you remember that heat and with a bread, reminds his experience, if he doesn't have the mind? There he always appears in a scene, a person goes in the year, and with all the time married was better? Is this really like that? To think about this, it's from 2009 when we should go to the secondary school, or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us in these photos that are seeing there, Ranco and Manuel. What I can tell you about my friends, that I really want, who are like my brothers, who go to the surprise, to the day of today, can't get a job that allows them to get their dreams closer. As for me, that I had studied what I liked, because I knew that if I stayed here in the city, I could study the other, but probably the future as a person, the lack of opportunities is also present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort on humans, and they are quite opportunities. (Laughter) Have you ever wondered why these things happen? We live in full 21st century, we are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization, in which successes and advances are with a speed that surprise us all and above the borders and barriers that insists among people. And in this context? And cities, to make more and more important cities, are our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. It is estimated that in 2058% of the world's population will live in a city. Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would have to be almost 10 people in the whole world. Seven decades. If there are more people, they choose to live in cities, they want to say "fuck" where we have greater possibilities to progress. What do they explain, then, that while the city stops falling in time, other progresses, vibrants, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them? I'm going to tell you a key word that you want you to go to the cow, when you get out of that door to return home, this is strategy. If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. It makes us feel our strength, our potentialities, part of my concern, as a professional future in the field of international relationships, and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. Now, come and see how all this is beautiful that I'm telling you about real life, and avoid migration to other places in search of a better future. In the second place, as I'm going to tell you that it's a kind of reaction of proportional relationships, of my friends, it's about which we add a fifth friend to the group: "The lack of the lack of opportunities, what we're going to improve." [A.DE.] Franco, for example, who is also right in this picture. It was the national champion of geography unit in 2002. But today, although it's left to dedicate you to a school teacher, it doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday working to be able to live. (Laughter) Then, after the fire I like to go to the subway, how much I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the strength of security in the infortaly, but, as I didn't count with that possibility here, then I started to find what is the economic remix. It's going to college to study programming, and you can't develop your potential and keep learning what you like, because you can't work in your local that built from nowhere, all the day working in your local location, which is a genius that illustrates, but doesn't know the genius, you see any things, but it depends on the lack of presupportion of biodiversity. Time studies programming, and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study it. The worst of all this I'm telling you is that we, as young people, have nothing to do less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing, do you know? (Laughter) Recently, I had the huge fortune of being the energy between a group of 8 young people at a World Cup to participate in a week in New Dele, the capital of India, and I left the representation of Argentina, I went to the only incredible experience, that is, I went back to my head. But if there are two things that I'd like to share with you are brilliant, in one or two, there are millions, but there are no less important ones, you know what differentiates them, that we don't have, but there are millions of opportunities out there, for all the tastes and for all the values. Another time we want better cities, we know strategically in the world. For the first time in Rosario that I could study, I remember, I was a bit scared to fulfill 18 years. (Laughter) This can never find this in public because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult to leave your city, to play, to the day of today I feel like that, six years went by, it's like leaving a piece of your heart. Because this doesn't happen to you, not to your friends, nor to anyone you know, it's necessary to give them tools to our young people, so they stay in their cities and grow from there. In the end, what's more beautiful than giving wings to the city you had to do. And with a strategy we can do it. Imagine the brilliant I would have been Franco if I could completely dedicate myself to geography. If I had the necessary security programs to continue what I like. Is it like that? (Laughter) That's how you see the ghost of opportunities. Yes, all this that I'm telling you doesn't seem enough argument and want a more example. "Look." (Audience) I'm sorry. This is the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I could overcome the profound decrease of mine in which I fell because I had to go to college. After two suicide methods. In numeral, psychological sequels that cost me a lot, a lot of surpasses. If we want these things to stop passing, we have to go out strategically. Please, let's not add a final point to our cities. Thank you very much. I'm a surgeon. Well, from always the surgeons. We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. Well, in my last 10 years. (Laughter) My research, in my case in the zoo, was based on looking for the reasons to operate less and more patients. That can be done in several ways, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair for themselves, using their own ability to regenerate, this is what we do with biological platforms that are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own ability to restore after a damage. And finally, with new technologies. We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before we had to operate and take them out. (Video) Robotics are giving us a lot of tools to facilitate these tasks. What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate. It gave me many satisfactions, me and a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized that developing goals, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work. I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. Thank you. I'm not a doctor of the Japanese society, and I think that certain behaviors and answers can help us when facing a crisis like this one. It's worth asking us a first question, being so close to China, having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space, why Japan? Being in the second country with more fumers for many inhabitants. Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth? And theified, but a linear progress until now. Many people, in a little place, and a fourth of those people, basically, Japan showed us a cocktail that would allow a very contagious virus in this propagation of the disease, with more than 65. So, what happens? Japanese is a society that went through wars, typhones, educated in such a way, that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it: Japan, they are friends. Thank you very much. Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 temblors per day. Generation between generation has had to overcome natural disasters caused by men. This is what we can think with something that really likes Argentines, soccer teams, like example. What football team will make better performance before a critical moment? The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do. Or the team that has never trained, that has no infrastructure, and that has to go out to improvise. The directives of social distancing, hygiene and individual behavior are associated with their own house. The Japanese population hasn't established it for hundreds of years, it doesn't make it, it doesn't make it, it's greeting with a reverence. Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most workers in public places use a lot. It's not necessary to recommend to take the shoes out of the house, because this is a usual protocol to feel cold, but to protect themselves, we don't have to indicate, we don't sleep or to be on another person, that more than 50% of Japanese will be protected between Japanese. Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture, the good of everything is more important than the good of one part. (Laughter) To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers did in Japan, in a school, in Japan. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, put themselves music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, stayed all following the place to a classmate. Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers. The word "how" expresses this way of being, it's about having the trust that the other will take care of me, in resonance with feeling that we realize when we take care of others. Thank you very much. In the example of children, we can see how a collective society works, it helps itself, because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
