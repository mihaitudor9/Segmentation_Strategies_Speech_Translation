(Laughter) I have a message for your children and grandchildren and I need you to help me swimming.
It's very simple.
We need to learn to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lomboca's star, in Indonesia.
At 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity, recipes, corals, tortures, mold fish.
In the fish of all colors, I had a intense feeling of being connected with nature, it was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish, from foreigns.
Negers and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself.
It was a very spiritual feeling, and that's what you're thinking: this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, it's the same thing my students think at the university, every time I tell him, look at each other.
And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy.
(Laughter)
And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist.
B.G: The 24-hour work, during a week, to draw that artwork we're going to see, and that I'm not crazy, and if I'm able to talk to fish.
Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, with rocks, with mountains and with other natural phenomena?
I think so.
Last year, the Scientific magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between inmates and predators, that is, for every four bottles there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
In other words, paradoxically, according to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced.
(End of video) I agree with the law of Cleber.
A elephant that has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse.
But three rooms.
And if they stop thinking about it?
But the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I ask myself: Is it a meracuincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
Well, after thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research.
That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the human being, then I realized that nature has the principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development.
And I remember, with the scientific consensus, the explosion of life was originated with the first complex cells that have been increased to a large speed, for example, a wide range of organisms that were maintained in 1800 million years, with the extinction of oxygen in the atmosphere and the miracle of life, between 3500 million years.
The Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that Coa-Apiz, 200,000 years ago, the human being has been adapting the environment in a transcendental way, with the disappearance of the agricultural dinosaurs, which domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years, has reached around 250 million years.
In a 30-year-old Parliament, or maybe 100 million species, a single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of the species, and that's if it's crazy, and we are all responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs, but the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him.
In this half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
Well, if it seems we've forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees.
And if that was little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth.
So, from half of the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth.
Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Forum of nature?
If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours, but we don't have four planets, right?
So that's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming, and what does this mean?
Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater, and we take fire to the bottles in which you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
A chronic scenario of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignified way, that's why people learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that only survives the strongest, those who adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
(Laughter) If it's true that there is violence and predation and excess, in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it.
It's not competence, but cooperation.
I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach a novel, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation.
The football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with all the technical body behind it.
Our body is a plural cell phone organism where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are.
Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to achieve sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time.
Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed the communism that also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has also failed, has more money than the rest of 99.
That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
In other words, that we don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because nature is signed to obtain economic benefits, we've sent to the outside space and recycled at the bottom of the sea.
The money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
And it's something that's inside all of us, we all have this faculty, and I invite you to make a game.
Imagine what happens to them with this veruga: How could the engineers, architects, economists, inspire us?
Well, for them a plane came up.
What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"?
But the Japanese did the train Bala.
And with this "Murcié Lago."
We could make a trunk, right?
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could make bioclimatic buildings.
With this Girasol.
A plant of solar boards.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Pio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But do we keep thinking that nature?
It will be there forever.
Many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build.
To climb so much percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material.
For the industry.
We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Can you imagine?
I have a dialogue future with their children and grandchildren.
I would like you to tell me, "Daddy."
At least you try it, fight.
And you.
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What I have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity, and the pandemic is not an opportunity, it's terrible things, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically.
We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our friends.
This doesn't happen at all, it's a horrible moment, and I learn from them: we learn the pain of the disease, I say that life doesn't treat us anything else, that we spend horrible times and we learn from them, and that it's a great moment to learn, it's a moment for nothing.
We learn from war, from death, we always fight and we're going to keep doing it.
So that's it.
That's what we're going to do now.
And what I've never thought about entering?
It's an idea in which I'm meditating, from a book, when I diagnosed with HDV, and then he decides when he calls his childhood to the gardenery, "Take exams a sign, which, in fact, can be a lot of diagnosis that is called the modern nature of his career."
But what he decides is that he will buy a landing in a horrible place and he will take care of a garden.
And it was impressive.
Like a person writes you.
And for him, taking care of a garden wasn't doing time.
It wasn't, well, passing the route.
It's not like now that we spend the time cooking, cooking, or cleaning, and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see plates, not the only tasks that are promised in those."
And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism.
From Fredygenger, it's almost mental, and it's more specially the feminist weapon.
To talk about reproductive work, not even the productive work, which is the one that puts new things in the world, we can say, that is, there's always a key problem, it doesn't matter, and this productive work is the one that reproduces the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook the work for the next day to put the factories.
That reproductive work is also working, increasing correctly.
But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value, why the fat of thinking in that relative value first we don't think of an absolute value?
It's even more, why don't we do it as an excrement and think that this difference is contrast between productive and reproductive work is a more infective difference given by one side?
Of course, gender, for the idea that there are tasks that are important, these are the productive, and reproductive, through the minds, for the important women, and also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is valid is the subject that makes the origin, it produces the world where the subject takes care of taking care of taking care.
It's something that doesn't make you special, you're not originating, you're an artist, you don't make you think, you're an important person, right?
These are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days?
We are living without advertising, without writer, without a lot of things, even drinking without powerpoints and the world keeps spinning, but the world doesn't travel without food and without care.
Without nurses and no health.
The only thing that allows us today?
Is it comar?
And they cure and clean.
And without that, the world magic.
Understanding.
Those tasks have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value.
And not only that, but not only something mechanical that we would necessarily have to go through the river, that hope it wouldn't exist, that each other could do that, clean it almost, cook, nor solve food.
We can think about it like this, we have thought it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read to Germans is that...
We can also live them in a different way, as tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which we are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with compensation with nature.
It's also interesting.
The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that we have to take care of the body, the genius, we have to cook, only to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
He looked at me.
This is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are and that our body will be able to survive.
Does it look like me?
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, I want to return to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is.
No, we all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity.
"Dad, the world needs more novels."
I thought, "Well.
Why not?
And to know all the colds, and with all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the body, with the careers, with the others and with all that?
That's why, in fact, when they invited me to do this case that I don't know, because it seemed to me, I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world hasn't been that novel and the world doesn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought, in fact, we were going to write, bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already taking care of with my books, and that maybe I tell other people, right?
More than writing, reading, and more than doing.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So, because I want to say with this, that the man accumulates, because when we have a man, we're going to disappoint all the food we're consuming at the same time, and in this case, when he doesn't eat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, he't have a lot of sweat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, heat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, heat, heat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, he doesn't eat, he doesn't have a lot of sweat, heat, heat, heat, and heat, heat, heat,
Now, for a while, I'm obsessed by telling stories of amazing women, but there are many others who didn't get into a Nobel Prize, but they gave me the most important things: I entered the story of Ugeneas Ardote, Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war, so it seemed obvious, Marie Curie, they didn't give me a Nobel Prize, so it was deserved in two.
Eugenia works actively until 2004, and they say it was very copied that you could go to talk to her, and you know that 2011 was 111 years old.
I found her very little.
And how did I lose it, they didn't give us an idea to the bronk that this gave me to have entered them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who were, but above all, to not lose those who are, thank you.
We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography.
Kids keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They come bouncing from the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Spanish language.
Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to write how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today.
It's because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another etymological criteria that says that we have to write, according to how words were written in its original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with HS, which sometimes are as in people.
And sometimes they sound soft, like fool, so we stay with six, six, and seats.
There are three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school, we all invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and infant brain, indicated.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions.
They brought us in many simplic and explicit ways, the idea that in ortography something was fundamental in our training.
However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask the answer, it's much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes.
Ortography is used to uniform writing.
For everyone to write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it, but in contraposition with other aspects of language, like puntuation, for example, in ortography, there is no individual ability involved in punctuation itself.
With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, or it's OK, or it's bad, according to just or not to the old norms.
But then it wouldn't be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly.
Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms so that all that time we dedicate them to the teaching of ortography we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, deserve time and effort?
What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not a tool of common use, and therefore it seems fundamental to me that we use common criteria, but it also seems fundamental to me that these criteria are the simplest it can be, above all, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not in anything the quality of language.
I work every day with the literature of the Ololego's century, Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo, that sometimes they write: "Men, sign, sometimes they write with Becorta."
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality.
But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story, I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive with which teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography, but it's true that being the things like they are, that makes us all the sense.
In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is written: you can become a public bubble, a bad bird.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography, but we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, there were always teachers, or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters, who pushed the greatest ortographic reforms, sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, the greatest spanious language, which was the Chile of media.
In the 19th century.
Because then, not taking the position of those teachers and start moving forward in our ortography, I here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I wanted to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing.
Audience: Yes.
Let's eliminate HMUDA, where we wrote an H, but we didn't pronounce anything, we chose to be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each of us will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument, that we don't eliminate the other: "Ge, jump," "Ge," "Gee," "Geeeee," "Geeeeeeeeeeeee," "I'll divide the sound," "Sh."
Jalabe, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended, now I said before, it's that it's in some places that correspond to a sound in other two and three letters, we go down to two.
We are all better.
(Laughter) Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not so much.
The real Academy Spanish Academy is linked to the history of traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that attachment to history, traditions and customs are transformed into a obstacle.
For today's use, that explains that our language, much more than those we know, that we have geographically close, were modified some changes in the dictionary of the Real Academy, ARPA, harmony, they can write with H or Cinaje.
And we're all fine.
Does it look like me as well?
That this is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion.
It always tells us that language changes spontaneously, below, up.
They are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications.
And that authority, in some places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a lot of time later, accepts them and incorporates this, just for some levels of language, is true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above, they were always the institutions that fixed the norms and proposed modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use that speaks, but at our time, the time of social networks is suffering a revolutionary change?
It has never been described as much as now, never as many ortographical users, where even people of impecable ortography and predicted ortography are watching the majority of the users of social networks, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and the speed in communication, for now.
There are chaotic, individual uses, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that signs writing to a new place is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do badly to reject them.
To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinable norm with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, we wouldn't reach ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with a simplified ortography, we will go to recover etymology at the same place we go now, to etymological dictionary.
A second operation of those who say, "If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguising between these words that are different in only one lyrics, that's true, but it's not a problem, our language has the bench where we deposit the money, the suit that we put ourselves in the context, any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
What about me?
The most comprehensible, even the most conmoved one, which is the one they say, "I don't want to change," "I educate myself like this, I get used in this way when I read a word written in ortography, it hurts me in the eyes." That objection is part of each one of us.
What do I think we have to do to do as it's always done in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, they let us write as we are used to, and they wait for time to feel the new norms?
The success of all ortographic renovation that touches so arraigated habits is in the prudence, consensus, gradualism and tolerance.
But we can't let the rule, the old customs, prevent us from going forward.
The best tribute we can take to the past is to improve what we receive, so I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography all those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us.
I'm convinced that if we do that, in the modest environment, but very important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future.
It was like being floating in the universe, for me, this image, just like when we look at the mirror, we felt disappointed my vision of the world, it was like being that space, and when we look at the mirror, that's the image of my father's signs from the microscope, and this other, and tell me: "My mom, don't forget your eyes, maybe for my training as a photographer, thank you." (Applause)
In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
His satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating.
Shouldn't we create an invasion?
Imagine a public agency.
That designs content and strategies to transform learning.
I work with schools to rewrite what happens in classrooms.
That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
A agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mix of innovation in public management.
Well, the first step.
It's thinking about the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all the adjusts.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advantages.
(Applause) I'm not a scientist, and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations.
From big loves, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemic.
Until the fiction made reality.
And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of human condition.
Until the most ridiculous and the most worldwide.
For example, the world's obsession could buy mountains of paper and genius.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
PK: It has an unconscious logic.
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer.
It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology, called optimistic blind.
The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we talk about phone or worse, while we send messages, thinking that, in fact, we won't happen to us.
It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals.
Why does this happen to us now?
And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas.
For example, in the Bubonic Square, the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States, when, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones who were really preparing the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to avoid people who are already sick with other people.
However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs.
This first makes people who are healthy or contagi, and this is very important, but there's another most important reason, which is that if they only use more sheets we get sick, knowing who is sick and who doesn't use or not more shells.
That they use it all over the world is a way of avoiding self-esteem.
To take care of everyone.
Maybe what we've discovered the most in these days is our extraordinary capacity for change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do it.
This is the case of the discovery now, where we thought that education couldn't change and that they were those things that were extremely difficult to change it.
And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home.
We don't know some consequences of this.
We learned that we are willing to do it in the early need, and the world keeps moving.
Also, of course, our values, our judgment.
It was just two or three months ago when the pandemic started.
The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, by their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible then.
That everyone has to stay at home seems completely prioritarian.
And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We are at the beginning of the pandemic.
A public consorcio that includes the Organization of Salud.
But also Government and other public sector has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we are, who we find, and also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our viral load.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who.
Let's suppose that this consption can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way, so that they are rich and stay home, so it can come out.
Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of the epidemic.
It doesn't disappear completely, but it dies a lot less people and we can do it in a way that we stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk that they were a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free.
The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic?
And I could choose if it looks good or bad to do this.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is.
Among the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pillar in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics.
Maybe we have our data a little like vaccinating us.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom.
We found a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
Compreservative.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to get to feel free and care?
Are you going to fly less airplanes in the sky?
Will we change the way we greet?
Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever.
What do we want it to be the conservative sex of the coronavirus?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in museums, with full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nowhere.
A animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind, we call it "dolars of sea," they are relatives from sea services.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years.
I didn't know all this, I knew what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile: the sea dollar broke down, the sand crossed.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way.
I'm interested in fossil fuels, nor fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They followed me captivating and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one today: it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
And I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a quantity that we, paleontologists, mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stadium, which is many people.
Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, those are 100 million, that's a quantity.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us.
In my head.
But well, life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago, I've traveled deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it has also led me.
A very special place.
What is Patagone?
And when we say "patagonia."
(End of video) We naturally think of a bunch of forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes.
But for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered.
We fortunately know many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and the great majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia is the last period in which dinosaurs live in Earth.
What we call critical period, this is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while, at that time, in the northern hemisphere, other kinds of carnivores, like, for example, the dinosaurs.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the North of the South was not surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated isolated the continents of the North hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call "jurassic period," 100 million years earlier?
At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the Kurassic, in the south hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet.
His key hand, especially 60 million years ago, when dinosaurs, for the first time, reached giant size for the first time, were differentiated and conquered the living niches of carnivores of omnivores in the whole planet.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagon's curasic.
And that leads me to one of the stories of the discoveries we were able to do in the last years.
We found it four years ago, in hills like this, walking.
A lot of heat afternoon.
After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks, on the floor.
And I approached the idea that I was approaching.
It was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the traffic of a dinosaur, I got closer, I stopped next to me, I stood up.
I really stayed aside.
I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the track was of a carnivor dinosaur.
But really?
I couldn't believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life.
Then, warning the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was already over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
Until the next time given that the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the channel we had found, or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day of the stadium.
We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rarely.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life position.
Clearly, the animal was dead.
A layer of a lake and she has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way her sketch.
And then the scalp really begins: reading, staying, cap, those sediments that were shaking.
Where you open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time you're going back to the surface.
An animal?
That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Generally, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediment layers, and in that same process, bones turned into sedimental rocks, and in that same process, bones were transforming themselves into fossil fuels for chemical reactions.
And then, all that package of dry rocks, had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming.
From all this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover.
The layer I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills, looking for.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting.
Going discovering juices is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun.
The Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry.
All this rest is protected by layers to the lab.
In the lab, the museum begins another extremely long stage, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big.
All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs.
And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relievable parent of the South hemisphere.
And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before what we thought, much before the South hemisphere and the North hemisphere separated themselves being debated by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries we do in the lab, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
Dents in a very well preserved way, and with some very strange teeth, that's why this one opened it and called it "manidance."
Now, this dinosaur is very particular.
For something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replication of the channel of this dinosaur, it's a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, is that the complete milk wouldn't take more than 50 feelings from the end of the school.
And this mini dinosaur was not so surprising, because if you see in the South Africa map, in rocks of the same North hemisphere, studying its rest, we could see that its closest relatives had been found in the forms we found or that we knew from the North hemisphere, and this era of Pangea.
It's still not formed of the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents, but we had a case again.
Animals restricted, unique from the northern hemisphere, and they had nothing to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern.
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived at this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time.
Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century.
It was a great desert what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we found fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really found fantastic organisms, fascinating.
They have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life, have diversified and achieved all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing is.
It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming.
KA: The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years.
And life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years.
That millions of pages are still talking about this book, and if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today, is fundamental to know their story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
"Yes."
It's also key.
To project a future, thanks.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies.
I dreamed of competing.
To contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small lands of terrible invasors.
Well, time is.
It's not a quality bathroom.
It's through subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter.
You see empire without invading small villages and you don't have the position of panoramics to defend them.
But something about that child's vocation.
He stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated all my life to looking.
And to try to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
but in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation is to live.
What is the superpower of thinking better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
I'm going to tell you about my ideas, I learned from others.
And this is, maybe, the main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed.
But it can be developed.
Speaking of our mind with it.
Ideas powerful and practicing.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine they enter a gym.
Look.
That's on the floor.
These passengers will be measured around, bikes, daughters.
They go to the bar, ask for a box with milk, with three months of advanced students to be comfortable.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't improve with this.
Well, compensating happens the same.
It doesn't count being able to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice thinking.
They develop us the habit.
We need to think and give time to think.
Intelligence is not something that has one.
It's something we use or we don't use.
The second one.
Do you see the saying?
Those who only see a mattress see all the problems as a keyboard.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
Not to realize their keyboard.
If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing.
And if we need to cut something, we need a bear.
To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems.
And tools are usually called mental models.
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if we were trying to get a 2,000 with a noise.
If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models find?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times.
For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
Isn't it?
All problems will seem a keyboard.
The third.
Little by little I was in the club and on the side table.
A man decides his friends.
He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or a mistake that the teacher had committed.
Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher.
But he didn't realize it.
What about it?
In other words, this.
I was creating a much greater evil.
In Switzerland.
I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends.
And I was unpleasant to the teacher.
In front of all the children who had to learn from it.
Many times we don't realize it.
To be focused on earning a scale.
You don't know how to have success in that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another most important scale.
To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example.
No money, freedom, no freedom and losing love.
When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do.
And what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act?
The fourth.
The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impression is to have emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
We arrived a lot of Chinese situations.
But those acts didn't have impressions.
They generated emotions.
And they did not act.
When they started to get there.
Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These impressions generate emotion, fear.
And the fear of generating action.
We are all now watched, preventively, what is dying.
We were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because someone has come to us before.
But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric.
"Casar is a thing."
Do you have hunger?
Did you get married?
You have an immediate reward, you eat what you get married.
But cultivating is very different.
Do you make the effort now?
For something that will take place for six months or a half.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But we're going to generate applause.
Because you're avoiding something.
That nobody is a benicient.
But I save lives.
To develop our ability to act before feeling.
That is to say, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main abilities to think well.
Let's think about a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now.
That we still feel, we live.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think we would last six months?
We are happy.
If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last one month, we're sad.
It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
In kilometers, we are exhausted.
If we program to run 20.
Nine kilometers are unbearable.
We make a culte of resilience.
But the key of resilience is to handle expectations well.
The sixth and last.
Have you ever met a well-known place?
You're walking through a village in the middle of the swimming pool.
A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago.
You can't create an unlikely chance to find it in that place.
What truth is, finding that classmate, in that place, is something totally unlikely.
But how do we know so many people?
It's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of the same life, are there so many unlikely things?
It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the improbable is impossible, and it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little about the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Neither now, my field with more formal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
To always leave many open doors.
Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible for serious things, even if they are very likely.
And if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have cars with the tank of "hash full"?
Specifically.
Because once you find yourself in a village in the other side of the world.
With a secondary classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years.
I told you at the beginning that I guided Zeros of this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being accepted.
To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking.
And people with whom to cultivate these ideas.
We can give people to enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
A 40-year-old interview.
Entrevistator is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewed told me, "This same thing happened to me."
That same question four years ago.
"Moro did, I don't know what I thought."
He looked at him.
And he said.
I ask for excuses.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live.
To be accepted by new ideas.
Of the new cities are emerging.
And being open to change our way of thinking.
Thank you.
KA: Women are irrational beings, always given to emotional disorder.
That's why they need the custodian of a men, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father, and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of it.
(Laughter) This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for the education of girls and young girls about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times.
In 1915, no country in the world could vote.
In 2015, that is, there are hundreds of years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
But the science academic of France said that he didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of those who are here had already finished the primary.
The university of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, it's celebrating that, left a woman to be the master's degree.
Hale University admired women in 1972.
The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow.
This was the idea that women only serve to create children and help their husband.
It's a rational series, which is hystéric.
It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment.
And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they believed this idea, it was a truth made.
Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we're living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we're changing a conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions that we've experienced, if it's true, there are no facts, there are only interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem.
Now, neurobiologists, cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it.
When you say that there are no facts, that the interpretation is a sort of personal delirium, that interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong arguments, many people believe that interpretation is an interpretation is something subjective.
What is an interpretative mark, what day is today 24th September?
Does anyone doubt it?
What day is it for you?
(Laughter) Well, let's see that it's on September 24th, because everything we're here is part of a very arduous social construction that we've automatized and naturalized: cats live without a calendar.
My dog, Chiap, Alkeador, and who is very lonely at home.
No, making some misfortune.
I didn't know the time, I knew what I was going back.
It doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world?
That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked at a blanket, wrote the law of gravity: "What a genius!"
But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the travels he did, to know the animals he saw, all that had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc.
To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print.
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea.
The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it.
The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born, but it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same thing happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts only exist in interpretations, when we go to the economic and social field, the revolutionary change.
As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and raised the children.
And yet.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost in humanity to think more than to clean panels.
How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity ...
In other words, errones ideas are monsters, there's an idea we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half ago, and that example, to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality.
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, they always exist in every culture, at all times."
They are even documented in many animal species outside of humans.
But I had never thought that sexual identity, not bad, as it was called at that moment, determined how a person was.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A.
Victorian moral, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak.
The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex, when it proves us something we want to do, there are no turbies.
(Laughter) You're going to do it, but it's a great social control, (Applause) you don't stop the woman of your fellow man, or the man of your fellow man, you know we can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat.
(Laughter) Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, a waste bathroom where everything that was wrong is the society of the sexual point of view and put it there.
The homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks that were born out of slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, none of the situations today is ideal.
But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century.
Because 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals have full right, but there's a paradigm drama, and because this paradigm change allowed the fight of gay, women, blacks, etc., all the depressed, take their identity back, and then make the others understand that they are also human beings who have full right, but they don't only have the right to the marriage.
To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish.
However, I have to assume that, so that they respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, a chamber, so that they respect me as a black, only black, and the same only gay, and the identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible one in jail.
Of the jails.
50 years ago, as a old man, I was a homosexual child.
(Laughter) I didn't look at myself, and I didn't know what it was, I caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that my father, who loved me, looked at me, didn't know what a homosexual child was, but I didn't know the homosexual word.
And I started to feel what I would have done so that it would come out like that, what was it like?
I had to learn what to be like that, I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there is.
I had a positive side.
I learned to be respected, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not to rejected me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person, like any other person in the world, I'm with the dictatorship, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince the others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person, I say I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close the 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity for 20 or 30 years.
It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist.
(Laughter) (Applause) There are the contradictions and it's going to say, because really that, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are the interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that it's there to defend me, and now I want to leave my prison, it was so wonderful.
Do you think jail is?
Hi, or they told me, full of confusion, where there is a list of things we need to survive: Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to explore, but to explore is something different, the constantly with this channel and everything we know disappears.
(Applause)
When everything you do has paid for the voices of someone else, and you have to choose, you have to turn off your own movement, a class isn't bad, but once you say it, once you take a balance and ideas that come towards you all speed, and that you take a moment, as a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing.
Moments that keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be a work of art, but will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
That voice, your best friend, will always be the first to defend you, the first to give you a little look to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla, that person is your best friend.
A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without that a mechanism, I can't survive.
Through this context, some of you have wondered that what we really want, if each time you could study today, and probably in the future as a professional future, in the field of international relationships, and in this context, if you want to study what I liked, if every time you can go to the city, or if the city is more important, in the middle of the world is not in the world, if it's not in order to be able to be able to stay in the world, if it's not in order to be able to be able to go back to go back to reach your home.
It's inevitably remind of them of my friends, you know that when we share the mark of the lack of sports profounds, we have the urge for us, some of them have a couple of threads, but, in the second place, we also have to say that it's a species of proportional relationships, but what we're going to improve.
For example, I like to go to SUTE, but today, as I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to bring in one of the security for the country, but, as I didn't count with that possibility here, I don't have time because it has to be from some students who have a genius that was left below.
(Laughter) Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs.
It's that I learned a lot, but if there are two things that I'd like to share with you, there are absolutely nothing, it's enough, and I've already told you that with an incredible experience to participate in a week that the only Argentinian in that event will take part in the world, there are millions of opportunities there are strength.
We have to be willing to find them, because it's very difficult to find in public, it's very difficult to find cities, and in your friends, it doesn't happen to you, again, it's very difficult to stay in the city, but not less important, to give up the tools to our youths, because it's very difficult, and at the end, it's more beautiful, it's very difficult, and with a state, it's necessary, but everything that surrounds happening to me.
Imagine how brilliant I would have been, or how much, if I could have dedicated myself completely to geography.
Now, we don't go so far, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to be able to go.
That's how it's seen as an opportunity.
Yes, all this doesn't look like enough arguments that I'm telling you and want an exhibition.
This is the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I could overcome the profound decrease of mine in which I fell because I had to go to college.
After many, two suicide interpreters that told me, in numeral, psychological sequels, many of them have overcome.
If we want these things to stop passing, we don't add a final point to our cities, we have to go out strategically, thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm a surgeon, from always the surgeons.
We think that to have more work.
We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years?
My research.
In my case, in the zoo, the reasons were based on looking for.
To operate less and less to patients.
This can be done in several ways, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair themselves by themselves.
using their own ability to regenerate.
This is what we do with biological and maps that we read to the tissue so that it uses its own capacity.
Stop restaurating after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope.
To make procedures.
And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating.
To challenge.
My own paradigms of...
To have more patients to operate gave me many satisfactions.
Am I?
And there are a lot of patients who avoided.
We have to make a surgery.
With all this I told you, I realized.
That developing methods, increasingly invasive.
What do I have?
More and more work.
I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Thank you.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese, with sociological issues of Japanese culture, and I think that certain behaviors and answers can also help us when facing a crisis like this one.
It's worth making us a first question.
Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage?
If in January the first case was being so close to the neighbour.
Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space.
In other words, having the populations of the third age, older people in the world.
(End of video) Being a second country with more smoke per number of inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear and identified advance.
Until now.
We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious, in these demographic status, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease, basically.
Many people, in little place.
And a room of that people with more than 65.
What happens then?
The Japanese is a society.
Educed in such a way that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it.
Japan went through wars, Tifones, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
Thousands per day.
Generation between generation, catastrophes, natural has had to overcome co-generated by man.
This is what we can think with something that likes the Argentines a lot: soccer teams like an example.
What kind of soccer team will make better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do.
Or the team that never trained.
It doesn't have infrastructure.
And it has to come out to improvise.
The directives of social distancing.
And that's it, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or at home.
The Japanese population hasn't established, doesn't embrace hundreds of years ago, it doesn't need to say "have yourself."
Don't give kiss, because they don't do it.
It greets with a reverence.
Because giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public places use a lot.
It's not necessary to recommend to get out of shoes, to get home, because it's already customary.
In fact, Asian studies show that more than 50% of Japanese don't have to indicate, it's not to turn or root on another person, because this is a usual protocol between Japanese, they will use board to feel reflected.
Not to protect yourself, but to protect others.
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of everything.
It's more important to sell a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
You will surely know the game of the chairs, that the number of participants, and you'll get rid of, music, chairs in a circle, or less, of one.
In each round.
And he did this experience in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all following the place to a classmate.
Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers.
The word " japonesa" loves "expresses this way of being."
It's about having the trust that the other will take care of me, in resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works, it helps itself.
Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
