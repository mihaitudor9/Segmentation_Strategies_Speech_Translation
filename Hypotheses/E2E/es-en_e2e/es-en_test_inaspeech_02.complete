(Laughter) I have a message for their children and grandchildren. And I need you to help me swimming. It's very simple. We need to learn to feel. Think and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the minds of Lomboc, in Indonesia. At 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity of recipes, corals, tortures, mold fish. And from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature. It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience. So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish, from foreigns. Negers and yellow came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me. We were looking at each other. And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking. It was a very spiritual feeling, and that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right? It's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell it, look at each other. And they say, "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy. (Laughter) And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. KA: The work 24 hours during a week. To draw that artwork we're going to see, and that I'm not crazy, and if I'm able to talk to fish. Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants? With rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena. I think so. In fact, I bring you more scientific tests. Last year, the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse symbols were analyzed. In other words, scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between inmates and predators. In other words, for every four bottles, there were three lions. Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? Paradoxically, in amazing forms, this same mathematical pattern is reproduced in our inner, in our organic physiology. I agree with the law of Cleber. A elephant that has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse. But three rooms. And if they stop thinking about it? The planet we live in. It's made of three quarters of water. Right? So I ask myself. Is it a mere coincidence? Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness? After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution. That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research. That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify. The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being. That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here I bring you a summary. And I remember, with the scientific consensus, covers the explosion of the dictatorship, the Earth's first half was formed between 4,000 million years, during the first half of this period, by sending a amplitude, making strategies of survival, with very simple groups of oxygen. The Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species, that co-evolution in the planet Earth, since the Revolution of the Greek Greek dinosaurs, that domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years, the human being has been adapted to the middle of the environment in a transcendental way, as something unbearable. It's a species between species. In a 30-year-old Parliament or maybe 100 million species? A single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species, and that's if it's crazy. And we are all responsible. (Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs. But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him. This half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them. If it seems we've forgotten from Hirosim and Nagasaki, we've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, it's equivalent to the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach 65 million degrees. And that's why it was little. Generations future. Are you well threatened? Or the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breast, our mother Earth. Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth. Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity. According to the World Forum of nature? If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are given in the United States, we would need four planets like ours. But we don't have four planets, right? That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think. And act in harmony with nature. Besides, the use of... fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have created a big global warming, and what does this mean? Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater. And we take fire to the bottles where you are sitting. Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbari, right? Well, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. A chronic scenario of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignified way. That's why people learn to cooperate. Darwin told us that he only survived the strongest, the ones who best adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation. So, if it's true that there is violence and predation and excess, in any way. In life, in nature, what defines it, what defines it. It's not competence, but cooperation. I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids? Crossing, fighting, competing, to reach a novel, to fertilize it. What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a ovule between two different entities that create a new one. That defines life, cooperation. The football, for example. We all know that a team competes against another. But what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind. Our body? It's a pluricerular organism where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are. Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered catástrofes of meteorites and constant processes of trial and error. In other words, human beings do create ideologies of linear thinking. Doctrine is politics, like anarchism that failed, the communism, which also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has also failed. A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest of 99. That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren. In other words, that we don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that is psychopathic, because nature is signed to obtain economic benefits, we've sent garbage to the outside of the sea. The money has colonized life. And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. Because biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. I see life, my goal, imitation, imitation of life. But this is not new, the originary villages are already born, the indigenous people, for thousands of years. It's something inside us, we all have that faculty, and I invite you. To make a game. What an imaginary! What happens to this veruga? How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us? Well, it occurred to them to make a plane. What would happen to them with the peak of the marti-bolated bird? The Japanese did the train Bala. And with this "Murcié Lago." We could make a trunk, right? And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites. We could make bioclimatic buildings. With this Girasol. A plant of solar boards. As we know, there are millions of species in nature. Pio-inspiration is practically infinite. But do we keep thinking that nature? It will be there forever. And we have to overcome the cognitive face of the GDP. What does the GDP mean? Many economists tell us that we have to make, build. To climb so much percent of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material. For the industry. We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren. And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started? Can you imagine? Let's take a future to dialogue. With their children and grandchildren. I would like you to tell me. At least you try it, fight. And you. What would you like to hear? Thank you very much. (Applause) What we have to say is that the quarantena is not an opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, they are horrible things, we're going to do everything missing. But it has many complicated consequences, politically. A friend, Mentor. We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our friends. This doesn't happen at all, it's the respect, and it's not because thinking it's an opportunity to take advantage of and that we're not part of it, and it's a great moment to learn, it's a great moment for anything, it's a horrible moment. Do you say that? Life deals us to something else, that happens horrible moments and learn from them: we learn pain, diseases. We're going to move the war, the death, we're always achieved if we're going to keep doing it. So what? That's going to be now. And what I didn't have to enter? It's an idea in which I was meditating from a book. It's called modern nature, but it's the right to the world. These are the newspapers that took me to the 80s, when they diagnosed with HIV. So he decides to go back to his childhood to the gardenery, but that's not a kid who, in fact, later, diagnosed. They are a lot of very important movies, some of the most important ones in their career. But what he decides is that he goes to buy a landing in a horrible place. And it will take care of a kindergarten. And it was impressive. Like a person, writes. It's that for him, taking care of a garden wasn't doing time. It wasn't, well. Going through the mouse. Not like now that we spend the mouse cooking without bread or whatever. Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks that are forbidden are those." And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism. From Free Gengers, basically. And that, more specifically, the feminist weapon. To talk about reproductive work, not even the productive work, which is the one that puts new things in the world, we can say, or whether it's a father or a key, it doesn't matter, and this is a reproductive job that is to reproduce the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook the work for the next day to put the factories or the productive work. And the feminist took a long time, right? By increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also work. But in general, what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory. Now, why the fat of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value? It's even more, why don't we do it as an excrement and think that difference is contrast? Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more infective difference given by one side. And it's also given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that makes the original, that produces the new model in the world that the subject takes care of. No, take care of it. It's something that doesn't make you special, you're not originating, you're an artist, you don't make you think, you're not an important person. These are values we don't have to accumulate. Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days? We are living without writers. Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning. But the world kept spinning without food. Without care. And without nurses. And without health. The only thing that allows us today. Is it comar? And he invented. And yes, that's the world of energy. That's it. Those tasks? They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value. And not only that, but what? It's not something mechanical that we would necessarily have to go through the river, that hope it wouldn't exist, that maybe you could do it, clean it almost, cook, nor solve food. It can, we can think about it. We thought about it for a long time. But what I thought when I read to Germans is that... Just as well, to live them in a different way. Let's live them? Like tasks that have wisdom, like tasks in which they also have. We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what title is not modern nature, modernity. The human being separated from the natural world. Just to do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but also the relationship of care with nature. It's also something interesting. The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that we have to take care of the body, the gym or the gym. cooking. Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter. He looked at me. This is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are. And that the body will do something we have to overcome. I don't think so. This is not an opportunity. And, in fact, I want to return to my life. No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write the same novel, that's how life is. No, we all live in this contradiction and life for absurdity. Now. Data, the world needs more novelty. I thought, "Well. Why not? Instead of obsessed with being productive in these days. And to know all the colors and with all that, why not think? To connect with the world, with the body, with the care of others, in another way, from that. That's why, when they invited me to do this passive, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide that the novel and the world didn't need any other idea. But that's why I thought, we were going to write it. To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already taking care of. I had with my books and I wanted to tell other people, right? More than writing, reading. And more, what to do? Thank you very much. People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they're not going to eat: no more bread, no more sweet, no more stress, no more 15 days... These foods don't bother. What matters is the misunderstanding and disordered way we consume them, but I want to name them three key aspects. The first is consciousness: to have a good food, once a teacher told me: "The consciousness is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. To our desires, so if consciousness is secondary. We would never choose a food we wanted to eat. But on the contrary, the one we like the most, and later, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating, and in what quantity. Thank you. A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger. Because when we have a man, there's no blood of apple. Zamber of everything, Zamber Borasi, the most caloric, and the desire becomes moving to that or to those food we wanted to eat. Thank you very much. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attentive, right? The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas. Believe, ugly, furniture with double weight. So, going back to the subject. Are we really capable? To say "pixa", "No thank you," I prefer a "guardolf." Impossible, right? The second aspect is practice: eating, like every process in life, is learned. And in this case, and in many cases. That my include laughs and learns. (Laughter) We must learn to eat in station, what does this mean? In other words, eating the food that have been harassed at that time. This will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and by making a god in our health. Because because the proper foods of their time are the most natural foods. They are the richest foods in nutrients and they are not chemically treated to subsist in time. That is to say, they are not additioned with calories. It's necessary for our body, or it's normal to see fruit all year, or it's normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer. So this mechanism has led us to practice where we won't fall into the monotony of always eating the same. The last aspect that for me is one is not smaller, but it's one of the most important in moderation. Thank you very much. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxieties. I have a question. They also give them anxieties. To repeat the plate of purchasing with frites? KA: To think, right? (Laughter) What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates? I say that hunger is not handling. If they restrict food, if they get out of food, what is not consumed in the day will be consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion. To be more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top. Every time with more size, every time with more volume. And every time with more strength. So if we don't stop each three, four hours. To take a collection. That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat. And we're going to disappoint all the food around us. (Applause) And to finish? Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose and not. The most expart body becomes to reserve, and when I mean to reserve, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body. Let's go. The food only makes you fat, it depends on us, we leave in favor of that ignorance, the food can hurt you or be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and in what amount. Well, I return to moderation. So, as the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, it should exist a coma with moderation, such food stimulates overweight. To give him a closet. I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like. Being varied, but always taking care of the portion. Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desajuna as a king," "The death as a prince" and "sene" as I mentioned. I think many of us know it, the student has excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have it, I think many of them die of hunger." We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly, thank you very much. (Applause) A while ago I'm obsessed by telling stories of scientific women: I love the first one that seemed obvious to me: Marie Curie. They didn't give a Nobel Prize, they gave them two, so they deserved their pedestal, but there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize, but they made incredible things, recently I entered the story of Ugeneas Ardote. Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war. And I made great contributions, among them, the most important one was the one that brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s, thanks to it, thousands of lives were saved, I am a scientist and more or less since 2002 that I work at university doing research. Eugenia works actively until 2004. And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to her. And do you know what? It died in 2011, I was 111 years old. I found her very little. And how did I lose it, they didn't give us an idea to the bronk that this gave me, to have entered them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who went. But above all, to not lose those who are, thank you very much. We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography. Children keep losing a lot of time in school. With ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. Is there a new ortography missing? I think so. It's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have. Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language. They come by bouncing it from the century for a long time. Since in 1992, in the first grammar of the Castellan language. Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle. That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write. Each sound should correspond to a lyrics. Each letter should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound. They had to eliminate themselves. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today. It's because Spanish has different languages such as English or French. I always had a strong resistance to write too different. How do we pronounce? But it's not. Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing. There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological. The one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and that's how we stay with walls we write, but we don't pronounce. That's how we stayed with long and short waves that, unlike what many people never believed in the pronouncement of the Spanish. That's how we created Conges. Sometimes they sound aspers, like in people. And sometimes they sound soft, like a fool. That's how we stay with six, six, and seats. There are three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but none to three. I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience. We all went to school. We all invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and child brain. Indicted. In the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions. They brought us in many implications and explanations the idea that in ortography something was fundamental in our training. However, I have the feeling. Until teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled? What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you ask the answer, it's much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes. orthography is useful. To uniform writing. so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it. But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example. In ortography there is no individual ability involved in punctuation itself. With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no. With ortography, or is it good or bad? According to Juste or not to the smart norms. But then it wouldn't be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the old norms? So that all that time we dedicate him to teaching ortography. We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort. What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want. The language is a common use tool. Therefore, it seems fundamental that we use it following common criteria. But it also seems fundamental to me that those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done. Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down when ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all. I work every day with the literature of the Ourolego, Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo, that sometimes they write: "Men, signs, sometimes they write, write, with a decoration." And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality. But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story. I mentioned that insistence a little reflected with which teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography. But the truth is that being things like you are, that makes sense. In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is written: you can get or stop getting a job by a H. You can become a bubble object, because of a misunderstanding bird. So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography. But we shouldn't forget. Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers. Or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography there was sometimes a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge, in our case, for example, safety, which had already had a place in the Spanish language, which was in Chile. Middle Ages. In the 19th century. Why not take the bet on those teachers? And start advancing in our ortography, me here, in the intimacy of us, 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. Let's eliminate the mood H. There, where we wrote an H, but we didn't pronounce anything, we couldn't be any, we can discuss, sit down, each of us will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument, that we don't eliminate the other: "Ge, Je, Je, we divide the Swabe, Gato, Mago, Aguila," and that the jump retains the sound "Asperó." Jalabe, giraffe, people. Argentine. And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended, now I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two and three letters, we go down to two. We are all better. Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not so much. The Real Academy Spanish, all the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified. That language is connected to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that attachment to history, traditions and customs are transformed into a obstacle. It's for today's use. That explains that our language is much more. That those we know that we have geographically close, were modifying historically in us, for example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol to symbol, and, little by little, now, they start to remove each other, harmony, they can write with H or synacy. And we're all fine. Does it look like me? That this is a moment. Especially appropriated to face this discussion. It always tells us that language changes spontaneously, below, up. They are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications. And that authority, in some places, is a academic in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts them and incorporates them. This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above to low, they were always the institutions that fixed the norms, it's less true for the level of words. And they proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment? Until today. The writing has always had a much more restricted and private use it speaks. But at our time, the time of social networks. This is suffering a revolutionary change. It never was written as much as now. They never wrote so much to the view of so many. And in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school, novelous ortographic uses. where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks. It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication. Now, that's it. There are chaotic, individual uses. But I think we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that follows the writing, a new place, is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would do badly to reject them. To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinable norm with the needs of our times. I can anticipate some objections. Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, we wouldn't reach ortography, we should learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with a simplified ortography, we will go to recover etymology at the same place we go now, to etymological dictionary. A second observation of those who say, "If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguishing between these words that are different in only one letter, that's true, but it's not a problem." Our language has omonyms, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit the money, the tragic we put ourselves from the situations, the context dissipates any confusion. But there's a third objection. For me? It's more comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one of those who say. I don't want to change. I educate myself like this. I got used in this way when I read a word written in simplified ortography: "My eyes hurt." (Laughter) That objection is within each one of us. What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to? And it is expected that time feels the new norms. The success of all ortographic reform that touches so arraigated habits. It's in the prudence the consensus, the fat-alism and tolerance. But we can't let the rule, the old customs, prevent us from going forward. The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive, so I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography. All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't serve us. I'm convinced that if we do that in the modest environment, but very important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a better future. (Applause) Before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes. I had the eyes of coffee with a joy around Liris. After his death, reality didn't make sense, I didn't hide those eyes and tell myself, "I had to understand life and death." (Audience talking) Perhaps by my training as a photographer. Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope. For the surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images, the discovery that made my view of the world transformed. Well, the whole universe inside my mind. (Laughter) It was like being floating in the universe. It's like being that space. A expansive space, without body. It was absolute content. It became peace. This image. Do you see it? This is the image of the seeds of my microscope father. And this other is the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite. All my fear and my sadness disappeared. I didn't feel disconnection from anything or anyone. (Laughter) Your death, more than a movie. He represented the beginning where today is the project of my life. Let's see the project. For me, this is teaching. That our most pure material essence. We are scared by the cosmos. And that when we look at the mirror. There is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe. And that matter doesn't believe nor is destroyed. It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. Thank you. In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy. And space technology. His satellites travel around the planet. It's the best example, maybe we have. The ability the state has to innovate. We shouldn't create. A bubble of education. Imagine a public agency. That designs content and strategies to transform learning. That I work with schools to rewrite what happens in classrooms. That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale. A agency with pedagogists. Designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you. For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term. They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture. A mystic of innovation in public management. The first step. It's thinking about the state as a possibility. Not like the variable of all the adjusts. Just like that, changes in education. They won't benefit the most advantages. (Applause) I'm not a scientist, and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in extraordinary situations. From big loves, extraterrestrial invasions. Until pandemic. Until the fiction made reality. And here and now, at home. We don't stop asking questions. From the most extraordinary corners of human condition. Until the most ridiculous and the most worldwide. For example, the world obsession could buy mountains of paper. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous. Who is biological unconscious? In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the opposite. It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive. And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy. It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public. And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of Mayan psychology. It's called optimistic dry. The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages. Thinking that, in fact, it won't happen to us. It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity for time. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals. Why does this happen now? To us. And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas. For example, in the Ugonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States. When, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease. In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to avoid people who are already sick with other people. However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs. This first makes people who are healthy or count and this is very important, but there's another most important reason: if they don't use maskets, we get sick. So this would be a sort of accusatory excuse. Knowing who is sick and who doesn't use the most expensive names. That they use it all over the world is a way of avoiding self-esteem. We have to take care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered the most in these days is our extraordinary capacity for change. In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do it. This is what we discovered until now, when we thought that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change. And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home. We don't know some consequences of this. But we learned that we are willing to do it if we need to learn. And the world keeps going. Also, of course, they change our values, our judgment. It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started. The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible then. That everyone has to stay at home doesn't seem completely priority. And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment? It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future. Imagine the next situation. We're at the beginning of the pandemic. A public consorcio that includes the Organization of Salud. But also Government and other public sector has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move, who we find. And also data of our body intimacy. Our temperature, our respiratory frequency. Maybe our face is viral. And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who. Let's suppose that this consption can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way. The one who is at home, the one who is at risk, can go out. Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of the pyramid. It doesn't disappear completely, but it dies a lot less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them is still true. There's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic? And I could choose if it looks good or bad to do this. What would you do? I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is. On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom. They are fundamental values, pillar in our culture. On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics. Maybe we have our data a little like vaccinating us. It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact. To take care of us. And everyone. A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom. We found a good solution of commitment. Sex. Compreservative. When all this happens. What will the balance we want to get to feel free and care? Are you going to fly less airplanes in the sky? Will we change the way we greet? Are we okay to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home. Do we have an opportunity to think freely than ever? What do we want, which is the conservative sex of the coronavirus? (Applause) My first encounter with a fossil. It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina. I had been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me. But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field. The middle of nowhere. An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before. The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind, we call it "dolars of sea," are relatives from sea herits. And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years. So, at that moment... I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out. And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know. They are extremely fragile, the sea dollar broke down, the sand fell. And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way. But... I'm not interested in fossils or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past. They kept captivating me. And they took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet. About 100 million years ago. Our planet was very different as the one today: it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated. For dinosaurs and other raptile groups. And I told you 100 million years ago. It's a number that we paleontologists do. We mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people. Well, imagine each one of you. It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people. 10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a quantity. That it doesn't enter the head. And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life. It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter. In my head. But well, life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago, it's traveled. Deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it also led me. A very special place. What is Patagone? And when we say "patagonia." KA: We naturally think of these landscapes, forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes. But for us, paleentologists. Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered. We know, fortunately, many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world. To look for dinosaurs, and the great majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia is the last period in which dinosaurs lived on Earth. What we call critical period. This is already about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere. The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while, at that time, in the northern hemisphere, other kinds of carnivores, like, for example, the dinosaurs. Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the north of the South wasn't. Surprising because at that time, a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the northern hemisphere. But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before? At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea. And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the healing hemisphere. And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet. His key hand, especially 60 million years ago, when dinosaurs for the first time. They dominated the planet completely. For the first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores of omnivores in the whole planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years. With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic. And that leads me to one of the stories of the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found it four years ago, in hills like this, walking. A lot of heat afternoon. After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between rocks, on the floor. And I approached the idea that I was approaching. It was becoming more clearly what it was. It was the traffic of a dinosaur. I approached, stood next to me, stood up. I was really ice cream. I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, I knew perfectly what the track was of a carnivor dinosaur. But really? I couldn't believe it. I knew it was one of those discoveries that happened. Very few times in life. Leoa. To warn the rest of the team. And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task. To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum. And we started to take it low. But the expedition was over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum. Until the next time given that the winter came. It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the channel we had found. Or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day. From the stadium. We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rare. Very good. In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions. Clearly, the animal was dead. A layer of a lake and she has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way her sketch. And that's when the scalp really begins: reading, straightening, cap, those sediments that were burning. Where you open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time you're going back to the surface. An animal? That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago. Luckily, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, and that food was being transformed into sediment rocks, and in that same process the bones turned into fossil fuels for chemical reactions. After all that package of dry rocks, he had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming. From all this block. And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover. The layer I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills. Searching. Those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting. Going discovering juices is a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun. The Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry. All this rest is protected by layers to the lab. In the lab, the museum begins another extremely long stage, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big. All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs. And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus. Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relievable parent of the South hemisphere. And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before. What we thought. (Laughter) A lot before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent. Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there. For example, of some rocks like these that we carry to the museum, knowing that there is fossil, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab. We discovered the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks. A skeleton was quite complete and told with a very well preserved meat and with very strange teeth. Dents in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "manidance." Now, this dinosaur is very particular. For something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world. What I have here is a replication of this dinosaur. It's a dinosaur. Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end of the tail. And this mining of dinosaurs didn't look like the forms we found or knew about the North hemisphere, studying their rest, we could see that their closest relatives. They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same kindness, and this wasn't so surprising because if you see it in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of Pangea. It hasn't been formed by the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents, but we had a case again. In other words, restricted animals, only from the hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the northern hemisphere. We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern. And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived at this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century. It was a great success what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere: it was the lack of water. What I had isolated these aunts wasn't a desert full of water. And when we think about dinosaurs? And we found fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really found fantastic organisms, fascinating. They have challenged the limits of the body size in life's history. They have diversified and conquered all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing is that. It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet. And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives. Learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years on our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. KA: The Earth is a big book. With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years. And life. It occupies a prepondering place. In this story, in the last 3800 million years. And there are millions of pages yet by reading this book. And if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today. It's fundamental to know your story. Because knowing the past. It's key to understand the present. "Yes." It's also key. To design a future. (Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid. I wanted to have superpowers. anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies. I dreamed of competing. To contain magical powers to build things. I dreamed of defending small lands of terrible invasors. Well, time is. It's not a quality bathroom. It's through subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter. I see without empathic periods, small villages. And you don't have the passion of patterns to defend them. But something about that child's vocation. It stayed in me and almost without realizing it. I dedicated myself to looking. And trying to understand how these superpowers work. They are not my imagination. But in the real world. Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop. One of the main superpowers. Maybe the most important thing in this situation. To live. What is the superpower of thinking better? Obviously, there are many more superpowers. And many more tools to think better. But today I want to focus on which I think are less known. I'm going to tell you about my ideas, I learned from others. And this is, maybe? The main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you. That we are able to learn. And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed. But it can be developed. Speaking of our mind with it. powerful and practical ideas. So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine they enter a gym. Look. That's on the floor. Papers, neighbors, daughters. Do you give me a round? They go to the bar, have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and it's harmful. It doesn't work like that, right? Our body doesn't recognize better. Well, compensating happens the same. It doesn't count being able to think. What counts is to think. We have to practice thinking. To develop ourselves is the habit. We need to think and give time to think. Intelligence is not something that has one. It's something we use or we don't use. The second one. Do you see the saying? Who only sees a sheet, who only has a sheet? They see all the problems as a key. But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress. Neither to realize their keyboard. If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing. And if we need to cut something, we need a bear. Do you have a box of tools? With more tools it allows us to do more things, to solve more problems. And tools are usually called mental models. If we only have a mental model? Let's think about all the problems with that model. As if they tried to get a t-shirt with a noise. If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful. But where do these mental models find? Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times. For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology. And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina. In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ. In the Middle Ages and in our time. To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads. "No." All the problems will seem a keyboard. The third. Little by little I was in the club and at the side table. A man told his friends. He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher. Go ahead of his son and his classmates. Or a mistake that the teacher had committed. Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him something. That's it. But he didn't realize it. What about it? In other words, this. I was creating a much greater evil. In South America. I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends. And I was unpleasant to the teacher. In front of all the children who had to learn from them. Many times we don't realize it. To be focused on earning a scale. You don't know how to have success in that scale. And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in our most important scale. To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example. A disguise and a freedom. Or with freedom and losing love. When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do. And what is the most important scale? In which we have to think how to act. The fourth one. The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. And the impression is to have emotions. And emotions make us act. For example, in the pandemic. We arrived a lot of Chinese situations. But those acts didn't have impressions. They generated emotions. And they did not act. When they started to get there. Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China. These implications are generated in emotion. Fear. And fear generates action. We are all now watched, preventively, what is dying. We were lucky that fear gave us time. Because someone has come to us before. But many times. It's important to act when we still don't see and feel. The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. "Casar is a thing." Do you have hunger? Did you get married? You have an immediate reward, you eat what you get married. But cultivating is very different. Do you make the effort now? For something that will take place between six months or a half. This is the pillar of almost everything we have. But let's earn to generate applause. Because you're avoiding something. That nobody is a benicient. But except lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling. That is to say, we develop our ability to anticipate. It's one of the main abilities to think well. Let's think a minute. What do we have to anticipate? Now. That we still feel, we live. In the fifth? We all evaluate things according to our expectations. If something bad lasts three months and we think we would last six months. We are happy. If something bad, it lasts three months and we think it was going to last. The month is sad. It's the same time, it's three months. But we live them completely different. If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example. In kilometers, we are exhausted. If we program to run 20. Nine kilometers are unbearable. We make a culte of resilience. But the key of resilience is to handle expectations well. The sixth and last one. Have you ever met a well-known place? You're walking through a chicken in the middle of the ship. A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago. When you can create an unlikely chance to find something in that place. What truth is, finding that classmate, in that place, is something totally unlikely. But as we know so many people. It's very likely. To find someone in a very unlikely place. In fact, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of life is the same. There are so many unlikely things. It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us. The problem is that our mind. It makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future. We don't know what will happen. Neither now, my field with more normal times. We have to learn to live with uncertainty. And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty. To always leave many open doors. Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible. Of serious things, even if they are very likely. And if someone ever asks you? Why do you always have cars with the tank of "hash full"? Specifically. Why once? You found yourself in a town on the other side of the world. With a high school classmate that I didn't see those 15 years ago. I told you at the beginning that I wanted to do with this talk. Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn. And learning has to do with being accepted. To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking. And people. With which we cultivate these ideas. We can surround people that enrich our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others. It's about changing our own ideas. A 40-year-old interview. Entrevistator is a question. And when Borges replied. The interviewed told me, "This same thing happened to me." That same question four years ago. "Morophes, do you want a box?" He looked at him. And he said. I ask for excuses. It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years. Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live. To be accepted by new ideas. The new cities are emerging. And being open to change our way of thinking. Thank you. KA: Women are irrational beings, always given to emotional disorder. That's why they need the custodian of a men. which is the rational of the family. At the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of. This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for children and young people's education on marriage. Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930. But the idea, yes. It has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915 no country in the world could vote women. In 2015, that is, hundreds of years later, 65 countries are governed by women. In 1910. (Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize. (Laughter) But the French science Academy said that he didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of those who are here had already finished the primary. The University of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, left a woman to be a master's degree. Hale University admired women in 1972. The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow. This was this idea. That women only serve to create children. It helps the husband. It's a rational series. What a cistery! It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment. And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they believed this idea. It was a true fact. Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed? Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived in, the idea that truth is true. The idea that truth is a lie. There are not facts, they only exist interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world. 2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem. Now neurobiologists. And cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the objective world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it. When you say that there is no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium. That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. What is an interpretative mark, what day is it today? 24th September. Does anyone doubt it? What day is it for you? Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because we're all here, we agree with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist. On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, the cats live without calendar. My dog applies to the chest, and who is very lonely at home. No, making some misfortune. I didn't know the time, I knew what I was going back. It doesn't look at the clock. If human beings didn't have it. These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world. That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree. He looked at a blanket, wrote the law of gravity: "What a genius!" But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, I would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution. I would have missed the trips I made, know the animals I saw, everything that had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides... And what about it? To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print. It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea. The wise, the geniuses, are those able to synthesize an idea. But the time is what it generates. The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born. But it was born in the 19th century. The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same thing happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing happens with what we are thinking about now, and the same political and social change is revolutionary. How did we see it? For thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and raised the children. And yet. In less than 100 years they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost in humanity to think more than to clean panels. How much was humanity lost, how many medicines, how much intelligence? How much creativity? In other words, errones are monsters. There's an idea we can do it. To follow because it was created a century and a half ago, and that example, to study this process. What is the creation of homosexuality? Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world. You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, there were always, in every culture, at all times. They are even documented in many animal species outside of humans. But I had never thought about it. That the sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity. It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A. Moral Víctorian, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak. The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex when something we want to do doesn't have turbies. You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you fault, it's not true, it's a great social control... (Applause) You don't wish the woman of your fellow man. (Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man, no, that is. It will give you guilt, it will give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it, and then that's a form of terrible social control because it dominates us, probably, on the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they were given us to eat. We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, a waste bathroom where everything that was wrong is the society of the sexual point of view and put it there. The homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks that were born out of slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves. It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, none of the situations today is ideal. But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century. Fifty years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals have full right, but there's a paradigm drama, and because this paradigm change allowed the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all the opressed, take their identity back, and then make the other understand that they are also human beings who have full right, but in any other parts, we didn't have no right to the marriage. To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish. (Laughter) To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, like a black man, only black, and the same only gay. And if you win the women, the Jews, the blacks, the big ones, we are all complete, complex people, contradictories, that maybe I don't have the desire to like that, but, however, we have to take that. Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison. Of the jails. 50 years ago they were old today. I was a homosexual child. I didn't know what a homosexual child was, I didn't know the homosexual word, and my colleagues told me, "I agree, I'm going to turn around," (Laughter) and I didn't know what it was, I caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that my father, who loved me, looked at me. And it made me feel. What would I have done so that it come out like that? What was it like that? I had to learn what to be like that, I had to learn how to be homosexual. I had to turn less homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. To assume the identity there is. I had a positive side. I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. I stopped being a person. And I'm a person, like any other person in the world. With trajectory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince the others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings. And it took me 50 years to learn. That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity. 20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had. It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist. (Laughter) (Applause) There are the contradictions and I'm going to say, because really that, we are contradictory, the facts exist in interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend me, and now I want to go, I said, and when I sign it, because when I don't mobilize it, while we only have the head doesn't serve it. I made her body, I left prison. And I left my prison, it was so wonderful. Have you thought about staying? I'm not there or they told me that there is a list of things we need to survive: the basics channel. What an idea of living constantly with this canasta, Mexico, San Pedro, our community, contains the things we need to survive, and if better we had the things we need? How can we explore? But exploring is something difficult, terrifying, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, to adapt, it's a moment. Of course or small: full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know disappears. When everything you did, you've paid for the voices of someone else, you've had a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas, and besides all those ghosts that obsteculize it, but once you say it, once you take a avalanche and ideas that come towards you all speed. Each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate. But some of these ideas are rain and you are able to choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side and in part with each one of them. Each moment is a combination of energy, of following, of getting up, jumping or running. But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated: learning to harm your own movement. A class isn't called. With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, and that even if life controls music, movements, I believe them, movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing. Moments. They keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories in a note, memories that probably won't be a work of art, but they would allow you to review the exact way those stars saw. The formula you saw on the face when you spoke about what you loved the most, the speed I took to your heart. Or how do you start talking to you? That voice, that voice that you so much know, that you probably are looking for something you lose. That voice, your best friend. It's not enough and always. It will be the first to defend yourself, the first to walk in a little kitchen to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it. That person is your best friend. A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend. Without that, without that, I can't survive. What we created in girls' cities. I'm sure we chose one. The opportunity to get out of me is nothing to do, I can't go to a portable job, I can't progress in the way I would like. (Laughter) There, a person always appears for what they will have been there for years. Keep calm and with a bread, you remember your experience, but Federica. (Laughter) Do you remember that all the time spent was better? (Laughter) It's really like that. Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us. To think about this, inevitably, I remember my friends of all life, and Juancho, Ranco in Manuel. These photos that are seeing there. It's 2009 when I live in secondary school. What can I tell you about my friends? That I really want them to be like my brothers and that they are three capable people who, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to stay like to study what they liked, stayed here in the city. And go to surprise, until today, you can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams. While I want to be in this photo. A lack of opportunities was also present, my biologists, who are workers, made an effort on humans so that I could study what I liked. Because I knew that I didn't even know that if I stayed here in the city... I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be short of opportunities. Have you ever wondered why these things happen? We live in full 21st century. We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization. In which successes and advances are called a revolution that surprise us all and above the borders and barriers that insists between people, and in this context. Cities to be more and more important. Let's make sense, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. (Laughter) It is estimated that for the year 2050. A 68% of the world's population will live in a city. Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would be almost 100 out of 10 people in the whole world. Seven decades. If each other more people choose to live in cities. And it's that fall where we have the greatest chance to cry. And what do they explain, then, that while the city stops falling in time, other progresses, vibrants, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them? (Laughter) I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to go to the cow when you get out of that door to return home: strategy. If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. (Laughter) Besides my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely for this. To connect cities with opportunities that the world has to offer. Not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities, and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. Now you'll tell me, "How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?" Through complete projects. What improves the quality of life of the population? They avoid immigration. Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends. This is a photo, a few months ago, and so you can write a couple of things, to start, we add a fifth friend, friend, proud of the group, do you know what it is? The girlfriend of drugs. Secondly, we can also say that it's a sort of universal relationships are decorating the quality of the strengths of the phones. We're in it, we're improving, some of us have a couple of threads, but we have to make a mirror. (Laughter) Do you know what we share today beyond the deepest times we have the body with us? The brand of the lack of opportunities. Franco, for example, is the one that is also made of her. It was a national champion of geography units in 2012. A national champion. But today, although it's left to dedicate to studying a school teacher, it doesn't have time because it has to be from Monday to Monday working to be able to live. Then, you're hot, you think my left is better, that I like to go to the subway. I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the strength of security in the country. But, as I didn't vote with that possibility here, from then on, I'm changing the career without finding what really is passionate, and I can't get a job that allows a certain economic independence. (Laughter) Lastly, it's manual that it's a genius of mutation, but they don't know what genius is. But do you realize? Every day we worked in their local that built from nothing itself. Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs. The worst of all this that I'm telling you about. It's that we, as young people, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing. (Laughter) Remember that I had the huge fortune to be the election between a group of 8 young children at a worldwide level. To participate in a weekend, in New Day, the capital of India. I traveled the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinian in that event. (Audience) Yes! Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back. I learned a lot. But if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following. There are millions that I will never be able to say it with the sufficient lamp so that you can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities outside. But we have to be willing to find them, they don't come alone. Our human resources as Argentines are brilliant. I don't have one to ask the best to be obvious, nor to the kids, nor to anyone. Do you know what the differences we don't have? What do you want? And a state that is present to get out of the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them. Once again. We want cities to be strategically exhausted in the world. Remember? When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could study with three days to fulfill 18 banks. I was very scared, with a lot of fear. (Laughter) This can never be found in public. Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult for your city. What to study? It's like leaving a piece of your heart. Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by. Maraquette: "I'm going to spend the voice." Do you have friends? And nobody you know? (Laughter) It's necessary to give them tools to our young people so they stay in their cities and grow from the city. (Laughter) In the end, who is more beautiful than giving wings to the city who had to do it. And with one of the strategies we can do. Imagine the brilliant who would have been white. If I'm going to be able to add completely to geography. Or for us to go so far, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to be able to go. Is it like that? Ah, yeah! That's it. You see the lack of opportunities. "Yes." All of this. And I'm telling you. It doesn't seem enough arguments. Do you want a more example? F: Fear well. (Audience) This one. It's the tattoo. And they tell me, "When, finally, I could overcome the depth of the 20th depression." In which I fell, I'll have my city's country. Two suicide methods. In numeral, psychological sequels. And he told me. Thank you very much for your supermarket. If we want these things to stop passing? We have to go out strategically. We don't take a final point to our cities, thank you very much. (Applause) I'm a surgeon. Since always, surgeons. We think that to have more work. We have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. In my last 10 years? My research. In my case, in the zoo, it was based. To look for the reasons. To operate less and less to patients. This can be done in several ways, for example, looking for genes. To detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair. For themselves. using their own ability to regenerate. That's it. We do it. With biological platforms. That they are like maps. That we give it to the tissue. To use their own capacity. To restore yourself after a damage. And finally, with new technologies. We can, for example, with an endoscope. To make procedures. And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out. Robotics are giving us a lot of tools. To facilitate these tasks. What seemed science fiction before. Today it's almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge. My own paradigms of... To have more and more patients to operate. It gave me many satisfactions. What about me? And a lot of patients. That they avoided. We have to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized. That developing methods, increasingly invasive. What do I have? Every time? More work. I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. Audience: Yes. I'm not a doctor. My mother is Japanese, and I think that certain behaviors and answers, social and individually have had contact with sociological issues of Japanese culture, can help us when facing a crisis like this. It's worth asking us a first question. Why Japan? I was able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage. If in January the first case came out. I'm so close to the neighbour. Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space. In other words, having the populations of the third age of older people in the world. (Applause) Being in the second country with more fumers for many inhabitants. Why, Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth? but a linear advance. And the identified. Until now. We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious. In these demographic status, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease, basically. Many people, in a little place. And a fourth of that people with more than 65. What happens then? Japanese is a society. Educed in such a way that responds organic and humidly to any event that compromises it. Japan went through wars, Tifones, his name. Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year. Mil temblors per day. Generation, transgeneration has had to overcome catastrophes. Naturally co-generated by man. This is what we can think with something that likes Argentines a lot: football teams. Like an example. What kind of soccer will it have better performance before a critical moment? The team that trains every day. It has infrastructure where each one knows what to do. Or the team that never trained. It doesn't have infrastructure. And it has to come out to improvise. The directives of social distancing. And that's it, right? And individual behavior. Whether it's in society or at home. The Japanese population hasn't established you for hundreds of years. She doesn't need to say, "Don't embrace." Don't give kiss, because they don't do it. It greets with a reverence. In other words, giving distance is a gesture of respect. And most of the workers in public places use a lot. It's not necessary to recommend to get out of shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used. (Laughter) We don't have to invite, we don't have to turn our third on another person. Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese. In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected. Not to protect yourself, but to protect others. Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture. In other words, the good of everything. It's more important to sell a part. To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan. I will surely know the game of the chairs. You put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and you get out of one. In each round. And he did this experience in Japan. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all. Seeing the place to a classmate. Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers. The word " japonesa" loves. It expresses this way of being. It's about having confidence that the other will take care of me, in resonance with feeling that we realize when we take care of others. In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works. (Laughter) Do you help yourself? Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
