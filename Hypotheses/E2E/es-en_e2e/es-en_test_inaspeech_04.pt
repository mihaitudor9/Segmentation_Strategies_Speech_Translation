(Laughter) I have a message for their children and grandchildren.
And I need you to help me swimming.
It's very simple.
We need it.
Learn to feel.
To think and act sustainable harmony with nature.
A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lomboca's star, in Indonesia.
At 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity of recipes, corals, tortures, mold fish.
And from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature.
It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience.
So, at that moment, I observed a small fish.
Are you fragile?
Negers and yellow came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me.
We were looking at each other.
And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated.
Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking.
It was a very spiritual feeling.
I do what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right?
It's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell it, look at each other.
And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy."
(Laughter)
And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist.
KA: The work 24 hours during a week.
To draw that artwork we're going to see, that mandate we see proves that nature has consciousness, and that I don't block you, or, on the contrary, the maritime stream is taken to talk to fish.
Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants?
With rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena.
I think so.
In fact, I bring you more scientific tests.
Last year, the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse symbols were analyzed.
Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between inmates and predators.
In other words, for every four bottles, there were three lions.
Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right?
Paradoxically, from amazing forms to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced.
I agree with the law of Cleber.
A elephant that has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse.
But three rooms.
And if they stop thinking about it.
The planet we live in.
It's made of three quarters of water.
Right?
So I ask myself.
Is it a mere coincidence?
Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness?
After thousands and thousands of years of intersist coevolution.
That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research.
That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify.
The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being.
That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here I bring you a summary.
And I agree with the scientific consensus, with the entire cells, with the complex expression of the oxygen appeared in the atmosphere and the miracle of life, between 3800 and 3.500 million years old, during the first housing strategy, the Earth was formed between 4,000 million years.
The Homo sapiens is the only survivor of the human species that co-evolution in the planet Earth, since the revolution of the Greek dinosaurs that domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years, the human being has been adapted to the environment in a transcendental way, as something unbearable.
It's 130 species.
In a 30-year-old Parliament or maybe 100 million species?
A single species?
Isn't it more?
It's destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species, and that's if it's being there.
We are all responsible.
(Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs.
But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him.
This half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them.
If it seems we've forgotten from Hirosim and Nagasaki, we've built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb.
Why do you get an idea?
Keeping the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach the 65 million degrees centuries.
And that's why it was little.
Generations are future.
Are you well threatened?
Or the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breast, our mother Earth.
Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth.
Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity.
According to the World Cup of nature?
If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours.
But we don't have four planets, right?
That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think.
And act in harmony with nature.
Besides, the use of...
fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, have created a big global warming.
And what does this mean?
Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater.
And we take fire to the bottles where you are sitting.
Yes, imagine it.
You already know the barbari, right?
Well, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren.
A chronic scenario of natural resources will be able to develop it in a dignified way.
That's why people learn to cooperate.
Darwin told us that they only survive the strongest, the ones who best adapt to the middle.
But he forgot to define the concept of cooperation.
If it's true, there is violence and predation and excess, in any way.
In life, in nature, what defines it.
It's not competence, but cooperation.
I'll give you an example.
Imagine millions of spermatozoids.
Crossing, fighting, competing, to reach a novel, to fertilize it.
What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a ovule between two different entities that create a new one.
That defines life, cooperation.
The football, for example.
We all know that a team competes against another.
But what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind.
Our body?
Is it a pluricerular organism?
Where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are.
Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time has suffered catástrofes of meteorites and constant processes of trial and error.
In other words, human beings have a great ideology of linear thinking.
Political toxins such as anarchism that failed the communism, which also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has also failed.
A Oxfan study, last year, said that 1% of the richest people in our planet have more money than the rest 99.
That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren.
That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because nature is signed to obtain economic benefits, we've sent the sweat to the bottom of the sea.
The money has colonized life.
And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature.
Because biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems.
Right?
My life, my goal, imitation, imitation of life.
But this is not new, the originary villages are already born, the indigenous people, for thousands of years.
It's something inside us, we all have that faculty, and I invite you.
To make a game.
What an imaginary!
What happens to this veruga?
How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us?
Well, it happened to them.
A plane.
What would happen to them with the peak of the Martín Bolador?
The Japanese did the train Bala.
And with this Murciélago.
We could make a trunk, right?
And with this laboratory ardilla.
We could learn to fly.
With termites.
We could make bioclimatic buildings.
This is Girasol.
A plant of solar boards.
As we know, there are millions of species in nature.
Pio-inspiration is practically infinite.
But do we keep thinking that nature?
It will be there forever.
And we have to overcome the cognitive face of the GDP.
What does the GDP mean?
Many economists tell us that we have to make, build.
To climb so much percent of economy every year.
But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material.
For the industry.
We have to be aware of it.
That the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a prestigious one of our children and our children.
And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started?
Imagine.
Do we have a future to dialogue?
With their children and grandchildren.
I would like you to tell me.
At least you try it, fight.
And you?
What would you like to hear?
Thank you very much.
(Applause) What I have to say is that the quarantine is not an opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, they are horrible things, we're going to do everything missing.
But it has many complicated consequences, politically.
It's economical, less.
We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our friends.
This doesn't happen at all, it's the respect, and it's not because thinking it's an opportunity to take advantage of and that we're not part of it, and it's a great moment to learn, it's a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment.
Do you say that?
Life doesn't hesitate anything else, that happens horrible moments and learn from them: we learn pain, disease.
We're going to move the war, the death, we're always achieved if we're going to happen.
So what?
That's what we're going to do now.
And what I didn't think about André?
It's an idea in which I was meditating from a book.
It's called modern nature, but it's the right to the world.
These are the newspapers that took me to the 80s.
When do I give you a chance?
And then he decides to go back to his childhood to the gardenery, but that's not a kid who, in fact, later, diagnosed.
They are a lot of very important movies, some of the most important ones in their career.
But what he decides is that he goes to buy a landing in a horrible place.
And it will take care of a kindergarten.
And it was impressive.
Like a person who writes.
It's that to take care of a garden it wasn't to be time.
It wasn't, well.
Going through the mouse.
Not like now that we spend the time cooking, making bread or whatever.
Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks that are forbidden are those."
And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism.
From Free Gengers, basically.
And that, more specifically, the feminist weapon.
To talk about reproductive work, the productive work is the one who put new things in the world.
We can say, that is, being a patrium program, a key, doesn't matter.
And this reproductive job is to reproduce the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, take care of, right?
Thank you very much.
I had to cook the workers for the next day to put the factory, their reproductive work.
And the feminist took a long time, right?
By increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also work.
But in order to do what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economical value because it is useful to do productive task, because workers don't eat in factories.
Now, why the fat of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value?
It's even more, why don't we do it as an excellent insult and think that is different and contrast?
Between productive and reproductive work, it's a more infective difference given by one side.
Sure, of course, gender, there are areas that are important, these are the productive, traditionally performed by gold.
And reproductive reproductive revolves through the most important women.
And I've also been given by modernity and the idea that the subject that is worth is the subject that makes the origin, that produces the happiness in the world, that the subject takes care of.
No, take care of it.
It's something that doesn't make you special, you're not originating, making artists.
You don't have to get involved, you don't care.
These are values we don't have to accumulate.
Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days?
We are living without writers.
Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning.
But the world kept spinning without food.
Without care.
And without a nurse.
And without health.
The only thing that allows us today.
How bad?
What did he send?
And without that, the world opens.
Students.
Those tasks?
They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value.
And not only that, but what?
It's not something mechanical that we should have to go through the river, that hope it wouldn't exist, that maybe you could do it, clean it almost, cook, nor solve food.
We can think about it.
We thought about it for a long time.
But what I thought when I read to Germans.
Just put them in living in another way.
Are we going to live them?
Like tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which they also have.
We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what title is not modern nature, modernity.
Human beings have separated.
Is the natural world?
Just to do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but also the relationship of care with nature.
It's also something interesting.
The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that we have to take care of the body.
No, there's the scenario.
cooking.
Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter.
He looked at me.
This is also a very strange way of thinking about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are.
And that the body will do something we have to overcome.
It seems to me that...
This is not an opportunity.
And, in fact, I want to return to my life.
No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is.
No, we all live in this contradiction and life for absurdity.
Now.
Data, the world needs more novelty.
I thought, "Well.
Why not?
Instead of obsessed with being productive in these days.
And to know all the colors and with all that, why not think?
To connect with the world, with the body, with the care of others, in another way, from that.
That's why, when they invited me to do this passive, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide that the novel and the world didn't need any other idea.
But that's why I thought, we were going to write it.
To bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already taking care of.
I had with my books and I wanted to tell other people, right?
More than writing, reading.
And more, what to do?
Thank you very much.
People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they're not going to eat, not bread.
A end of the middle, the hardest, the poorest, every 15 days.
These foods are not fat.
What matters is the misunderstanding and disordered way we consume them, but that's why I want to name three key aspects.
To have a good food.
Well, the first is consciousness.
(Laughter) Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness rate is secondary to brain activity."
And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs.
So, if the consciousness rate is secondary to our desires?
We would never choose a food we wanted to eat.
But on the contrary, the one that doesn't like the most.
And then, what about this?
We are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating.
And in what quantity?
IWR: A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger.
Because when we have a man, there's no blood of apple.
Zamber of everything, Zamber Borace and the most caloric, and desire becomes unmodible to that or to those food we wanted to eat.
I've always prohibited it.
It has been the most attentive, right?
The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas.
Believe, ugly, furniture with double weight.
So, going back to the subject.
Are we really capable?
In other words, Pixa, Nadoracia, prefer a Wardolf.
Impossible, right?
The second aspect is practice: eating, like every process in life, is learned.
And in this case, there are many cases.
That my include reains to learn.
So we must learn to eat in station.
What does this mean?
In other words, eating the food that have been harassed at that time.
This will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and by making a god in our health.
(Laughter) Because foods are made of their own, of their time.
They are the most natural foods.
They are the richest foods in nutrients and they are not chemically treated to subsist in time.
In other words, they are not additioned with calories.
And necessary for our body.
Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or is it normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer?
So this mechanism has led to practice.
It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating the same.
The last aspect?
For me, it's not smaller, but it's from the most important ones in moderation.
(Applause)
Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxieties.
I have a question.
They also give them anxieties.
To repeat the plate of purchasing with frites?
To think, right?
(Laughter)
What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates?
That hunger is not handling.
If they restrict food, if they get out of food, what is not consumed in the day will be consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion.
To do it more graphic, it's like a snowball from the top.
Every time with more size, every time with more volume.
And every time with more strength.
So, if we don't stop each three.
Four hours.
To take a collection.
That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat.
And we're going to disappoint all the food around us.
(Applause)
And to finish...
Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose and not.
The most expart body becomes to reserve, to look.
And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body.
Let's go.
The food doesn't only make you fat.
We leave in favor of ignorance: food can hurt you or be able to cure, it depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and in what amount.
Well, I return to moderation.
And that's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation.
That is, food stimulates overweight.
To give him a closet.
I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like.
Being varied, but always taking care of the portion.
Not for anything, there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "They die as a prince" and "sene" as I mentioned.
I think many of us know it. The student has excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have it there."
It happened to me the hunger, or even worse.
And sometimes I died of hunger.
We have four opportunities a day.
And to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly.
Thank you very much.
For a while, I'm obsessed by telling stories of scientific women: I love the first one that seemed obvious to me: Marie Curie.
When they gave a Nobel Prize, they gave them two, so it deserves his pedestal.
But there are many others who didn't get into a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things recently: I entered the story of Ugeneas Ardote.
Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war.
It made great contributions, among them, the most important thing was the one that brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s.
Thanks to her.
There were thousands of lives saved, I'm a scientist, and more or less since 2002, that I work at university doing research.
Eugenia works actively.
Until 2004.
And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to her.
And do you know what?
It died in 2011, I was 111 years old.
I found her very little.
And how did I lose it? They didn't give us an idea to the bronk that that gave me, to have found them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women.
To honor those who went.
But above all, to not lose those who are there.
Thank you very much.
We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography.
The kids?
They keep losing a lot of time in school.
With ortography.
That's why I want to share with you a question.
Is there a new ortography missing?
I think so.
It's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have.
Neither the question nor the answer are new in our language.
They come by bouncing centuries for a long time.
From which in 1992, in the first grammar of the Castellan language.
Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle.
That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write.
Each sound should correspond to a lyrics.
Each letter should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound.
They had to eliminate themselves.
This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today.
That's it.
Because Spanish has different languages such as English or French.
I always had a strong resistance to write too different.
How do we pronounce?
But it's not.
Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing.
There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological.
The one who says we have to write.
According to how words were written in their original language, Latin, Greek, and that's how we stayed with walls we wrote, but we don't pronounce.
That's how we stayed with long and short waves, that, unlike what many people never believe, have never been differentiated in the pronouncement of the Spanish.
That's how we created Conges.
And sometimes they sound aspers, like in people.
And sometimes they sound soft, like fool.
That's how we stay with six, six, and seats.
There are three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but none to three.
I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience.
We all went to school.
We all invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and child brain.
Indicted.
In the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions.
They brought us in many implemented and explained ways.
The idea that in ortography something was fundamental was played.
From our training.
However, I have the feeling.
Until teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled?
What is ortography good for?
And the truth is that when you ask the answer, it's much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes.
orthography is useful.
To uniform writing.
so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it.
But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example.
In ortography there is no expressive, individual, involved abilities.
In punctuation, yes.
With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase, with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no.
With ortography, or is it good or bad?
According to Juste or not to the smart norms.
But then, wouldn't it be more senses to simplify the old norms?
To be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly.
Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the old norms?
So that all that time we dedicate him to teaching ortography.
We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort.
What I propose is not to abolish.
ortography is not that each one writes as they want.
The language is a common use tool.
Therefore, it seems fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
But it also seems fundamental to me.
Because those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done.
Especially.
Because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down.
When ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all.
I work every day with the literature of Ourolego, Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo.
Sometimes they write: "Men, signs," sometimes they write, "Let's write with a decoration."
And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time.
But not of quality.
But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story.
I mentioned that insistence a little reflected with the teachers knocking us and shocking us with ortography.
But the truth is that being things like you are, that makes sense.
In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content.
From what you're writing, you can get or stop getting a job for an H, that I put or stopped putting.
You can become a bubble object, a baby.
Malcolocated.
So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography.
But we shouldn't forget.
Throughout the history of our language, they were always teachers.
Or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters.
Those who pushed ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge.
In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had place in Spanish language, which was Chile's.
Middle Ages.
In the 19th century.
Why then?
How to take the bet of those teachers?
And start advancing in our ortography, me here, in the intimacy of us, 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing.
Let's eliminate the mood H.
There, where we wrote an H, but we didn't pronounce anything, we couldn't be any, we can discuss, sit down, each of us will have their preferences, each one will be able to argument, we don't have one, we eliminate the other: "Ge, jelga," we divide the sentimental appeals, we can justify for someone.
Garave, giraffe, people.
Argentine.
And I know, that, Iceta, it's an interesting case.
Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended; I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two, and from three letters, we go to two.
We are all better.
Some of these changes may seem a bit dramatic, they are not so much.
The Real Academy Spanish, all the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified.
That language is linked to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that attachment to history, traditions and customs are transformed into a obstacle.
It's for the use.
From today.
That explains that our language is much more.
That those we know that we have geographically close to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol.
And little by little, now they start to remove themselves exhausely some moved haches in the dictionary of the academy: harp, harmony, they can write with H or Sinache.
And we're all fine.
Does it look like me as well?
This is a moment.
Especially appropriated to face this discussion.
It always tells us that language changes spontaneously, below, up.
Because they are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications.
And that authority, in some places.
A academic, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry.
A lot of time later, they accept them and incorporate them.
This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the text level for words, it's less true.
For the grammatical level, and almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always changed from above, they were always the institutions that fixed the norms.
And they proposed modifications.
Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment?
Until today.
The writing has always had a much more restricted and private use it speaks.
But at our time.
The time of social networks.
This is suffering a revolutionary change.
It never was written as much as now.
They never wrote so much to the view of so many.
And in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school, novelous ortographic uses.
where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks.
It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is to say.
They relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication.
For now, there.
There are chaotic, individual uses.
But I think we have to pay attention.
Because probably they are telling us that a time that follows the writing, a new place, is asking for that writing new criteria, I think we would do badly to reject them.
To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinable norm with the needs of our times.
I can anticipate some objections.
Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, let's lose.
It's etymology.
In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography, but also from Latin, Greek, Arab.
With a simplified ortography, we're going to recover etymology at the same place we're going now, to the etymological dictionary.
A second observation of those who say.
If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguishing between these words that are different in only one letter, that's true.
But it's not a problem.
Our language has ormonies, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit the money, the suit that we put ourselves from the situations, the context dissipates any confusion.
But there's a third objection.
For me?
It's more comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one of those who say.
I don't want to change.
I educate myself like this.
I got used this way.
When I read a word written in simplified ortography, my eyes hurt.
(Laughter) That objection is within each one of us.
What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to?
And it turns out that time feels.
The new norms.
The success of all ortographic reform that touches so arraigated habits.
It's in the prudence the consensus, the fat-alism and tolerance.
But we can't let the rule, the old customs, prevent us from going forward.
The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve.
What we receive.
So I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography.
All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us.
I'm convinced that we do that.
In the modest environment, but importantly of language.
Let's be leaving them to the next generations, a future.
Better.
(Applause) Before my father died, I remember looking at him in the eyes.
I had the eyes of coffee with a joy around Liris.
And saying to myself, don't forget your eyes.
After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death.
Well, maybe for my training as a photographer.
Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope.
For the surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images, the discovery that made my view of the world transformed.
Well, the whole universe inside my mind.
(Laughter) It was like being floating in the universe.
It was like being that space.
A expansive space, without body.
It was absolute content.
It became peace.
This image.
Do you see it?
This is the image of the seeds of my microscope father.
(Audience talking) And it's another.
It's the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite.
All my fear and my sadness disappeared.
I didn't feel disconnection from anything or anyone.
Your death, more than a movie.
He represented the beginning where today is the project of my life.
Let's see a project.
For me, this is teaching.
That our most pure material essence.
We are scared by the cosmos.
And that when we look at the mirror.
There is perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe in.
And that matter is not created nor destroyed.
It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle.
Thank you.
(Applause) In Argentina.
The INBAP is a society of the state that develops atomic energy.
And space technology.
His satellites travel around the planet.
It's the best example, maybe we have.
The ability the state has to innovate.
We shouldn't create.
A battle of education.
Imagine a public agency.
That designs content and strategies to transform learning.
That I work with schools to rewrite what classrooms happen.
That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale.
A agency with pedagogists.
Designers, data scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you.
For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term.
They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture.
A mystic of innovation in public management.
The first step.
It's thinking about the state as a possibility.
Not like the variable of all the adjusts.
Just like that, changes in education.
They won't benefit the most advantages.
(Applause) I'm not a scientist, and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior.
And many times, on this path, cinema or literature.
They have been the only way to imagine how we would react in extraordinary situations.
From big loves, extraterrestrial invasions.
Until pandemic.
Until the fiction made reality.
And here and now, at home.
We don't stop asking questions.
From the most extraordinary corners of human condition.
Until the most ridiculous and the most worldwide.
For example, the world obsession would buy mountains of papers.
It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous.
Who is biological unconscious?
In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity of belonging.
It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive.
And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy.
It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us.
In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease.
But he had sequenced his genome and had done it pure.
And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology.
It's called optimistic dry.
The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we speak by phone or worse, while we send messages.
Thinking that, in fact, it won't happen to us.
It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity for the current time.
But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals.
Why does this happen now?
To us.
And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas.
For example, in the Ugonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States.
When, in reality, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease.
In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets, are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick with other people.
However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs.
This first makes people who are healthy or count and this is very important, but there's another most important reason: if they don't use masks, we get sick.
So this would be a sort of accusatory excuse.
Knowing who is sick and who doesn't use no more careers.
That they use it all over the world is a way to avoid self-esteem and with this.
We have to take care of everyone.
Who knows?
What we've discovered the most in these days.
It's our extraordinary ability to change.
In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do.
This is the case of the discovery now, where years we thought that education couldn't change and create those things that were extremely difficult to change.
And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home.
We don't know some consequences there.
But we learned that we are willing to do it if we need to learn.
And the world keeps going.
Also, of course, they change our values, our judgment.
It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started.
The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home.
Today, what seemed horrible then.
That everyone has to stay at home doesn't seem completely prior.
And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment?
It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future.
Imagine the next situation.
We're at the beginning of the apple.
A public consorcio that includes the Organization of Salud.
But also Government and other public sectors has the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move, who we find.
And also data of our body intimacy.
Our temperature, our respiratory frequency.
Maybe our face is viral.
And I can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who.
Let's suppose even more.
That this consensus can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way.
Those who are at home, those who are not at risk, can go out.
Imagine that with this we really keep the effect of the stone enormously.
It doesn't disappear completely, but it moves much less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it.
Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to give our data, the risk they were a misunderstanding of them is still true.
There's nothing free.
The question is: if you study the beginning of the pandemic?
And I could choose if it looks good or bad to do it.
What would you do?
I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is.
On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom.
They are fundamental values, pillar in our culture.
On the other hand, collective solutions that are necessary and the most efficient to solve flags.
Maybe we have our data a little like vaccinating us.
It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact.
To take care of us.
And everyone.
A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom.
We found a good solution of commitment.
Sex.
It's a reservative man.
When all this happens.
What will the balance we want to get to feel free?
And careful.
Are you going to fly less in a sky?
Will we change the way we greet?
Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone?
We don't know it, but locked at home.
Do we have an opportunity to think freely than ever?
What do we want, which is the conservative sex of the coronavirus?
(Applause) My first encounter with a fossil.
It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we made with my family the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina.
I had been many times in...
Museos, full of dinosaurs that fascinated me.
But this was the first time.
I saw a fossil in the field.
The middle of nowhere.
An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before.
The animal I found was similar to this, as we call it "dolars of Mars."
They are relatives from sea airplanes.
And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years.
Well, at that moment...
I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out.
And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know.
They are extremely fragile, the sea dollar broke down, the sand fell down.
And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way.
But...
I'm not interested in fossils or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past.
They kept captivating me.
And they took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago, in a remote past of our planet.
About 100 million years ago.
Our planet was very different as the one today.
It was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated.
For dinosaurs and other raptile groups.
And I told you 100 million years ago.
It's a number that we paleontologists do.
We mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize.
If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people.
Well, imagine each one of you.
It represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people.
10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a number.
That it doesn't enter the head.
And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all past years of life.
It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter.
In my head.
But well, the life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago, it's traveled.
Deserts and fossil studies from different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils.
It has also led me.
A very special place.
What is Patagonia?
And when we say "patagonia."
Naturally.
We think of one of these landscapes, of forests, of lakes, close to the crop of the Andes.
But for us, paleentologists.
Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils.
What do they want to be discovered?
We fortunately know many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world.
To look for dinosaurs, and the great majority of the dinosaurs we know about Patagonia is the last period.
In which dinosaurs lived on Earth?
What we call critical period.
This is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere.
The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios.
While for that time...
In the northern hemisphere, other carnivores gathered, like the dinosaurs, for example.
Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the north of the South wasn't.
Surprising because at that time, a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the North hemisphere.
But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before?
At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea.
And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the Kurassic, in the south hemisphere.
And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet.
His key hand, especially 170 million years ago.
When dinosaurs for the first time.
They dominated the planet completely.
For the first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores of omnivores in everything.
It planets.
We were dedicating this in the last 10 years.
With a group of colleagues, students and scholarships to explore the rocks of Patagonia's curasic.
And that leads me.
One of the stories of the discoveries we were able to do.
In the last years.
We found it four years ago, locked up like this, walking.
One afternoon, of a lot of heat.
After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp.
I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks, on the floor.
And I approached the idea that I was approaching.
It was becoming more clearly what it was.
It was the traffic of a dinosaur.
I approached, stood next to me, stood up.
I was really ice cream.
I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what was the track of a carnivor dinosaur.
But really?
I couldn't believe it.
I knew it was one of those discoveries that happened.
Very few times in life.
Leoa.
To warn the rest of the team.
And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of...
To protect this rest to be able to extract it.
After several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum.
And we started to take it low.
But the expedition was over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum.
Until the next time given that the winter came.
It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else.
Or there were more preserved rests.
After that long year, the first day.
From the stadium.
We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very radiant.
Very good.
In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions.
Clearly, the animal was dead.
A layer of a lake and she has already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way her sketch.
And that's when the scalp really begins: reading, straightening, cap, those sediments that were burning.
Where you open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time you're going back to the surface.
An animal?
That lived in that same place, but 170 million years ago.
Jennemal had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediment layers, that they were accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediments caps, and that food was transforming into sedentary rocks.
And in that same process, bones became fossil fuels for chemical reactions.
After all that package of dry rocks, he had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming.
From all this block.
And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning.
These layers, layer, until they start discovering.
These layers I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking from those hills.
Searching.
Those dinosaurs.
So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment and it's very exciting.
And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment.
It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun.
The Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry.
All this rest is protected by layers to the lab.
In the lab, the museum begins another extremely long stage, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big.
All the rocks that cover the bones.
These dinosaurs.
And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizaburus.
Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relative, a ancestor.
From the ships, those measures of the south hemisphere.
And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before.
What we thought.
(Laughter) A lot before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent.
Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there.
For example, of some rocks like these that we carry to the museum, knowing that there is fossil, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab.
We were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks.
A skeleton was quite complete and told with a very well preserved meat and with some very strange teeth.
Dents in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "man and Dance."
Now, this dinosaur is very particular.
For something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world.
What I have here is a replication of this dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
Very, very small, one of the smallest in the world, its complete skeleton wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end of the tail.
And this mining of dinosaurs didn't look like anything in the forms.
We found what we knew about the North hemisphere, studying their rest, we could see that their closest relatives.
They had been found in South Africa, in rocks of the same old age.
And this wasn't so surprising because if you see in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time of Pangea.
It's still not formed of the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents, but we had a case again.
In other words, restricted animals, only from the hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the northern hemisphere.
We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern.
And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived at this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time.
Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent.
And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century.
It was a great success what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere: it was the lack of water.
What I had isolated these aunts wasn't a desert full of water.
And when we think about dinosaurs?
And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really have fantastic organisms, fascinating.
They have challenged the limits of the body size in life's history.
They have diversified and conquered all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years.
But the most important thing is that.
It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet.
And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives.
Learn to read these stories.
Stories that are written in the rocks that formed for millions of years on our planet, attracting, each so much.
Animals and plants that lived in the past.
And while they were forming.
The Earth is a big book.
With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years.
And life.
It occupies a prepondering place.
In this story, in the last 3800 million years.
And there are millions of pages yet by reading this book.
And if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today.
It's fundamental to know your story.
Because knowing the past.
It's key to understand the present.
"Yes."
It's also key.
To design a future.
(Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid.
I wanted to have superpowers.
anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies.
I dreamed of competing.
To contain magical powers to build things.
I dreamed of defending small lands of terrible invasors.
Well, time is.
It gives us a quality bathroom.
It's through subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter.
Instead of invading small villages.
And you don't have the passion of panoramics to defend them.
But something about that child's vocation.
It stayed in me and almost without realizing it.
I dedicated myself to looking.
And trying to understand how these superpowers work.
They are not my imagination.
But in the real world.
Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop.
One of the main superpowers.
Maybe the most important thing in this situation.
To live.
What is the superpower of thinking better?
Obviously, there are many more superpowers.
And many more tools to think better.
But today I want to focus on which I think are less known.
I'm going to tell you about my ideas, I learned from others.
And this is, maybe?
The main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you.
That we are able to learn.
And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed.
But it can be developed.
Speaking of our mind with it.
powerful and practicing ideas.
So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better.
The first one: imagine they enter a gym.
Look.
That's on the floor.
Papers, neighbors, daughters.
Do you give me a round?
They go to the bar, they have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they get married.
It doesn't work like that, right?
Our body doesn't better recognize.
Well, compensating happens the same.
It doesn't count being able to think.
What counts is to think.
We have to practice thinking.
To develop ourselves is the habit.
We need to think and give time to think.
Intelligence is not something that has one.
It's something we use or we don't use.
The second one.
Do you see the saying?
Who only has a mattress?
They see all the problems as a key.
But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress.
Neither to realize their keyboard.
If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing.
And if we need to cut something, we need a bear.
Do you have a box of tools?
With more tools it allows us to do more things, to solve more problems.
And tools are usually called mental models.
If we only have a mental model?
Let's think about all the problems with that model.
As if they tried to get a t-shirt with a noise.
If we have many mental models.
Our mind is much more powerful.
But where do these mental models find?
Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times.
For example, there are mental models.
Interesting in physics, biology, engineering, psychology.
And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina.
In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ.
In the Middle Ages and in our time.
To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads.
It's no.
All the problems will seem uncled.
It's the third.
Little by little I was in the club and at the side table.
A man told his friends.
He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher.
Go ahead of his son and his classmates.
Or a mistake that the teacher had committed.
The man was right in everything he told his friends, and he told him something.
That's it.
But he didn't realize it.
What about it?
In other words, this.
I was creating a much greater evil.
In Switzerland.
I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends.
And I was unpleasant to the teacher.
In front of all the children who had to learn from them.
Many times we don't realize it.
To be focused on earning a scale.
You don't know how to have success in that scale.
And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in our most important scale.
To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example.
It's a money and a freedom.
Or with freedom and losing love.
When we act, we think: What is the impact we are going to do?
And what is the most important scale?
In which we have to think how to act.
The fourth one.
The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes.
It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression.
And the impression is to have emotions.
And emotions make us act.
For example, in the pandemic.
We arrived many Chinese situations.
But those acts didn't have impressions.
They generated emotions.
And that's not how we act.
When they started to get there.
Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China.
These implications are generated in emotion.
Fear.
And the fear of generating action.
We are all now watched, preventively, what is moving.
We were lucky that fear gave us time.
Because someone appeared before we do.
But many times.
It's important to act when we still don't see and feel.
The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric.
To get married is something.
Do you have hunger?
Did you get married?
You have an immediate reward.
"You eat what you got married."
But cultivating is very different.
Do you make the effort now?
It's something that will take place for six months or a half.
This is the pillar of almost everything we have.
But let's earn to generate applause.
Because it's avoiding something.
That nobody is a benicient.
But I leave lives.
We develop our ability to act before feeling.
That is to say, we develop our ability to anticipate.
It's one of the main abilities to think well.
Let's think a minute.
What do we have to anticipate?
Now.
That's all day long.
We feel, we live.
In the fifth?
We all evaluate things according to our expectations.
If something bad lasts three months and we think we would last six months.
We are happy.
If something bad, it lasts three months and we think it would last.
The month is sad.
It's the same time, it's three months.
But we live them completely different.
If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example.
In kilometers, we are exhausted.
If we program to run 20.
Nine kilometers are unbearable.
We make a culte of resilience.
But the key of resilience is to handle the expectations well.
The sixth and last one.
Have you ever met a well-known place?
You're walking through a village in the middle of the ship.
A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago.
When you can create an unlikely chance to find something in that place.
What truth is, finding that classmate, in that place, is something totally improbable.
But as we know so many people.
It's very likely.
To find someone in a very improbable place.
In fact, it happens all the time.
Well, with the rest of the life is the same.
There are so many unlikely things.
It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us.
The problem is that our mind.
It makes us think that the improbable is impossible.
And it's not.
It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future.
We don't know what will happen.
Nevertheless, my field with more formal times.
We have to learn to live with uncertainty.
And it was better the intelligent way to live with uncertainty.
To always leave many open doors.
Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it's possible.
Of serious things, even if they are very likely.
And if someone ever asks you?
Why do you always have cars with the tank of "hash full"?
Specifically.
Why once?
You found yourself in a town on the other side of the world.
With a secondary classmate that I didn't see that sequence.
I said at the beginning that I wanted to do with this talk.
Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn.
And learning has to do with being accepted.
To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking.
And people.
With which we cultivate these ideas.
We are surrounded by people who enrich our way of thinking.
It's not about convincing others.
It's about changing our own ideas.
A 40-year-old interview.
Entrevistator is a question.
And when Borges replied.
The interviewed told me, "This same thing happened to me."
That same question four years ago.
"Moro did, do you want a box?"
He looked at him.
And he said.
I ask for excuses.
It hasn't had much time to think about this subject for these four years.
Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live.
To be accepted by new ideas.
The new cities are emerging.
And they were always open.
To change our way of thinking.
Thank you.
Women are irrational beings.
Always given to the emotional disorder.
That's why they need the custodian of a men.
which is the rational of the family.
At the beginning of their lives?
They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of it.
This phrase was in the introduction.
It was a manual for the education of girls and young girls about marriage.
Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930.
But the idea, yes.
It has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times.
In 1915, no country in the world could vote.
In 2015, that is, there are hundreds of years later, 65 countries are governed by women.
In 1910.
(Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize.
(Laughter) But the French science Academy said that he didn't have enough merit to be academic, and the first woman in France who entered science was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of those who are here had already finished the primary.
The university, leaving, has a very prestigious business school.
That in 1925, until now 50 years ago it's celebrating that, left a woman to be a master's degree.
Hale University admired women in 1972.
The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow.
This was.
This idea.
That women only serve to create children.
"Yes."
It helps the husband.
It's a rational series.
What a cistery!
It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment.
And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they believed this idea.
It was a true fact.
Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed?
Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm.
Politics we've lived in the economic system are nothing on the side of this, we're leaving the side, the idea that truth is true.
The idea that truth is a lie.
There are not facts, they only exist interpretations.
Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language.
In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world.
2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem.
Now neurobiologists.
And cognitive psychologists are studying this.
We can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world.
Not the objective world.
There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world is.
That there is outside, we will be able to understand it.
When you say that there is no facts, that there are interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium.
That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, they are the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark.
What is an interpretative mark?
What day is it today?
24th of September.
Does anyone doubt it?
What day is it for you?
Let's make the 24th September, because all of us here agree with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist.
On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, the cats live without calendar.
My dog applies to the chest, and who is very lonely at home.
No, making some misfortune.
I didn't know the time, I knew what I was going back.
It doesn't look at the clock.
If human beings didn't have it.
These conceptual boats would have a relationship with the world.
That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense.
All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree.
He looked at a blanket.
He wrote the gravity law, "What a genius!"
But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time.
If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, I would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution.
Would you miss the trips I did, know the animals I saw?
Everything that had accumulated in the British museum, fossils, etc.
Besides...
"Yeah!
To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, there was no print.
It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea.
The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea.
But the time is what it generates.
The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born.
But it was born in the 19th century.
The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same thing happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing happens with what we are thinking about now, and the same political and social change is revolutionary.
How did we see it?
For thousands of years women were.
Those who took care of the house and raised the children.
And yet.
In less than 100 years they went to govern countries, half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost in humanity to think more than to clean panels.
How much was humanity lost, how many remedies, how much intelligence?
How much creativity?
In other words, errones are monsters.
There's an idea we can do it.
To follow because it was created a century and a half ago, and that example, to study this process.
What is the creation of homosexuality?
Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world.
You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, there were always, in every culture, at all times.
They are even documented in many animals outside of humans.
But I had never thought about it.
"What?"
The sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally created, sexual identity.
It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A.
Victorian moral, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak.
The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex, when they prohibit us something we want to do, don't have turbies.
(Laughter) You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you fault, it's not true, it's a great social control... (Applause) You don't give the woman of your fellow man.
(Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man, right?
It will give you guilt, it will give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it, and then that's a form of terrible social control because it dominates us, probably, on the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they were given us to eat.
We can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat.
Audience: Yes.
Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, a waste bathroom where everything that was wrong is the society of the sexual point of view and put it there.
The homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, my right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks, who were sensitive from slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves.
It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, none of the situations today is ideal.
We all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century.
It's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, this is just about to get up now, and many parts of the world are still condemned to be fusilated.
But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all depressed, take their identity, respect and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full right.
To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish.
(Laughter) To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, as a black man, only black, and the same thing is gay.
And if you win the women, the Jews, the blacks, the big ones, we are all complete, complex people, contradictories, that maybe I don't have the desire to like that, but, however, we have to take that.
Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison.
Of the jails.
50 years ago?
They have to live alone.
I was a homosexual child.
(Laughter) I didn't look at myself, and I didn't know what it was, I caused rejection, which was something I had in me, that my father, who loved me, looked at me, I didn't know what a homosexual child was, and I didn't know the homosexual word.
And it made me feel.
What would I have done so that it come out like that?
What was it like that?
I had to learn what to be like that, I had to learn to be homosexual.
I had to turn less homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual.
To assume the identity there is.
I had a positive side.
I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not to reject me.
I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot.
But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours.
I stopped being a person.
And I'm a person, like any other person in the world.
I'm contradictory, I'm complete, I'm complex.
It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince the others that homosexuals are people and we are human beings.
And it took me 50 years to learn.
That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity.
20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had.
It arises to understand that there are no facts that exist.
(Laughter) (Applause) There are the contradictions and I'm going to say, because really that, we are contradictory, the facts exist in interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend me, and now I want to go, I said, and when I fit it, because when I don't move it, while we only have the head doesn't serve it.
Do you give her body?
I left prison.
And I left my prison, it was so wonderful.
Do you think it's expensive?
I'm not there or they told me that there's a list of things we need to survive, called the basis.
What an idea of living constantly with this canasta, Mexico, San Pedro, our community?
It contains the things we need to survive, and if better you go to the things we need.
How can we explore?
But exploring is something difficult, the constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, to adapt, it's a moment.
Of course or small: full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know disappears.
And when everything you do is paid for someone else's voices, you don't even have a microphone.
What do you duplicate the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstaclesize?
But once you say it, once you achieve your words, you get a avalanche of ideas that come towards you all speed.
Each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate.
But some of these ideas are rain, and you have to choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side and in part with each one of them.
Each moment is a combination of energy, of following, of getting up, rooting or running.
But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated: learning to harm your own movement.
A class isn't called.
With a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment.
And even if life controls music, movements, I believe them.
Movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing.
Moments.
That they keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be a work of art.
But they will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw.
The formula you saw on the face when you spoke about what you loved the most, the speed I took to your heart.
Or how do you start talking to you?
That voice, that voice that you so much know, that you probably are looking for something you lose.
That voice.
"Your best friend."
It's not enough and always.
It will be the first to defend yourself, the first to walk in a little kitchen to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first is in that orilla, in that orialist to jump for you when you need it.
That person is your best friend.
A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better environment.
Without that, without that, I can't survive.
What we created in girls' cities.
I'm sure that we chose it.
(Laughter) I don't have the chance to leave here.
Very well, it's to be a little unbearable.
I can't progress in the way I would like to change.
(Laughter) There, a person always appears for what they were already in years.
It's strange and with a bread, you remember your experience, if you don't get an idea.
(Laughter) Do you remember that all the time spent was better?
Is this really the case?
Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us.
To think about this.
Unfortunately, I remember my friends of all life, Juancho, Franco and Manuel.
These photos that are seeing there.
It's 2009 when I saw the secondary school.
What can I tell you about my friends?
I really want them to be like my brothers.
And that they are three super-capable people.
That, as I didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like in order to study what I liked.
They stayed here in the city.
And go to surprise, to the day of today, you can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams.
While I want to be in this photo.
The brand of opportunities is also made present.
My parents, who are workers, made an effort about humans to whom I could study what I liked.
Because I knew that I didn't know if I stayed here in the city.
I could study the other, but probably the future as a person and quite short opportunities.
Have you ever wondered why these things happen?
Children in the middle of the 21st century.
We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization.
(Laughter) In which successes and advances are due to a speed that surprise us all.
And above the borders and the barriers that insist between people.
AD: And in this context?
The cities to accept more and more important.
Let's be honest, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence.
It is estimated that in 2050.
68% of the world's population will live in a city.
Because if that number doesn't sound to you.
I'd have to be almost 10 people in the whole world.
Seven decades.
If more people choose to live in cities.
And it's called where we have the greatest chance to cry.
Thank you.
It's what they explain, then, that while the closet cities appear in time, others progress, they are vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them.
I'm going to tell you a key word that you want you to go to the cow when you get out of that door to return home.
This is strategy.
If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world.
Besides my concern as a professional future in the field of international relationships, it happens precisely for this.
To connect cities with opportunities that the world has to offer.
Not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities.
And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics.
Now you'll tell me, "How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?"
Through complete projects.
That improves the quality of life of the population.
They avoid immigration.
Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends.
This is a picture a few months ago, and that's how LEvita can be noticed a couple of things, to replace a fifth friend, friend Fiera, the group.
Do you know what it is?
The girlfriend of drugs.
Secondly, we can also say that it is given a kind of universal relationship in proportional.
The media that will decorate the quality of the photos of the phones.
What we were in it, we were improving, some have a couple of kilos.
And we have to be ugly, but...
Do you know what we share until today?
It's beyond the deep steps we have of some with us.
The brand of the lack of opportunities.
For example, the one that is also made in this picture.
It was the national champion of the solidarity of geography in 2002.
A national champion.
But today, although it's left to destroy a school teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be some students working to be able to live.
It's the one that's left below, that I like to go to the subway.
I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the strength of security in the country.
(Laughter) As I didn't count with that possibility here, I started changing my career without finding what was really passionate about.
And I can't get a job that allows seven economical dependencies.
The last one is Manuel, who is a genius of illustration, but they don't know the geniuses, they give them anything.
Do you realize it?
Every day we worked in their local that built from nothing itself.
Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs.
The worst of all this I'm telling you.
That's it!
We, as young people, don't have it.
Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing.
According to English, I had the huge fortune to leave the election between a group of 8 young leaders at a worldwide level.
To participate in a weekend, in New Day, the capital of India.
I traveled to Argentina's presentation, I was the only Argentinian in that event.
Audience: Yes.
Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back.
I learned a lot.
But if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following.
There are millions that I will never be able to say it with enough bottles so that you can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities outside.
But there are discourse found, they don't come alone.
Our human resources, as Argentines, are brilliant.
I don't have any desire to read the youths, nor to the kids, nor to anyone.
Do you know what the differences we don't have?
What do you have?
And there's a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them.
Once again.
If we want better cities, we know strategically the world.
Remember?
When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, that I could stop studying.
With three days to fulfill 18 years.
I was very scared, with a lot of fear.
This can never be found in public.
Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen.
It's very difficult for your city.
That's all.
It's like leaving a piece of your heart.
Until today I feel this way, almost six years went by.
What is this?
I don't have to go to my pocket.
Who are the friends?
And nobody you know?
It's necessary to give tools to our young people so they stay in their cities and grow from there.
"Oh, that's cool!
What a beautiful thing!
To give you wings to the city you had to do.
And with a strategy we can do it.
Imagine the brilliant who would have been white.
If I could dedicate myself completely to geography.
Or for us to be so far away, that's more noble.
If I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I had.
Is it like that?
Thank you.
That's how it works.
You see the lack of opportunities.
"Yes."
All of this.
And I'm telling you.
It doesn't look like enough arguments.
Do you want a more example?
I'm fine.
This one.
It's the tattoo.
And he says to me, "When I run?"
I was able to overcome the profound 20th depression.
In which I fell, I'll have my city's country.
Two requests of suicide.
In numeral, psychological sequels.
He told me.
A lot, a lot of surgery.
If we want these things to stop passing?
We have to go out strategically.
We don't add a final point to our cities.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) I'm a surgeon.
Since always, surgeons.
We think that to have more work.
We have to look for it.
More reasons to operate more patients.
In my last 10 years?
My research.
In my case, in the zoo.
It went on.
To look for the reasons.
To operate.
Every time less to patients.
This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes.
To detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them.
We can help tissues to repair.
For themselves.
using their own ability to regenerate.
That's it.
We do it.
With biological platforms.
What are they?
Like maps.
What do we read?
To the tissue.
To use their own capacity.
Restaurate after a damage.
And finally, with new technologies.
We can, for example, with an endoscope.
To make procedures.
And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out.
Robotics are giving us a lot of tools.
To facilitate these tasks.
What is before?
It seemed science fiction.
Today it's almost daily, it's hallucinating.
To challenge.
My own paradigms of...
To have more and more patients to operate.
It gave me many satisfactions.
What about me?
And a lot of patients.
What did they avoid?
We have to make a surgery.
With all this I told you.
I realized it.
That developing methods, increasingly invasive.
What do I have?
Every time?
More work.
I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic.
Thank you.
I'm not a doctor.
My mother is Japanese, and I think that certain behaviors and answers, social and individual societies, can help us when facing a crisis like this one.
It's worth asking us a first question.
Why Japan?
I was able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage.
If in January the first case came out.
I'm so close to the neighbour.
Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space.
I'm talking about the third age populations.
Most of the world.
(Applause)
Being in the second country with more fumers for many inhabitants.
Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth?
but a linear advance.
And the identified.
Until now.
We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious.
In these demographic status, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease.
Basically.
Many people, in little place.
And a room of that people with more than 65.
What happens then?
Japanese is a society.
Educed in such a way that responds in an organic and humid way.
Even any event that compromises it.
Japan went through wars, Tifones, his name.
Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year.
1,000 temblors per day.
Generation, transgeneration has had to overcome catastrophes.
Nature co-generated by man.
We can think about this.
With something that likes the Argentines a lot: football teams.
Like an example.
What kind of soccer will it have better performance before a critical moment?
The team that trains every day.
Each one knows what to do in which it has infrastructure.
Or the team that never entered.
It doesn't have infrastructure.
And it has to come out to improvise.
The directives of social distancing.
And that's it, right?
And individual behavior.
Whether it's in society or at home.
The Japanese population hasn't established you for hundreds of years.
It doesn't need to say, it doesn't embrace.
Not to give beers.
Because they don't do it.
It greets with a reverence.
In other words, giving distance is a gesture of respect.
And most of the workers in public places use a lot.
It's not necessary to recommend to get out of shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used.
(Laughter) We don't have to indicate, we don't have to turn our third on another person.
Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese.
In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected.
Not to protect yourself, but to protect others.
Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture.
In other words, the good of everything.
It's more important to sell a part.
To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan.
I will surely know the game of the chairs.
You put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and you get out of one.
In each round.
And he did this experience in Japan.
And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all.
Seeing the place to a classmate.
Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers.
The word " japonesa" loves.
It expresses this way of being.
It's about having confidence that the other will take care of me in resonance with feeling that we realize when we take care of others.
In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works.
(Laughter) Do you help yourself?
Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone.
