(Applause)
(Applause) (Music) In the middle of the wind, the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
In other words, I'm a philosopher at the end of the Chinese atmosphere.
There's a tool for land tracks, lejanas, and music, orchestra.
The Chinese?
The one who inhabits the backyard, we had a vision, the violin and the instrument we had, the protagonist.
In our popular music, for this we change the way we touch it.
In this way it sounds folklore and it can be danced.
Ladies and gentlemen, live in Europe.
Mauro lives in Buenos Aires.
And the beginning that we had to learn to work in detail is called for video, each one records its part.
So the other can play on top and that's how we're going to save the report.
Let's connect my title.
That's it.
In the wind, the air in the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
Invisible, the air in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, in the wind.
(Applause)
(Applause) (Cheers)
(Applause) Of course, I don't even know what suffered me.
It's the second statement.
So I get sick.
And the relatives of those who haven't recovered.
What are you seeing?
The show, right?
Let me ask you to see Station.
(Audience) Yes!
But there's something new in this pandemic.
Something that...
We dedicate ourselves to checking the contents of social networks and fighting for that information.
We were already seeing and worried about this new era.
During the pandemic of the flu.
In 2009, there was already Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but its consumption, global super-traction.
Let's go back to my tone.
The pandemic, in the 19th century, is the first pandemic that coexists with infodebia.
"What do you do, what information did you do?"
The OMS, the World Health Organization, defined it as a practice of spreading false and wonderful news about pandemic.
(Laughter) And he called it "Tarla."
Because it generates panic and anxiety of people.
The misinformation is always dangerous.
When we know, but when health issues are referred, it's much more dangerous.
Because what can affect, what can put in danger is directly our life.
(Sigh) I didn't know anything about an idea.
From the amount of waste.
That these days circulate in Facebook, Instagram.
And you, Twitter, and for that reason, WhatsApp.
Or maybe it's a idea, because they belong to a virus.
Nadian suffers the localization of unbearable contents.
(Audience) Yes.
(Laughter) For four weeks, with my team.
(Audience) Oh!
We work.
Without rest.
"Shut up!"
With false content.
A winner.
Do you really see those media?
That circulate on this new disease.
They know what we know.
And we are aware that we can't stop this avalanche of information.
It's impossible.
And sometimes they are frustrated.
(End of video) That's why I think it's subtle that tells you something we discover, something we find.
All the contents.
Pictured at COVID-19.
They can fit.
Or classifying in four categories.
I believe that by telling you, you will be more prepared.
And being more prepared, maybe they can help us stop this avalanche of information that come to us above: The four categories are simple, the first one has to do with that.
With content linked to the origin of the disease.
Cities that say that a act of pioneer of two Chinese scientists stealed them in Canada until a English lab created this virus in 2014.
None of this is true, if they have been contained, linked to a theory that human beings create this virus.
Don't take it seriously, download no, there's no evidence of that.
The second category is related to how the virus spreads and expands.
A law located in a scientific study in a paper that provokes living a few hours in the air, made millions of people repeat and some media that we were not going to contagiate with only opening the window, that's not like that, there's no evidence of that.
The third category is the one related to false.
Sure treatments are the most dangerous, it's the one that has to put more attentive.
Those who have to make us more careful.
Isn't it true that taking hot water with lemon we kill glasses and making garbage with warm water or making vapor the virus to disappear from our body if we are infected?
It's not true that there's already the vaccine that will enhance us.
There is no Cuban sweat.
That he managed to generate it and there is no Argentine who has already discovered the wild vaccine.
Science works all the machine to find treatment and adequate medications, but at the moment it doesn't have a completely satisfied answer.
The fourth category of information is related to false measures, it circulated a false decrease that said that the quarantine started at 3 pm of that day, without the farther in Argentina, the day it was disappointed, the obligatory isolation, 15 days ago, with a little more, or by the authorities.
And obviously it generated a lot of chaos.
There are also content that make compares between countries to prevent it will happen, but they do it without context.
Or others, with those who perhaps cross you, who say that it's going to be on the Internet, not only in Argentina, but in the whole world.
And that's how it makes us fear that we are not only going so much to be locked in our homes, but communicated.
The misinformation is in general.
They try to generate panic.
That's why it's important that some of these contents receive that enter some of these four boxes and don't come from an official source, like the World Health Organization or the health Ministry distress.
Before finishing...
I want to tell you something else we learned, those we dedicate ourselves to checking, checking.
(Laughter)
We are not good.
With doubt.
We are not comfortable.
When the certainty is missing.
(Audience) Yes!
And then we move forward, we move forward to look for that certainty.
Without the care we should have.
I want to ask you a favor.
If you receive a content, it's not checking.
Don't share it.
Let's replace sharing for doubts.
It's so usual.
Ah!
I don't share doubts.
That's what we take care of.
(End of video) If I received a content.
From someone.
And don't take care of what they do.
Putting coches.
How did I turn it off?
Confirming salt and affection.
And if you share a content and then realize that it's false.
To have boxes.
Disculpate and correct.
That's not about tons, but of living.
Science works intensely to get the cure, the dynamic pandemic tells us affectologists, sanitarists, employees all the time, there are changes every day.
But there is no time.
While there are empty evidence and information.
We have to be able, maybe as a singer, to tolerate that uncertainty.
I remember another moment in the modern era.
In which the answers are missing.
And the certainties we needed as much as now.
But I'm sure that if we fill those passengers with blue content.
Because we are not able to tolerate our ignorance, we will be much worse than if we tolerate them.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
23 years ago.
What I dedicate myself to accompanying people in the last moments of their lives.
And in these years I learned many things.
Some of which I would like to share with you today.
I learned to work in the middle of pain of other people.
It doesn't make you a person or bitter, nor sad.
All the opposite.
It teaches you to appreciate every moment of your existence.
And to be grateful for everything you have.
I learned that miracles exist, but maybe in a different way, as we wanted them to be.
If not being able to see a miracle in an act of reconciliation.
Sorry.
Of love.
Or transformation.
I learned that the sense of humor is a very powerful tool.
That allows you to make a parenthesis.
In the middle of loneliness.
insecurity and fear.
That they generate the close presence of death.
I learned that doctors have to work much more.
Our omnipotenty is to be more humble.
And not to feel frustrated or failed.
When despite having done everything possible?
The result is not the one we expected.
I learned that when we are going through difficult times ...
It's good to look.
And there are many people.
They are suffering.
And in conditions much more attractive than ours.
And that allows you to put your own perspective problem.
Finally, I learned and still learn.
That it's not just about cure.
Especially, is it about aligning?
And to accompany.
To grow, love and compassion help to face suffering.
And they can be a legacy for the family.
To grow, love and compassion.
They can leave a path of trascendence so that others can transit.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause) Good evening.
So little...
I've spent 40 years.
After writing several novels.
I wanted to write about more personal issues.
I took my pluma and after several pages.
I realized that I was going to be inevitable to talk about my female condition, of my condition of women.
Why do you introduce a man?
Is it enough for him to say?
Good evening, you're a gentleman, you're a writer.
For a woman like me?
Do I have to decide good evening, I'm a writer?
And I'm a woman.
Why should we have to introduce ourselves like this?
KA: I had a lot to start my research on feminine condition.
It was a very written topic in many articles.
It's losing feminity, feminity will disappear.
The topic becomes fast, especially for women.
But in the end, what is feminity?
We can remember approximately that half of humanity is men and the other half are women.
Half of humanity.
And it's masculinity, there's another friend.
Is feminity?
So why do we ask ourselves to be more women?
Is there a mold to be a woman?
At 30 years old.
Have you told me that I was going to write a book about female condition?
I would have surprised me, maybe angry.
At 40.
I'm really enjoying it.
It's such an obvious topic.
But at the same time, they are ignored.
And I'm interested in understanding why a woman lives their dreams, their disappointments, their frustrations, different to a man.
It's enough to go without the street, to see that humanity is divided in two groups.
What a different way?
That they are seen differently.
And that they speak differently.
I started my research recording all the beliefs about feminity, the myths that exist.
about women in our society.
But I knew that my job wouldn't be complete.
If it wasn't going to look for the causes of these myths.
Studying more biological, physiological.
Psychologists?
Technological?
I hadn't happened to any man to analyze the peculiar condition of man in society.
The singularity of man.
It's that it doesn't have a case, the shadow is everything in the majority of the languages, the man is both the positive and the neutral side, the man is humanity.
The man is the whole, the main one is the essential.
Women?
It's the other, the other.
Women.
The second sex.
The second sex.
Women are not essential.
It wasn't defined by itself.
They define reciprocity to man.
That it's all.
So I followed my research.
And I realized that in the history of civilization, many times they create excluded groups.
Would you be excluded as blacks?
Excluded as the properties, or the Jews.
But among them there is a community.
They tell us, "We identify ourselves."
However, women.
I don't identify so easily among them.
They don't say us.
In fact.
A white woman will be more easily identified with a white man?
Because with a black woman.
A bubble woman.
Would you identify yourself easily with a shadow name?
That with a prosecutor.
Women don't create community.
Women don't say us.
Because they live disperse inside the group of men.
Don't forget it.
At the chest?
It's quite satisfied to believe and feel the king of creation.
Until the anti-feminists.
Did you see?
Theories in religion, in theory, in biology.
To explain the inferiority of women.
In philosophical discussions.
Several men usually interpel me to tell me.
Do you think it's a woman?
Of course?
As if by having ovaries and a uterus and the rule and hormones will take me any objectivity.
But how did they write in their stories?
Theories.
They didn't have their hormones and their therone texts showing them to think.
So, what do I want?
So, it's to raise awareness about these differences and understand them.
To share what I understood.
(Laughter)
I shared what I understood because women behave different from men.
(Audience) Yes!
And within everything I told you, that I studied biology and physiology, etc.
I realized something.
That women's behavior has not been erased by their nature.
It's not for culture.
(Audience) Yes.
Natura went like this.
It doesn't spread all society, it's culture.
What explains how we are interacting in our society?
In other terms.
It's not born a woman.
It's about doing it.
I was quite privileged.
When I published my first novel, I was immediately recognized as a writer.
And at the same time it was recognized as a woman.
Therefore, I didn't suffer my feminity.
I had the best in the world: an integral individual.
It's integral.
Many women stay in their feminity because man explains it's very natural for her.
To get married?
Returning is the slave of possessions?
To have children is dedicated to creating them.
Men explain that it's very natural to all that.
Therefore...
His feminity is summarized to that.
I don't want to change the female condition.
For that, it's a lot.
What I do want to do.
Is it as a scientist?
To be aware of these differences.
And to be aware that we can make decisions.
With the pre-volontate.
What I want to share.
It's that each woman.
And each man.
It can and must decide what they want for their sexuality.
Especially what they dream of doing their family.
Each woman, every man.
It has to define what it wants to do in work.
If you want or not to work?
With free choice, free will.
What I want is to be aware of.
What is this effort?
It has to be done together.
Between men.
And women.
What I want is consciousness.
That's when the second is sex.
I will have answered these questions.
And they are living them.
So ...
Let's live in a society.
Complete.
The power is.
made of men and women completely complete and free.
Thank you.
Thank you (Applause) (Music)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause) Good afternoon, I guess you'll have studied for today, you surely know the path that is a hymno in search of freedom, or a hymno that talks about thoughts that are going like the golden waves on mountains and hills.
And in the end, he says, "And these thoughts so they can give it."
The suffering, the value.
It's something that wrote it "Verdi" and "Open Hambuco" more than 100 years ago, and we can take it as own.
So all ready, also, right?
Now breathe, surely they've been breathing at home, but now...
(Laughter) Now we're going to breathe specifically to sing this, let's go with the court?
(Applause) (Music) (Music) (Audience talking) "Yeah, that's great." (Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
A couple of years ago.
A group of friends in my school was going to go out to mark for the legalization of the abortion.
I asked my most and I could with them.
And my mom told me no, that in any way it was very young to be alone, that I was afraid of what could happen.
And then I told him, "It's OK."
If I didn't have the desire to go with them, and my mom, who didn't steal a mark from the time of the workshop, would accompany me.
I came with me to Congress.
I still remember his face when we arrived.
Look around you.
And he told me with a smile and a lot of surprise.
Wow!
It's full of kids.
(Audience) Yes!
Actually, we were almost all girls.
But well, the thing equals understand each other, right?
This, for my mom, was so surprising and unexpected, is something that today is super natural to me.
Talking about politics, saying what I think, leaving walking through what I think is fair.
These are things I do a lot.
I think it has to do with that I grew up with a almost strict diet of books and movies about teenagers that changed the world.
Harry Potter, the games of hunger, divergent, generous cronics.
What are the stories of my generation?
In all of them.
There are villains that oppress.
That they described the rest that they say to be more.
And in all, there are teenagers.
Children like me.
That they get up and fight to build something more open and free.
(Audience) Yes!
It doesn't surprise me at all, so the attitude I see many teenagers is respect to politics.
Even sometimes it seems that another option doesn't leave us.
Because they didn't educate themselves thinking that when you are living in a distopy.
Because it's a dark and indeciable world like the one of those books.
We have to fight to change that.
And then they put us heads in a closing distopy like climate change.
Where we are the youths who are going to pay the account.
Sometimes I look around and I feel we are living in one of those books.
But where there are one of those distopies, they also have to be those protagonists who reveal themselves, right?
In any place where a death flight is made.
It has to do with Harry.
And, of course, also in a Jerma Yoni (Applause)
For me, politics isn't something abstract, that exists beyond our daily life.
On the contrary, I think it's present in all the areas of our lives, in the culture we consume, in the stories we tell, in the versions we choose to believe in what we think is good or bad.
Even the bonds for me have a political dimension.
It happens to me that sometimes my friends or my relatives criticize me to call the attention to the people who make xenophobos comments.
Or by discussing about political things, and while many people prefer to avoid these topics, to not generate fight, their uncomfortable situations.
I know there are certain things that are worth fighting for.
And that discussing with someone for their political position ...
It's not the same as fighting because I'm a mouth and a River's voice, that, in the end of the day, although sometimes it doesn't appear, it's a totally artificial difference and without importance.
What we think politically makes us as people.
That's why if a family member does a sexist comment.
I'm going to discuss it.
If I have a friend who is against egalitarian marriage or abortion legalization?
I don't avoid the subject to keep peace.
I talk to this person, I listen to her opinion, and I tell her without embarrassment.
And when we talk about a close relationship with someone.
Who are these things good?
Because it can't give me the same way he or she thinks about the other and how it deserves to be treated.
Because that opinion is saying something about how that person sees me.
When many say better to get married.
I say, "Let's talk."
Although it's uncomfortable, even if it paralyzes us, even if it gives us a lot of fear, because only talking can be built our future.
And to rethink our present.
I wish, we begin to see the marks and political spaces in general, not as something dangerous, something scared.
But as a space of personal and social growth.
of union and inspiration, and I hope there's always, but there's always a place for teenagers.
And that you can look at yourself with pride.
And to say without any surprise.
It's full of kids.
(Applause) Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
Can you imagine having to walk for hours every day, charging a ball like this?
To take water to your house?
(Audience): Yes!
(Audience) Yes!
(Audience): Yes.
Can you imagine the water that was inside?
Was it like that polluted, had this color?
(Laughter) Water crisis is a fact.
It's a reality in which we can't close our eyes and in which we'll all have to face ourselves in the future.
So they signed the majority of countries, members of the UN, who attended the day by global action, climate by water, a couple of days in Morocco.
Life water, and without it we wouldn't exist, in fact, human beings, we are composed of more than 65% of water.
And despite that, each day we contaminate our waters, our rivers, manantial lakes.
Through agriculture...
From the livestock of our great companies and even of our own daily activities, even if we don't realize it.
This is not just the result in the appearance of diseases around the world.
But what is the direct cause of death of a thousand children a day?
1,000 children a day.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 740 million people live without access to drinking water in the world.
This means that if we choose ten people randomly from any part of the Earth, at least two will have serious problems to have access to water.
That's it.
From that number of people, at least 60 million, are found in Latin America, and if we think about it, it turns out in some paradoxical way.
Because this continent counts with 35 percent of the water reserves in the whole world.
And if we look at some cases in particular?
We'll realize, going to the country, that, for example, Peru, sorry, has at least 30% of the population without access to drinking water.
And that if we climb a little higher to Mexico, border with the United States of America, where, by the way, the gentleman Trump wants to build a wall, which is even more to these two countries, now wants to build a wall.
Almost 20 million people, that is, around 20% of the country's population lives without clean water every day.
(Laughter) All these numbers, those looking back, made us wonder: How is it possible that a continent with natural wealth is found in this situation?
And we wanted bags, and we got back again to take drinking water, it's exactly this question that made four doctors from Zarabota, we left it all, thousands of people in Latin America, from Mexico to Peru.
Returning like this?
And the fourth step is sex.
Let's stop.
From a caravan autocaravan shelter so that we call the white fair and, above all, organicisms of a tremendous branches, to return to the group.
Luckily, we did have been born.
We pull it to the adventure.
During the way, we managed to find rural and captured communities.
Trying to see, they have water at home.
All of them were able to laugh, bones or marantials.
To be able to see.
But always...
With a common problem.
(Laughter) The water has this pen, it's contaminated.
All these communities usually have three days to purify the cat.
Listening it or directly buying it.
So, as you can see, it suggests a huge waste for people who don't have age practically.
Thouses of money to buy these bidons or time resources to go look for the leg and then go to the hospital.
And we asked ourselves.
What can we do to help solve this problem?
By having the base that we were none experts in matter, we put our hands to the work.
And after many weeks of research, we found a system.
Findraction by Membrales that was perfectly adapted.
To the logistics of our project, but above all to the needs of these communities.
I'm going to show you how it works.
It's a filter that works practically like...
It's a collapse.
[A.DE.]
[A.DE.]
The water contaminates, goes through the child.
And this one has all the particles.
Most of them, with a molecule of love - (Laughter) stop spending their crazy, clean water, retaining 99% of all these substances that are damaged on health.
That's it.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) It's a system of truth that it's the most efficient to bring clean water to quality in an immediate way, in addition, it's a completely revolutionary system and we consider that it's now the same weight of water to make the kit.
Can you imagine?
The impact of these paintings?
In the life of all these people?
I said, "Well, that's it."
It's Leo's story, Leo Cruz is a 21-year-old young man, we want to tell you a story.
That belongs to the 15th of October 15th, in the Trinidad, in Guatemala.
Leo had a dream: to study English.
And ending being a teacher in his community, but unfortunately, both he, like all his pobly, was in a lot of money and time to get drinking water, since the bastian manandial was very polluted by skeptics around him.
At our parade, Leo was written in an English course.
It's that you can't imagine the illusion that made us and the pride that was to be able to see all those people in those communities.
How did they spend large part of their resources?
To be able to fulfill among other things?
His dreams.
The truth is we don't have words to describe it well, we delivered 78 family filters and 14 community filters, destined to schools.
From now on, more than 15,000 people: Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
They will have access to drinking water during around ten years, and now, thinking about it, thinking in two years ago, when "Waterban Project" was a idea, they will have access to drinking water.
Well, we realize a little about the dream we have the opportunity to live, right?
But in this dream we've never had alone, before starting, more than 400 people ...
They brought their drop through a crowdfunding campaign which was destined to 100% to the exclusive purchase of water filters.
And nine months later, fortunately, we didn't tell ourselves for thousands, right?
(Laughter) Together, we have created a social movement that has made the trip of these four friends.
An unstoppable face against water crisis.
(Laughter) But it's still a lot, it's still a lot to do.
There are still millions of people who don't have drinking water and need our help.
Besides, the global crisis of water...
We call ourselves talking about the question of how it is possible, it can be one of the biggest risks of the greatest risks to have reached this situation, according to the World Economic Forum, which is not that we reach us.
The reason to have reached this situation is not another that we have an insufficient education and information.
In the West.
We have created so many necessities that we all know they are necessary, that sometimes we don't think about what they suffer from other people so that we completely satisfy all of them.
In this project, we have seen it with our own eyes.
We have lived it personally, we have developed a project in Mexico for many months.
Where we have seen how great embotellers were appropriating the manuals that supported the communities, so they were taking them out completely the access to water they had.
What do you think, for example, that they are doing for those lands, the great oil producers?
The big oil.
so that we, all of us, can win the deposit of our vehicles.
There's what they're doing is to contaminate, it's to destroy the forests and the rivers of communities or spiders of the Amazon, we've been there and it's hallucinating.
And in the future, what will cause probably is that it disappears to its culture.
It's not true.
It's really incredible and living it hasn't left us what has left us open.
It's really something that really seems and we really think it seems that it doesn't affect us any of us, I don't say it's like that, but it seems.
(Audience) Yes!
The world crisis of water is a reality that is not only.
The world crisis of water is a reality that affects November 12th, 2016.
It's directly affecting us all and each one feels in this room.
It doesn't need to go far away, in California.
A world of technological development is changing people to consume too much water.
They are cutting them in their minister.
For several hours.
In Spain, in Spain we also suffer drivers, we are one of the countries of the European Union that will suffer the cases of water in the future.
(Applause)
If we really want to produce a change, if we really want to impact on this planet.
What we have to do is all of us to motivate ourselves, to learn about these problems, and what we have to do is also educate all our children, all our families, about which are the problems and real needs.
And with that, what are the solutions that will really be sustainable of our city trying to reduce the consumption of water to that little NGO?
It's trying to build poths in Guatemala to dress these communities that, unfortunately, are still without drinking water.
Because we don't try, among all, to exercise a bit of pressure on governments.
Who are the ones who can really change?
The day these big companies would say, that today...
Of course, things are not doing well.
We really have to appreciate and value the incredible luck we have.
To reach our homes.
I'm going to open the glass of water.
And that it's always water, or it's not like that.
Let's stop hurting this resource, it seems not to us, but believe me, it's not infinite, it's not infinite.
But we have to act, we have to trust both and act, and we have to do it already.
Because, what happens if we really take awareness, but we don't act?
That's how we won't get the change we want to see in the world.
Luckily, there are many, many days to generate a positive impact in the world, to generate a positive impact in the lives of others.
(Audience) Yes!
This is our way of doing it.
What's your goal?
(Applause) (Music)
(Music) Wow, how nice it is to be here.
Keeping up so many faces, attentive.
I started the conference making a commitment with you: science determined that we are energy sources.
And that every time we think, we emit an electromagnetic frequency, that can be measured.
It can also measure the electromagnetic frequency of generating our heart, our emotions.
And it was proved that the emotion has a thousand times higher than the thought, the frequency of electromagnetic that generates a thought is measured.
And when we see the frequency that emits our heart, it's a thousand times higher.
So I'm going to do what my grandmother always said: "Nenny, talk about the heart."
I commit myself with you.
I'm going to talk about the heart.
And they open the heart, they can surely receive 1% of what I'm going to say.
And that we stayed stuck in our mind.
We just receive one part, so that's my commitment: to start the conference and ask a quick question, especially in front of me, to put ourselves in context: How is society today, raise your hand and tell me three or four answers?
It's fast.
That's not it.
Stressed.
PK: Revolved.
Confunded, aggressive, faced.
An accident of chain, well, in my conferences, I'll have 30 or 40 possibilities to give me this kind of answer, you've seen the answers.
And then there's another question, just give, right?
Someone in this room is happy that raise your hand those who are happy.
And well.
Those who read, raise your hand.
Let's see.
There are about 500 or 17 people here and everyone raised their hand.
I assure you, if I give you 100 possibilities that tell me how society is today, none of you has told me nor happy, nor happy.
You are.
What are we?
It's not society.
When we talk about society, what do we refer to, because here, 100% of society is happy and happy?
And if you've always told us more questions or more answers, you've told us in that line.
Sorry, discreet, faced, unmoralized.
Do you know what this is called?
Menter oriented to the crisis.
When you ask something, the first thing we say is...
Everything we need.
Everything that's wrong, what we're sitting in the media, where?
The answers that give sometimes we go to schools, we take the day to the kids, and we tell them, "Let's look for the good news, the bad and the neuters, the day's money, right?
How many good do you think they find or how many neutral?
One, two.
Now, well, this is what happens to us when we naturally ask a question, a impulse of how we see society, and then we have another big problem that has to do with the sports that are fashionable for me, the first national sport.
The complaint.
When we complain about everything, what cold does 7 of July at 7 am, first we complain about the weather, then we complain about the traffic, then we complain about my wife, and if we don't ask them something bad, when they ask me, "How are you perfectly good, full of happiness, what happened?"
"No, you don't have to complain anything."
So we have transformed a society that is "Jologos."
It's like a title we have, we complain about everything.
We have a second national sport that has to do with the complaint.
This can't be this, it has to change, this is a disaster, and this has to change.
And changing the country, society, my wife, all the time, we are complaining everything, so we transform ourselves in complaints, which is funny, complainologists, and maximum, or Pinologists and all of them.
Or, let's look at all, did you realize?
Some time they heard someone who says: "I don't feel able to do it."
We waited for everything, I introduced it with my friends, it's a friend Fernando who uses his camera with him, and I tell him, "She's because he rained the leaves, do you know why he rained the leaves?"
You'll understand that the owner is working there, well, we know everything, we think of economy, politics, etc.
And there's something more worrying about today: we've started to have our minds oriented to the crisis, we complain, complain.
And we are immersed in the opinion, what does it do?
We've fallen in a sort of vital stancing.
You have to get out of our house with the cared cell phone 100 percent and, in addition, we take a...
It's a chargator for the doubts that don't have a lot of load, but with our energy, loobat.
We started the day.
With a vital setting, with a chance of cancer.
Because, besides, you don't know if you lose power, why because if it's good?
We need everything to change, that the country goes well, that the weather does not know what, because it was little less beautiful and I arrived to give a conference and to see with the remix and I wanted wonderful, and the remix tells me, "Yes, but tomorrow it's in a rain."
This is how we're losing power, and there's something...
In this, I want to focus, besides being in this society and leaving this society, especially in our generation.
What have we left in our society in a moral crisis that was not even the most lost mind in our grandparents could be imagined, faced, restricted, but we are doing to believe in our children?
I want to be seen for nothing, that we are corrupt, mentirous, that the success model is the famine and the money we don't have the future.
We usually leave this, but we make them believe this, how this phrase is represented.
"Let's see how the archetees are."
And what do you want, we are in Argentina?
We listened to this and if they were in the world, they thought, "What can we do?"
But we only leave this society as it is, but also.
We make them believe in the generations they can't change.
A mistake, this is self-compliance.
Now, well.
For a long time, I was there and I started to understand that knowledge was important, so I graduated that hability was important to get out of that world where I lived, that I was complaining, I was a hell.
That the talent ...
It was important, I had to have talent, experience, and I was more informed in this, I saw that all of them joined, right?
So I looked for more knowledge, more ability, but one day I discovered something wonderful.
That all these things add, but the attitude multiplies.
The multiplying attitude and you know that all the amount of steel is zero.
If you, the attitude you have in front of life, is it zero?
This is a zero guy.
If you have a negative attitude, that's a negative guy.
If you have a pessimistic attitude, or a kind of pessimist, and if you have a sea attitude, it's a kind of merda.
Sorry.
So I started to say, "How can I get out of this attitude, how to get out of this position and the first thing I saw is that nothing changed, only changed my attitude and everything changed?"
I had a decision to change the attitude and what was to get out of that victim state that had of everything that happened to me and I started to decide to be a protagonist of my life.
I started to decide what I would do.
Those who looked for the changes I wanted to see.
I left the victim's posture of all the time being justified, criticizing, complaining, and I started to prove...
What happened as a protagonist, and the first thing I saw is that the installed is a square meter, this square meter, what I have, depends on me.
Each one of you has a meter, depends on you, from nobody else than you.
And of me, and you know what here in this square meter they live in the energy I want to vibrate.
This square meter lives in a respectful world, that's why I walk with a shirt that says "I respect."
It doesn't matter what you're going to do, or yes, but I want to share with you an example because I'm the leader of my square meter.
I started to show what I wanted to see, I started to decide to live in a different world because living in hell.
I went through the hell, I didn't remember once I went to the subway and I told him, "Dad, I'm three reasons why I'd have to keep living, wow, I was very bad."
I was in the nurse and I lived in the paradise.
Today I explore happiness every day in my life.
There's also me in love, full, but in hell and paradise it's not a place, it's a decision, because the hell I have it there beside, tomorrow I can return, it's a decision.
Where I pay to see everything I lack, not everything I have.
When I start to complain all the time and operate all the time and stop worrying about showing, leading, educating.
Because my square meter as I want, and you know that one is what you do, but also what you stop doing.
If all the time we're waiting for someone to change this.
Well, I went to London in many things.
In other words, we are what we do, but we are also what we stop doing.
They don't all have the same possibilities, we all have the same possibilities.
I started educating.
They say there are many ways to educate.
For me, it's a single one.
For example, every time we do something, someone is looking at us.
So, this is the way to educate, being the image we want to see, starting from our square meter, to emit energy first, protagonist attitude, I'm the protagonist of my life.
I'm the one who wants to change the protagonists of that change agent, he's not waiting for someone to reassure his life.
And from my master's square being sympathetic, starting to emit optimism energy, because you know that with the people you gather, you contagiate.
And if you're with a group of pessimist pieces, it's a pessimist.
If you're with a group of failures, you're failed, you're in a group of unhappy, that's unhappy.
If you start your square meter, to contagiate solidarity, optimism, you begin to emit that energy.
What energy does your square meter have?
From where you are, the important thing is not what we do, for me, the important thing is that what we do, we do it with all the love of the world.
In Pasco, a ice cream was bought, it doesn't matter here to not be advertising.
And I tell her to the girl: "Paris Pascuas, and he tells me: 300 people went by and I the first one that made me happy soccer."
And I said, "Hey, there are 300 people happy, Páscua."
"No, tell me, what are you waiting for?"
What are you emitting, your square meter, what a myth?
"What are you going to do?"
It's my respect, I respect, emite encounter, emite gratitude.
Amone unconditional, what you're emitting, what you do, because we're a source of energy, and I remember what you put, it's what you receive, this is like AME, if you're in AM and you're going from an AM to the other end, you're going to listen to FM, there's another melody.
And it's more, in the FM, you have the frequency you want to hear, you can choose, but if you're on top of me, because you don't go from one end to the other, you're going to listen to that.
In other words, the world is, as we create it, they live in paradise, but hell is a decision, they start to say, "The first game match against me."
"Oh, I get up, I don't get up."
"Well, I get up, I have a bad mood with a good humor."
With bad humor, or not with good humor, well predisposed, I see everything I have or I see everything I need.
It's all decisions, it's all small differences, excellence, believe me, it's this difference, the path you're going to grab is a Greek since you get up.
Those victims and protagonists.
You're going to show what you want to build for the generations that come or make the interests that are governing us and taking from domestic analysis.
People are conducted by fear.
My father told me an enormous heritage: "Shut up and fear, I've never had it."
That's it.
Let's say, "No, we are increasingly safer."
I'm going to tell you two life experiences with this foundation of acts and borders, which is the great blessing I invite you to see.
To know what we did, they went to the past, we gathered veterans of Argentine and Vitânic War, came to a Marim British Royal, and with a Gurcar.
And they gathered Argentine competers and together they gave a meeting message that nobody won.
And you know who locked the conference in my 12-year-old nephew, do you know what he said?
Ferra forbidden, which unity of measure is that.
And they taught me that they were the bad guys, and now I see that bad guys suffered as good as well.
No, our generation has to understand that war is not a tool, it's 12 years old.
I invite you to see it, and I'm going to tell you two stories of life that I had the selling of living with the Foundation for something without Borders, it was the year 2012, I went to work Tangagas to a conflict between reality and Palestine, which took 70 years.
A place where I was writing for lack, I thought there were a lot of things missing.
I understood that all the time I was worried about what I was missing, and one morning I see that a lady from the city of Belén came and hugged with other ladies and celebrations.
They are celebrating.
And then, the translator tells me that they filled the water tank.
What does "designant" have drinking water at home to take every week?
If you're celebrating that, their family of them will be able to name water.
And they celebrated it, right?
And at the afternoon, a 10-year-old boy who asked him,
Do you know what the genius in the radian lamp is through the translator?
"Yes."
"Mission, I don't have any idea."
So I'm going to explain what that genius is in the lady's lady.
And I tell him, "I have a desire, what do you ask me?"
The little girl looks at me, everything moved and says:
To give my hot water bathroom.
Like their great desire, right?
And at that moment...
All the time I was connected to what I was missing.
I realized that since I was born I had to think if I was going to have water to drink.
If he could give a bathroom, he would have...
Where to sleep.
So I lived in the same physical space, with the same situations, but I had changed my attitude.
I stopped being in the world of mind if I was in the world of the mountains and I realized everything I had, right?
And to conclude this, with this story I want to propose to you an exercise, all of you, in this state, that we are now.
It will have three steps in the exercise.
The first step, I ask you to close your eyes.
To everyone.
If you close your eyes, imagine yourself at this moment.
All the things we have, that we never give it.
Valor, we don't give them importance, as the fact of having a place where to sleep, to be able to bathe, to have water.
To start doing a mental list.
Of the things we never realize and thank, like health, as the possibilities we have.
Like our senses, our friends, so many things that...
That we give them for sitting, but never for them.
We list them.
The second part of this exercise has to do with it.
With all the people in this room.
That at this moment they feel, what have they been?
Vendicides or selected, or chosen for everything they have, all the people who feel a deep gratitude for the state of things they have done until this moment.
What expresses that gratitude?
Putting on foot, applauding the strongest thing we have, with what we have, with what we receive, very well above, (Applause) Thanks to the gratitude we have to express, for the protagonists that we can do in our lives, very well, for the love of our lives, who feel for the things that have received in their lives, if they feel at this moment, from this moment, from this moment, and applause of well.
The longest path to travel?
It's four palmates, when we make a look at our heads.
We connect with our heart or with our emotions.
When we can realize it.
Everything we have, but everything we need.
When we realize that hell and paradise is not a place.
But it's a decision.
We managed to pay for a moment the turtle.
And now I'm going to ask you to push this moment.
Do we have to feel this feeling?
And that each day of their lives, when they're going to give a shower.
Remember that...
Is there a place in a world of a 10-year-old boy?
Is the genius of the golden lamp?
I ask you what you're going to start doing.
And from that moment on, they realize.
That we can choose the path where we are going to transit, if we are going to go to hell or if we were going to go to the paradise.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Musicizing is to wake up the inner world and share it with others.
And we don't need to be an instrumentist or to be a musician to live music.
You know why, because music is already in us, since we are born in Latin, in pulse, in rhythms.
My life comes out, the sun comes out of the Moon.
But also the music of life in pauses, in silence.
And it teaches us the art of listening and being receptive.
Music is a language that integrates worlds since we are little and we play with the sound as if it were a toy, provoke Pach until we grow and carry music with us.
And also generates bridges, generates alliances between institutions, families, schools, to be able to go together and grow in a community.
Music generates rituals to accompany everyday life.
so that we can give us the welcome of asking ourselves through games and songs.
(Applause) Welcome to the talk and to your group.
(Music) (Applause)
Believe me, it's not easy to face such a sea of people.
That's it.
Imagine then what Bullying must be: bullying, physical or verbal aggressions that usually happen in schools, that's why they also know themselves as school support.
One of the most discussed and serious problems of recent times, social problems, however, five or ten years ago, I think few of us have heard this bullying word.
Although it also usually says that this is nothing new, it's something that has always happened.
In fact, beyond the age we have, we all have some experience with this kind of situations, because we live it in our own meat, or because we contribute to managing it against our own classmates, our poor partners, then in childhood, or because we simply appreciate it to someone to fly, now it's said "mullying."
Well, but I think this happens now and that we call bullying, in fact, is something new, you have similarities with what happened before, but it's not exactly the same, and this, first, before we didn't have a word to name it, or at least, wasn't this bullying word.
(Laughter) Notice, they didn't discuss it in the media, they didn't try to promote laws to coexist it or to penalize it.
Of course it could be a reason for many people and, in fact, it was, but it was thought it was something more or less normal.
It's capable of an indexed consequence, a lateral effect, with the indescribed side of the school coexistence, but not so serious, right?
Some could even think that this contributes to children's education.
But there's something important, and in that same time, that is, until recently, other school dramas were considered much more serious than those skeletons, without importance that occurred in recreations and corridors.
I mean the demonstrations, the exhibitions, even the bad grades.
Both the kids, like teachers, parents and general societies, thought that this was much more important than what we now call bullying.
(Laughter) Although now the opposite tends to do the opposite, which are the most serious castings, less serious, sorry, and this new phenomenon of bullying occupies a paper that is more central, the bad grades, and the disciplines, it seems that they are more serious, less serious, less serious, and on the other hand, they earn new ones.
School humiliation reasons, which are these castings that the same students apply between themselves.
For the most diverse reasons, but almost always related to the physical aspect or the personality of the victim: Well, if this is actually happening, the question would be why, why is this transformation in our values?
And I think it's a great historical change about which it's worth thinking.
Because we think that on the one hand, in those collar humiliation reasons, those most traditional conflicts, demonstrations, exulsions, bad grades.
What operates there is guilt.
To have done something bad, guilt is an internal emotion, private, a moral conflict is referred to a drama of each one with themselves, but everyone think that's bad, even me.
I feel guilty because I say something bad, now, in the case of bullying, it's not the fault what's in play, but another type of emotion, embarrassment.
That it's not exactly the same, it's quite different: shame is a public emotion.
It's not referred to a private drama of each of the same course, to have done something bad or bad, in the case of embarrassment.
The problem isn't me, but the others, the others, the gaze of others, that judges me in an uncle, unfair way, sometimes cruel, beyond having the fault or not of having done something bad, in general, I don't have anything to do, it's the others that exercise my cruel look.
(Laughter)
Because it seems to me that the genius look, the other's look.
And obviously it was always important, and at the moment of judging who each one is and how much it is.
And this wasn't always like that.
That's why I say it's a great historical change, and of course it's a very complex change, that it's not from now on, that it's managing, it's decades, and it's determining to consume now, it's crystallizing now, and it seems to me that one of the most important ingredients of this transformation.
It's the abandonment of the idea of internality.
What is that?
Well, it was a very important idea, a fundamental belief during the 200 years that preceded us and designed it from the Inte, the conviction that life existed before.
Something essential, but invisible to the eyes, that believed that it defined each one in a much more profound and true way than the apparences.
Those appearances are not only considered bananas, but also false, dangerous.
Like something smaller, something without importance, compared to the contundence of that true or inner beauty, well, I think all of this are values and beliefs that are still permanent among us, but that we are abandoning them.
Let's think of the whole phenomenon of the body that was developed in the last decades, the importance of personal image of the physical aspect, the subject of gymnasium, the aesthetic treatments, all that.
(Laughter) It also matters a lot, and each time it's easier to what you see, and you lose that notion that the most important thing of each one is something you don't see.
But that they are not the tribes that are inside each one, but that are not the most immaterial spirit, like the soul or the spirit, it seems that we increase less in that and more in what others can see.
And according to these transformations, others judge us from what they see, and less from that notion that there is something inside eternal, half-dictorian interiority, antiquated, which would be more true than the acts and the appearances.
Together with this, a series of transformations appeared, and one of them would be the self-promotion, the technical attacks of self-production that are everywhere, and that, until recently, would be considered something bad taste.
But let's think like an example: the conquest, the obsession to conquer the largest number of followers or likes.
No, this is also to prove that someone who exists and has value and that deserve to be looked at.
All the social networks phenomenon could also be seen as a test of this transformation, the success of social networks on the Internet.
Just like a set of infinity of symptoms, contemporary phenomena, since they go from tattoos to plastic surgeries.
Going through the kings and the bullying, but thinking about this broader context doesn't surprise that bullying has already transformed something so serious, so serious.
In other words, the fault is no longer as effective as the shamonestations and bad grades are increasingly less serious to produce effects in our lives.
And this, of course, is very complicated because it demands a generation, a administration of two vertents that seem contradictory on one side, we have to expose ourselves.
But on the other hand, it's always the risk that this fair look doesn't give us back to admiration, but rejection, burst, ignorance, that we are and what we do, so we have to cultivate and dissolve our image.
So we don't become more vulnerable to the agenda, for that same reason.
We also think about the complication, cyberbullying, when these burles or disseminate to the group of acquaintances or...
It's protected by the walls of the school or the house, suddenly it's exposed to millions of people, we all know it, so the shame is terrible, not much more serious.
(Laughter) Neither within oneself or intimacy, nor even dreaming of escaping an island of a certain island that there are fewer, or there is no more, at least no Wi-Fi, that is the subject, so it seems that this idea that hell is us.
It has become more true now, in the era of permanent connection and profiles, always visible in screens.
And with this dependence that we develop, with respect to the button, I like, that magical click, that we hope everyone to consider us before any selfie or whatever we have with respect to ourselves.
(Laughter) If all this is happening, in fact, this historical change, with these consequences and effects, the question would be: What do we do, this is better or worse than before, it's good or bad, how do we solve it?
And well, the bad news is that the solution is not good or bad in itself, it seems that both fault, like embarrassment, are mechanisms of social control, and the fact that the fault is losing a good part of its vigor, now, and that embarrassment is magnificating, that is not good or bad in itself.
But it's something we have to have in mind, that is, it's a data, because if we keep thinking that what happens now is the same thing that happened before and we try to solve as if it were the same, we probably won't get very far.
That's what he wanted to tell you, thank you (Applause)
(Cheers) (Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause) A few days ago we talked to my children at home and I told them we were living a historical moment.
That we wouldn't forget these days.
He let me tell me.
"Mom, I want to live in a historical moment, but the good ones."
But I work to investigate its education and I feel that the pandemic put us to the force, in a kind of educational experiment we choose, there will be something we can learn from this educational scenario that we can't go to the physical school, in these days I'm thinking a lot about that.
And I think so.
What are we learning in some important things?
And I would like to share with you these ideas that are walking around these days and that I hope, in one of those, we are part of the education of here, in front of me.
The first is that, for the first time, all of us, if we all have the urgency of animals taking new ways to teach.
And one day for another, we all, in simultaneously, had to help us give a huge step.
With a lot of effort and forced by emergency, those who dedicate us to teaching, we are having to redesign our classes to distance and in that process we are encouraging new ways to do things.
And for that, we realized that there was no way.
Doctors, tutorials, books in line, remote learning platforms, social media, video games, and especially to keep connected with students, with families, to reinvent the wheel, that there were many things that were already available, but that we had never had until now the urgency in periods needed to use.
That these days are, but so important.
(End of video) The good news in the middle of all this, I think, is that once we test them, we use them, these strategies already start to make samples, they start to be part of what we know how to do, of our tool box.
And little by little, in the middle of the frustration that brings, you have to adapt it so fast.
Even trying to determine patients, we do the same when things don't go out too, because we're also learning, we're going to grab the taste, to test new ways to teach and learn.
And this is not only happening in the formal system.
Today teachers and teachers of all kinds are teaching the line what they know from yoga classes.
Until workshops in tissue.
Even people, as a vocation of teaching is encouraging to do it, as you can see in these days, taught us the greatest that we started to show a space, the least in part, the second reflection of these days is that we are seeing what happens when we radically change how we use time to learn.
To choose what to learn?
And when and how?
And suddenly, and one day for another, that's happening.
In these days, many families started to realize that many times the kids, especially with only teenagers, others start with the subjects that interest us, others connect with the classmates to make the task, or a change in the web, to determine something that doesn't come out, or to learn something new, that they had desire.
And this also helps us think about the education of here, in front of us.
Because it makes us see that they are autonomy moments of children.
You can combine with other distances in which we are all together working on the wall.
And it also tells us that for all children and girls to take advantage of their most autonomous moments, we have to teach them, since very young people, to organize their tasks and everything they want to learn.
And my last reflection ...
It comes to me a question.
What happens when, in these days, we don't have the physical school as a place to go?
The quarantine is achieving that we realize, but not in a theoretical, declarative way, but in the body, I don't know if it's happening in every day, when we try to accompany our children in the school and in the huge task they are doing, and that they all make us learn, the difficult thing is to be a good teacher.
This pandemic is making more visible than ever the computers and the one who doesn't, the one who has the Internet and the one who doesn't, it's not just the ones who have computers.
The one who has here to ask, and the one who doesn't.
The one who has to do all care tasks at home.
And the one who doesn't.
(Laughter) The school.
With all their difficulties, during a single day, at least.
They put between parenthesis, inequalities and help all children and girls.
They are protected.
And with focus, of course.
And in the middle of the air.
Well, as an educator worries me a lot, as all this will follow, and I also ask myself what I'm going to stay of what we're learning in this quarantine.
My feeling in these days is...
When Maria's Malamaréa went to the Sunday beach, I hope that, as my son said, "This historical moment is not for anything good, it also helps us make those treasures we are finding."
The desire to explore in community is not a way to teach.
Let's replicate the use of time and learn and also.
Do we realize how much we need as a society?
From school and teachers.
Today, physics are closed, but in one of those I'm opening a door to build, among all of this, when all this happens.
It's an education we dream of.
Thank you very much (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) Nights dreamed that the quarantine lasted too two months and suddenly.
We used to live like this.
That the banks improved in the jungle and that everything could be paid for the phone.
That the trucks with food and houses and medicines traveled by the road against the remote conducted by trucks in a couch from their house.
That doctors operated by medicine, the patient at home, the doctor in the suit, X-rays, the chest and good nights.
That education at a distance worked even better than traditional education, because kids didn't have to get up to 7M to study sleep environments.
I dreamed that the workers of the State understood, finally, the functioning of Güble Drail, finally.
That the drivers learned to be cyberattacks.
That the mythomans and the chisms were revolved in the diffusion of conspiranous news through social networks.
And that those who before buying funds, pans, engineers shared those lies with their friends.
That all businesses worked for delivery and dreamed.
That it could be voted from home, but not only every four years in elections for president, every week it could be voted from home, abortion or abortion, we didn't appreciate a button.
Marigona Libre, yes, or Margola Libre no, we appreciated a button, we all said what it seemed to us and then won the majority of a day for the other, without northern scenarios, nor 14, deciding in the place of people.
I dreamed that the Church was also online.
The tablets gave them the jokes for YouTube, and, of course, it was forbidden to emit them by Youton Kirls.
I dreamed that an algorithm was replaced by lawyers and judges.
And that one day for the other, all those who had a right had to learn to play an instrument, to sleep bread, to do something noble.
I dreamed that we visited the world through Huble Hert.
And that in the end, we got used to buying the businesses of the neighborhood and that we did the line in the street, already automatically by Augusto, always keeping a meter and a half distance with the following.
I dreamed that when we saw a neighbour we greet them with the code.
I dreamed that we turned into monogams, but really.
And that the single people were looking for a love in the neighborhood and they started to live because the same thing they had before.
Or we hated loneliness.
And I dreamed that the soldiers who didn't want to live with anyone respected them because we realized that they thought all day in important things.
And that seemed very good to us.
I dreamed that the addicts had been recovered.
Or that they were addicted to something else: I dreamed that TED talks had to do them from home and do them from home.
And that they no longer lasted 18 minutes, but that lasted 6.
I dreamed that the State sent us a 3D printer, like in the field, and that in the field could buy important products, I dreamed that at night, in the big cities, they came back to see the stars.
They proliferated, suddenly, wild horse and lobos.
And then I dreamed that one day, many months later.
The government denounced the end of the pandemic.
And in a short communicated, the president told the town that it's possible to leave the street.
That it could be normal life, leave as if the president occupies their jobs.
They leave their homes.
Two minutes later, I dreamed that a avestruz crossed the nine of July.
And that we all went out as crazy at the street.
And we would run to the avestruz.
To make us a selfie with the animal and without wanting.
We fixed it and killed it.
And that a truck shocked against the green of the avestruz and returned.
And they fell from the truck filled with wine cardboard.
And that there would be more people at home, and then someone would punish the other, and the journalists who would be removed to the street, get out of selfies with the dead avestruz and steal the wine, and there were screams.
To transmit the living massacre, and then, above all, I woke up.
And I discovered that we kept in quarantine.
And I felt better.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
It's not something that when you see a photo...
Sometimes there are people who are a little more beautiful, but who appear a little more ugly in the picture, or people who are a little more ugly in the picture and who look more beautiful.
(Applause)
That fact caught my attention a lot, because if you think that photogenics exists.
It means that photography can't end with the living portrait, it can't move, so a few years ago it started actively to draw.
To give you the idea that when you draw, you draw what you think you're seeing, but not what you're seeing.
So I embraced that challenge of seeing with detachment.
To indagate the etymology of the gesture.
The visual stimology of what you are capturing and the idea of knowing.
It helps you see what you have in front of you, so when I go from walk or visit a place with little friends on Facebook, that we draw.
And we use it as a lab.
And we realized that a line is a place that came out of a walk.
That the eye is a very subtle lens and that to understand the invisible, we have to look at it with detachment visible.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
A few days ago I asked my mom how much did you think I could get to know a person from their social networks in only 30 seconds?
(Laughter) Punk told me.
And that's how I felt that faith and I suggested to prove it.
If I got to know at least 10 things of a person.
In those 30 seconds...
I would eat the last or a myth with a cream that was left in the wood, imagine my illusion when he accepted, I put the cranometer and I went straight to Instagram.
I wrote a letter from chance and entered the first profile that appeared.
I started until I started to see everything that person had published until the date.
It turns out that in a girl who, more or less a month ago, had climbed a photo with the beautiful number 18.
Besides, there were a lot of people, family, friends, Gachi Pachi, singing the movie, so I suggested it was a very friendly person.
Among these publications there were some arts pieces of bank, and I said, "This girl likes art," something that can later confirm with some photos she looked like painting.
(Laughter) So I kept going down, I kept moving down, and I discovered that those who are currently a better friend before.
(Laughter) What is a trans girl who grew up in school last year and who is now studying graphic design?
And among all that, I could also see that it's a very healthy person who attacks Lukele and who covers it, that is, which is very respectful with the environment.
For when these ten things had spent 28 seconds, my mom was very empathetic, I couldn't believe I could know a person like this from social networks.
It's true that in networks each of us chooses what they want to show, which is not because it's there, it means that it's something 100% real.
But even so, I think that what you choose to publish also shows how it is and what you want to be.
I think there is a fundamentally different way of getting to know other people comparing how we did a few years ago.
Before, everything I met this girl, 28 seconds, could have taken me months.
To give you a general idea, that person has to know details.
Today, thanks to social networks, that is to say that this became completely, and it's the opposite, and something immediate.
Thanks to this, I can know first details of the person as their personality, tastes, family, friends, and then with all that, to make a general image of the person.
Understanding, what's more than what I do in my first impression?
My generation is tolerant, multicultural and has a lot of social and environmental concern: this is much more potential in social networks.
An example is, like with the girl I found in Instagram, I didn't judge her to be trans.
That didn't work as a barrier for me to know it or for her to show her reality.
On the contrary, finding myself with what I see on the other helped me question what I'm seeing in the world.
After doing this kind of challenge with my mom, I came back to see some publications called my attention, like the ones I spoke about, to take care of the environment.
And then I started to ask myself, "What am I saying to take care of the planet if I really want to take care of it and if that's how I'm going to do it?"
While I spoke to my mom and I was very funny with a crime.
So we asked ourselves how these 30 seconds are transferred to our daily encounters.
And that's when I realized that this different way of getting to know others, which are in social networks, passed the screens and is present in my daily encounters.
And my behavior in the real world, that's how to say it, changed completely.
To find myself with a person I don't know, I don't look for a label to frame it.
I try to know it more in that first instance.
I look for details, those of those I mentioned at the beginning.
(Applause) I ask you all and without playing, and obviously I ask you to use social networks, thank you very much (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
What does it mean?
But it's not that the attention to this image for a moment, please.
What parts of the face think they're looking at?
You can be aware of how your eyes move in this image, what you see first, what comes afterwards.
Surely everyone will have happened at some point.
For two eyes.
For different parts of the face.
Have you ever had anywhere?
Indeed, some artists, like Alberto Jacometi or Leonardo da Vinci knew that the eyes weren't the only relevant element to build the look of a portrait.
But also the birthal buildings, the commissors of the mouth, the edges of the ears, the pores and the details, were fundamental elements to constitute what we would call: "The look of the portrait."
It was as if, somehow, these affections were overcome.
What were the parts of the face that the spectators were looking for?
To elaborate a portrait, to put evidence in subjectivity through the constitution of a look.
And at the same time, it's looking for the other, the one of the spectrum.
So we thought what it would be if we can see how a spectator looks at.
In a positioning team, in a neuroscience lab, we put several portraits in many people and registered the movement of the eyes in front of that image.
What we get is how we build the image in time.
How do our eyes choose to determine the specific parts of that face to extract information, since the rest constitutes it in the brain?
If we put all the images together in the image, we could see what relevant parts are when we sleep, the portrait, and which is not.
In some way, it's as if this dynamic was the encounter of that gaze, of the portrait we talk about, and the look of the spectators.
It occurred to us to think then how a portrait generated by these gestures of the looks, all together, the look of others.
What we built was this that today I'm showing you and that I wanted to share with you.
This very previous trial for the record of an eye.
It's one of the projects that took together with Mariano Sigman in the intersection of art and neuroscience.
They are interdisciplinary projects that we like to think in a way like a trip.
A trip through different landscapes, customs, languages.
In which we transit with some maps of art and several leaves of rule of science, but that is fundamentally.
(Applause) What encourages us is the search of the stadium, the questions, the exploration, thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
In the exact moment we are born?
We started to age.
The aging.
It's the flow of life.
The most natural process of human beings.
However?
It's the most resistant.
We invested so many resources to live more and more years?
And even so?
It seems it's a stage we don't want to get there.
Nobody wants to be old.
Why? Because we don't know
A few years ago, when I started working in the subjects of longevity, many people asked me, "What do you do, so young, taking care of old people?"
It's my future, I told you, who survived many years and that's how I'm going, what I didn't say at that moment.
And it's one of the most powerful reasons to get involved in this subject.
It's fear.
Fear to be old, no.
Fear to live in a society where the most important thing is to be or to be young.
Fear?
That my knowledge and experience are losing value.
That my word ...
It wasn't taken into account.
Fear to stay in the margin.
All of this is happening today to millions of people.
The discrimination for age is the most extended in the world.
And the older women who suffer the most.
Besides, linked stereotypes continue to be socially accepted.
We can see them.
In advertising, in workplaces...
Well, in the jokes we do.
And the worst of all.
It's that we don't even perceive them.
Or we let them happen.
These stereotypes fit older people.
Let's take some generalizations that all put in the same bag.
For example, this common idea that older people are sick or depend on others.
When the data of the male debt of social debt tell us that 70 percent of older people, today in Argentina, are self-valid.
That is to say that you can take care of yourself and take care of others.
Or this belief shared that the elderly are sad or depressed?
When 80% says being happy.
And that is much more than what people manifest in my age or even younger.
Or this passive class label?
A passive class, who just seems to me that definition?
Because it doesn't represent so many older people who are working today, creating.
Are they doing sports taking part in volunteers?
by taking care of others.
stereotypes are very powerful and have a huge impact in people's lives, because they determine social and institutional behaviors.
If I ask you now for a minute to think of a person carrying forward a super innovative project.
Can you imagine someone like that?
Do you know how difficult it is for a 65-year-old person to get a credit or a funding for their project?
Even when it's shown that projects where older people have more successful probabilities.
However, I never found a scholarship.
Neither a call, nor an opportunity for funding.
That includes them.
Another example: the empty that exist in the health field.
In most public universities in our country, there is no geriatry matter.
Medicine students graduate to treat young adults.
Not older.
Everything related to aging is just a topic.
In general clinic.
Is that how we are preparing for the new longevity we suffer to get?
Or what's happening with university teachers, in any field, that at the 70s are invited to get rid of age issues.
(Applause)
Who defines that chronological limit, every 69 can give class?
And at 71 no.
Communication media are not helping either, because they reproduce and magnify these stereotypes.
A while ago, in a meeting with a national media, I asked them why, every time they treated the topic of older people, they used the same photo.
That of the older person in a plasma bank, giving them to eat the 'Palomas'.
Do you lock it?
It's the only thing we have in archive, it was the answer.
And so bad press has old age, that in addition to images we lack words.
Adults older, third age.
Travels, old are the traps.
Girls.
Antians.
I still don't find a word that identifies or conforms to everyone.
The only one that suggests to avoid is grandfather or grandmother.
I know they are their grandchildren, of course.
It's because of affection some justify.
But if it's for affection, I could tell myself "mamita," because it's a woman in reproductive age, and it doesn't correspond.
Most people have a name.
It's like everyone.
I'm going to give you an example.
stereotypes stimulate them.
Excuse me.
And they become invisible to many.
Today, in Argentina, there are 6 million older people of 60 years.
In 2050, there will be more than children and teenagers.
It's the social group that grows the most.
And this is also happening in the world.
We are already an old society.
And we don't want to see ourselves.
Neither to join.
If we were assumed, we would discover a world of opportunities.
To innovate, to create jobs, to design new products and services.
This new longevity opens doors so that we rethink the next years in the economic, in social and cultural.
I'm going to give you an example.
In this country?
One out of three older people says that their needs of recreation and entertainment are little or not satisfied.
Or that if they had the opportunity, they would continue studying and forming themselves.
However, the offices and education that exist are thought almost exclusively for children and young people.
All these opportunities we can't detect them intuitively.
Because the elderly are a very different group that doesn't respond to traditional patterns that we still have in our heads.
Besides.
Many of us still don't go through that stage.
That's why my proposal is that we listen and learn from older people to really understand what their new needs are.
His new possibilities, desire and tastes.
A while ago, interviewing a older person, I wasn't clear if I wanted to do activities with people of their age or with more young people.
I asked him, "What do you want?"
I want to be in life.
Each stage in life has its potential.
To discover it, we have to add our stereotypes.
And contrast them with the new reality.
Because old people are not the others.
Children.
We are us and those we are going to do, thank you very much. (Applause)
