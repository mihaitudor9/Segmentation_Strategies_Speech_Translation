I have a message for their children and grandchildren. I need you to help me swim. It's very simple. Well, we need it. And to learn, to feel, to think and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lomboca's star, in Indonesia. Well, at 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity surrounded by a great biodiversity, of tortures, of golden fish, of all colors. I had a feeling of being connected with nature. It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience. So, at that moment, I observed a small fish. "Are you fragile?" And blacks and yellows came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me. We were looking, right? And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself. It was a very spiritual feeling, and what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, it's the same thing my students think at the university every time I tell him, look at each other. And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy. But I'm not crazy. (Laughter) And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. He works 24 hours during a week. To draw that artwork we're going to see. Or, on the contrary, the maritime stream would take it: that mandate we see proves that nature has consciousness and that I don't develop it. And if I'm able to talk to fish. Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, rocks, mountains, and with other natural phenomena? And I think so. Last year, the Scientific magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of diverse idol were analyzed. Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of three rooms between companies and predators. That is to say, for every four bottles there were three lions, or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? Paradoxically, from amazing forms to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced. And I agree with the law of Clayber. A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse. DB: But three, four. And if they stop thinking about it. The planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right? So I ask myself, is it a mere coincidence or really nature has an inherent consciousness? After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution. That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research, that is, all those sciences that integrate and unify. Well, the history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the history of the human being. That's when I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development, and here I bring you a summary. I agree with my scientific consensus. The universe came up to 13,700 billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4.500 and 5,000 million years ago. And the miracle of life between 3800 and 3 500 million years. During the first half of this period, you set up a wide range of multi-cellulating organisms, like, for example, that have developed supervivent strategies, with the complex exclusion of the chain, the trophy. The following thing seems to indicate that life came up and the depths of the oceans, it wasn't able to reach the Earth until about 450 million years ago. In fact, it's known that the other libraries have four million years ago, the homosexuals have two million, the near dental men and Homo Sapis, 200,000 years ago, started the hegemonic period of the mammals, thanks to the possible rests found until the year. (Laughter) Actually, Homo sapiens is the only survivor of human species that cohabits and co-evolution in the planet Earth, along with the rest of its biodiversity richness. From the agricultural revolution, which domesticated animals and plants for about 10,000 years, and especially from the Industrial Revolution of about 250 years ago, human beings are adapting the environment in a transcendental way. But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed. It's as something unbearable. A species between species. In a 30-year-old Parliament, or maybe 100 million species, a single species, a nitanoma. It's destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species, and that, if it's crazy, and we're all responsible. Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs, but the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him. In this half of the 20th century, the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them. Well, if it seems we've forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, teaming the thermal fusion of the stars that can reach the 65 million degrees of degrees, and that's why it was little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological farm we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth. In the mid-90s, human beings have overcome the limits of biofysical regeneration of the Earth. QD: Since 1990 to the year 2020 we'll predict that we're going to lose 40% of planetary biodiversity. According to the World Forum of nature? If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours. But we don't have four planets, it's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming, and what does this mean? Imagine that we close the doors and the windows of this theater, and we take fire to the bottles you are sitting in. Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. Darwin told us that only survives the strongest resources, those who adapt to the middle, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation. If it's true, there is violence and predation and excess, in any way. In life, in nature, what defines what defines it. It's not competence, but cooperation, I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach an egg to fertilize it. What defines life is not that competition, but the union withoutbiotics has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one, that defines life, cooperation. For example, soccer, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it. Our body is a plural cell phone organism where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are. Paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect to reach sustainable societies, after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what loses in time, it has suffered catástrofes of global ice creams. Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed the communism that also failed socialism, and capitalism has also failed, has more money than the rest of 99. And that's it, if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren, that is not adapted to this socioeconomic system that is sick, pathologically, and that is psychopathic, because it's signed to nature to obtain economic benefits and recycle the bottom of the sea. The money has colonized life, and that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. And it's something that's inside all of us, we all have this faculty, I invite you to imitate and imitate life, but this is not new, this is already doing it in the original peoples, indigenous people, and I invite you to play a game. Let's imagine. What happens to them with this verb? How could engineers, architects, economists, inspire us? Well, they occurred to them to make a plane? What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"? Well, the Japanese did the train Bach. And with this murciano? We could make a trunk, right? And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites. We could make bioclimatic buildings. And with this is Girasol. A plant of solar boards, as we know, there are millions of species in nature. Bio-inspiration is practically infinite. But we keep thinking that nature will always be there, and we have to overcome the cognitive face of the GDP, what does the GDP mean? I'm going to upload a lot of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material. But for the industry. We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a préstamo of our children and grandchildren. And what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started? Can you imagine? A dialogue future with their children and grandchildren, I would like them to tell me: "Dad, at least you try it, fight." PK: And you. What would you like to hear? Thank you. And I have to tell you that the quarantine has our opportunity and the pandemic is not an opportunity, they are horrible things, we're going to do everything missing, but it has many complicated consequences, politically, economically, we're going wrong, socially to our friends. If we succeed, if we're going to keep doing it, we don't have anything to do with respect, and we don't know why to think it's an opportunity to take advantage of it, and that's a great moment to learn, it's a great moment for nothing, it's a horrible moment, we're going to do now. And what we have only to enter? It's an idea in which I was meditating from a book. And what impressed me was going to take care of a garden, and then he decides when the diagnosis of HIV returns to his childhood to the gardenery, three exams of a sign that, in fact, after his diagnosis, is very important, some of his career space, but what he decides that he's going to buy a terrible place in a horrible place, as a person, as a writes. It wasn't that for him to take care of a garden wasn't to spend the time, not like now that we spend the time cooking or doing bread. Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks that are promised are those." And this reproductive work, which is to reproduce the conditions so that we can do that: clean, cook, copy, take care of, and think, then, in the concept of reproductive work, not even the productive work, which is a concept that comes out of sexism, based on gender flows, basically, and we take a lot of time. By increasing correctly, that reproductive work is also work. And even more, because we don't do what we produce, what we argue is that reproductive work has economical value and reproductive value is a difference because it's useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat in the manufacture. It's something that doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you originate, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't make you an important thing, it's something that doesn't make you special, it's important, these are the producers, the smells, and the reproductive networks, because it's not important. Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important ones: How many days are we living without writers? Yes, a lot of things are moving without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning, but the world doesn't go spinning without food and without care. And without health, the only thing that allows us today is to eat and cure and clean. And if it's a magic world, then? These tasks have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value, and not only that, but that cooking, not only seeing food, that hope not existing, picking one could do that, clean the house, we can think it for a long time. But what I thought when I read to Germans is that we can also live them in another way, we can live them as tasks that have a wisdom, such as tasks in which we also have. We are also interested in it, we are involved as human beings, that are not methaneic, and that also has to do with our bodies, we think that we have to be careful with nature, human beings separated from the natural world that are not mechanical, and that only has to be healthy to do other things, not the things that matter. He looked at me. But that's also a very strange way of thinking our relationship with our own body, not thinking that our mind is what we are. And that the body will do something we have to overcome. Well, this is not an opportunity. In fact, I want to return to my life, we all live in this contradiction and this life for absurdity now. "To give you the world, you need more novels, I thought, well." Why not connect with the world, with the body, with the careers, with the others, and to know all the colds, and with all that, why not think of being productive in these days in another way from that? That's why, when they invited me to do this passive that I don't know, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world hasn't been given that novel and the world doesn't need any other idea. But that's why I thought, in fact, we were going to write to read, bring something I read, something that made me think of something that already existed in the world, what I was already, a care that I had with my books, and that I wanted to tell other people, what to do, take care. Thank you. M.B: People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat. No more bread, no more sweet, no more posters. Have you spent every fifteen days, a end of the middle? This food is not fat, it's the misunderstanding way and disordered in which we consume them, but that's why I want to name three key aspects to have a good food, the first is consciousness. (Video) Once, a teacher told me: "The consciousness rate is secondary to brain activity." And with brain activity, sorry for experts in the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if consciousness is secondary to our desires? We would never choose a food we wanted to eat, but the opposite, the one we don't like the most. And after this, we are aware of what we are feeding, what we are eating and in what quantity. KA: A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger. Because when we have hunger, there's no blood of apple. Well, it's hungry of everything, it's hungry, it's more calorical. And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attentive, right? The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas. B, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double weight. So, that's it. Going back to the subject. We are really able to say "Pixa", "No thank you," I prefer a "guardol." Impossible, right? GV: The second aspect is the practice. To eat, like every process in life, is learned. And in this case, and in many cases, I include myself re-aprends. We must learn to eat in station, what does this mean, to eat the food that have been harassed at that time. This will guarantee us a control and an equilibrium, our weight, and by making a god in our health. Because foods are made of their own, of their time. They are the most natural foods. They are the richest foods in nutrients, that is, they are not addicted with calories, that is, they are not chemically addicted to subsist in time, or is normal to see tomatoes in winter and summer. So this mechanism has led to practice. It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating mine. The last aspect? For me, it's not smaller, but it's from the most important ones in moderation. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many of you give them anxiety. And I have a question. They also give them anxieties. Let's repeat the plate of purchasing with frites? To think, right? I don't know. What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates? Because hunger is not manipulable if they are restricted in food, if they get out of food. What is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion. To be more graphic, it's like a snowball that comes from the top. Every time with more size, every time with more volume, and every time with more strength. So if we don't stop each three, four hours. I'm going to take a collection. That snowball will unfold in the first moment we have the opportunity to eat. And we're going to disappoint all the food around us. To go over. Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to be, the weight I'm going to lose and not. The most expart body becomes to reserve, to look. And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body. The food only makes you fat, we leave in favor of ignorance, the food can hurt you or be cured, it depends on us, of taking awareness, with what we are feeding and in what quantity? Well, I return to moderation. That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation. That food stimulates overview. To give it a closet. I propose you to eat rich, eat everything you like, eat varied, but always take care of the portion. (End of video) Not for anything there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "Almuerza as Prince" and "Sena" as I mentioned. I think many of us know it. (Laughter) The health has excuses: "I can't, I don't have it, I get hungry, or even worse." Sometimes I died of soup. We have four opportunities a day. To choose how to take care of and feed healthyly. Thank you very much. A while ago I was obsessed by telling stories of scientific women: I love it, the first one that seemed obvious to me, Marie Curie, they didn't give a Nobel Prize, they gave them two. So it deserves its pedestal. But there are many others who didn't win a Nobel Prize but did incredible things. Little by little, I entered the story of Eugenia Sacerdote. Eugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated Argentina at the time of the second war and made great contributions. Among them, the most important thing was the one that brought the vaccine against polio in the 50s, thanks to it, thousands of lives were saved, I'm a scientist, and more or less since 2002 that I work at the university until 2004. And they say it was very guilty that you could talk to her. And do you know what happened in 2011, I was 111 years old? But I found her very little. How did I lose it, not give you an idea to the bronk that this gave me to have found them very little, a lot of bronk, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, to honor those who were done, but, above all, to not lose salt? (Applause) We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography. What about the kids? They keep losing a lot of time in school. With ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. Is there a new ortography missing? I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have. And the question and the answer are new in our language, they come to bounce back in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Castellan language. Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography, a clear and simple principle: that's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write. Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, the one who says that we have to write, according to how we were going to uniform our writing, there was another criteria that was never differentiated in its original language, in Latin, in Greek, and so we stay with wings and decades. Three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but in none to three. I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience, we all went to school. All of us invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and infant, indicated brain, in the memorization of ortographic rules full of our training. However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled? What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less trascendent than it usually creates, ortography is useful to uniform writing, so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's no easier to understand when we read it, but in contraposition with other aspects of language, like this. And I, with punctuation, can choose to change the meaning to a phrase with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with the ortography, no, but then it wouldn't be easier to teach and use correctly ortography. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the old norms? To give all that time to the teaching of ortography, we can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort. And what I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not. It seems that each one writes as they want. The language is a common use tool. And therefore, it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria. But it also seems fundamental to me. Because those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done. Especially. Because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down when ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel anything. It was the quality of language. Shot. I work every day with the literature to say it about Ololego, Garcillazo, Servantes, Agongora, what do I see? That sometimes they write "men," "sin H," sometimes they write "scribe with a decoration" and it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours. It's of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality. But let me return to teachers, because they are personal. It's key in this story. I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive. With teachers knocking us and knocking us with ortography. But the truth is that being things like you are, that makes sense. In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content of what is written: you can get or stop getting a job by a H. You can become a bubble object, because of a misunderstanding bird. But then, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography. But we shouldn't forget. Because throughout our language history, they were always teachers. Or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed ortographic reforms, those who realized that in our ortography sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge. In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had the place. It was in Spanish tongue, from Chile, on average. In the 19th century. Why not take the bet on those teachers? And start. I wanted to move forward in our ortography, me here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I wanted to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. We eliminate Hémuda, where we wrote an H. (Laughter) But we don't pronounce anything, we don't write anything, it's hard to think that kind of sentimental attachment can justify for someone. All the fats that cause the H-Muda H. Bélarga and B-Courta said before: "Je-hi-jota," we divide the functions, which is the Sweden sound, Gatos, Mago, Aila, and that the joke retains the sound "asperó." Garave, giraffe, people. It's Argentine. I know. Because that, Iceta, is an interesting case. Because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the differences of pronouncement must be attended; I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two, and from three letters, we go to two. We are all better. Some of these changes may seem a little dramatic. PK: They are not so much. The Spanish Academy is linked to the stories, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes this appeals to history, traditions and customs. It is transformed into an obstacle for today's use. That explains, in fact. That our language is much more. That those we know, that we have geographically close. We were historically modified, for example. We went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol, to symbol. And little by little, now they start to remove themselves exhausely some moved haches in the dictionary of the academy: harp, harmony, they can write with H or Sinache. And we're all fine. And it seems to me too. Well, this is a moment. I was particularly appropriated to face this discussion. It always tells us that language changes spontaneously, below, up. They are the users who incorporate new words. Those who introduce gramatic modifications. And that authority, in some places, is a academic, in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry. In other words, a long time later, they accept them and incorporate them. This is true only for some language levels, it's true for the text level, for the words level, it's less true. (Laughter) For the grammatical level, and almost I would say that it's not true for the level of ortography that has always historically changed from above. They were always the institutions that fixed the norms. And they proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use than speech? But at our time, the time of social networks is suffering a revolutionary change. It never was described as much as now, they never wrote so much to the view of so many. And in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school, novelous ortographic uses, where even unpected ortography people, when they write in social networks. It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication. And I said, "Thank you. There are chaotic, individual uses, but I think we have to pay attention. Because they probably are telling us that a time signs writing to a new place. I'm asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we'd do bad. They wanted to reject them. To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them. It's inside a more affine normative with the needs of our times. I can anticipate some objections. There will be those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic, with a simplified ortography. We're going to recover etymology at the same place where we're going now, to the etymological dictionary, a second operation of those who say. If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguishing between these words that are different in only one lyrics, that's true, but it's not a problem. Our language has ormonies, it has words with more than a meaning, and we don't confuse them the bank where we sit in the bank where we deposit money, the suit that we put on the things we traveled. In the enormous majority of situations, the context dissipates any confusion. But there's a third objection. And for me? The most comprehensible, even the most conmovedor, the one they say. That's why I don't want to change. I educate myself like this, I get used in this way when I read a written word in simplified ortography: "My eyes hurt." That objection is within each one of us. What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to? And you wait for time to feel. There are the new norms. The success of all ortographic reform that touches so arraigated habits. It's in the prudence the consensus, the fat-alism and tolerance. But we can't let the trail, the old customs, prevent us from going forward. The best tribute we can do to the past is to improve what we receive. So I think we have to agree that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography. All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us. And I'm convinced that we do that. And in the modest environment. But importantly from language, we're leaving them to the next generations. Here's a future. It's better. Thank you very much for my father to die, I remember looking at him in the eyes. I had the eyes of coffee with a joy around the IRIS. (Laughter) And saying to me, "Don't forget your eyes." After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death. Maybe for my training as a photographer. Instinctively, just like when they give us hunger. And I felt the need to look at her seeds at the microscope. For surprise of all the scientists I approached, who made monocromatic images. (Laughter) The discovery I made transformed my view of the world. Well, the whole universe enters in my mind. It was like being floating in the universe. It was like being that space, an exciting space, without body. It was absolute content, it became a father. This image. Let's see it. And that's the image of my microscope father's seeds. And this other is the brother of someone else, and that's how I could teach them infinite. All my fear and my sadness disappeared. I didn't feel disconnected from anything or nobody. His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life, of Tsun Project. For me, this teaches that our most pure material essence we are scared by the cosmos. And that when we look at the mirror, there are perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe. And that matter is not created nor destroyed. It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. Thank you. In Argentina, the INBAP. This is a society of the State that develops atomic energy. And space technology. Because their satellites travel around the planet. It's the best example, maybe we have of the ability the state of innovating. B.G: We shouldn't create an IBAP from education. Imagine a public agency. That designs content and strategies to transform learning. I worked with schools to rewrite what happens in classrooms. That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale. A agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, artists, philosophers, teachers, many of you. For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term. They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management. And the first step. And it's thinking about the state as possible. Not like the variable of all the adjusts. Just like that, changes in education will not benefit from the most advantages. (Applause) I'm not a scientist, and a few years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations. Invasions extraterrestrial, from great loves, to pandemic. And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves questions. From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide. Well, for example, the world's obsession could buy mountains of hygiene. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous has an unconscious logic. In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer, it's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive. And it's that failure lives with more relief if we know we've made a great effort to try to remedy. But it's also very unique to humans to try to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public. Thinking that, in fact, we don't make any other principle of human psychology, the same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we talk about the phone or the worst, while we send messages, call the optimistic blind, it won't happen to us. He made the great politicians in Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity for the current time. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals, why does this happen now to us? And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas, for example, in the Budonic Pest, the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States. Actually, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones that were really propagating the disease. In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already in a contage of others, but in Japan, they are willing everyone to use more squares. This first makes people who are healthy or contagious, it's very important, but there's another most important reason, which is that if they only use more expensive diseases, knowing who is sick and who doesn't use the most expensive. That they use it all over the world is a way to avoid self-esteem and with this, to take care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered in our traditions, in our habits, in our days, because it's impossible to change, but it's true that education can't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it, and, however, in three days, now all kids educate in their house. We don't know even about the consequences of this, but we learned that we are willing to make it the award need, and the world keeps moving. Also, of course, our values, our judgment. About two or three months ago, when the pandemic started, the Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes, for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible is that everyone has to stay at home seems completely priority. And on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to do a small mental experiment: it's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future? Imagine the next situation. We are at the beginning of the pandemic: a public consensus that includes the World Health Organization, but also to cover our public sectors, has the capacity through some technology, to know where we are, where we are, and also data of our body intimacy. Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our face is viral, and it can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of getting infected and who. Imagine that with this we really activate the effect of epidemic, and if we go to this mental experiment, we suppose that this consensus can use this information to restrict the movement of people in a specific way, it can come out, it doesn't disappears completely, but it die a lot less people than the economy and the world in the way we see it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk that they were a bad use of them is still true, there's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic and you could choose if it looks good or bad to do this? What would you do? I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention that is there, between one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values, pillar in our culture. On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemic. Maybe, accepting our data is a bit like vaccinating us, it's a succession that we make of one of our many freedoms as part of a social impact, to take care of us. And to everything. A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom, we found a good solution of commitment. Sex. Compreservative. That's it. When all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free and care? Are you going to fly less in a sky? Would we change the way to greet ourselves? Are we going to be part of our taste as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely that we never want the preservative sex of the coronavir. My first encounter with a fossil. It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina. I had been many times in museums, with rooms full of dinosaurs that fascinated me, but this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field. In the middle of nowhere. It was a animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before. The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind, we call it "dolars of sea," are relatives from sea herits. And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia 15 million years ago. At that moment, I knew all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out. And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know. And they are extremely fragile. The dollar of Mar fell down, the sand fell down. And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way, but I was interested in the fossil or fascination by these past beings, to imagine how our planet had been in the past. They continued captivating me and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet, approximately 100 million years ago. Our planet was very disappointed by dinosaurs and other kinds of reptiles. And I told you 100 million years ago. And it's a quantity that paleontologists mentioned daily, but very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stage, which is a lot of people. Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people. That's it. 10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a amount that doesn't enter the field. And that, multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life, is a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us. (Audience) In my head. But well, the life helped me study how the world was 100 million years ago. I've traveled. I've studied fossil fuels of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, the South of China, South Africa, asking fantastic fossils, but it has also led me. A very special place. So, what is Patagon? And when we say "patagonia." Naturally, we think of these landscapes, forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes. But for us, paleentologists. KA: Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils that remain to be discovered. We know, fortunately, many dinosaurs we know about Patagonia are one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and the great majority of the dinosaurs we live in in Earth. What we call critical period, this is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere. The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios, while, at that time, in the northern hemisphere, other kinds of carnivores, like the dinosaurs, where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belonged. And this difference between the North of the South wasn't surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated, isolated the continents of the North hemisphere. But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call the Jurassic period, a hundred million years before? At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea. And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the healing hemisphere. And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet, for the first time they reached giant size for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the living niches of carnivores of omnivores in the whole planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagonia's jurassic. And that leads me to one of the stories in the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found it four years ago, in Cerros like this, walking a lot of heat afternoon. And after walking all day, I mean returning to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks, on the floor. And I got closer, as I got closer, I saw again more clearly what it was. It was the traffic of a dinosaur. I approached, stood next to me, stood up, really. I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what was the track of a carnivor dinosaur. But I couldn't really believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life. Then, despite the rest of the team, and after several celebrations, the next day we started the task. To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers, as we do to transport it to the museum. And we started to take it low. But the expedition was already over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum. Until the next time given the winter came. It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the strange we had found, or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day of the statition. We realized that it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rarely. Clearly, the animal was dead in a lake and had already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact position in the dinosaurs: a complete skeleton, preserving in an intact way its exkeleton. And then the excavation really begins: reading, staying, cap, those sediments that were shaking, where it would open us, it's a very exciting moment, it's for the first time, going back to the surface, an animal that lived in that same place, but 60 million years ago. Jennemal had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, that they kept accumulating up to gather meters and meters of sediment caps, and in that same process, bones turned into fossil fuels for chemical reactions. Then all that package of hidden rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming of all this block. And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning. These layers, layer, until they start discovering. The layers I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills, looking for. Those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting. And discovering games is a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun. The Patagonic wind, that doesn't lose, and then we were able to take all these protected remains by layers to the lab. In the museum's lab, another stage is extremely long, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big. All the rocks that cover the bones of these dinosaurs. And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we could see this dinosaur's carnivores, studying anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that this family had originated 100 million years before. That's what we thought. A lot before the South hemisphere and the northern hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent. Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there. For example, of some rocks like these that we transported to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside, we were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rocks. Skeleton was quite complete and he told with a very well preserved channel and with some very strange teeth, in a way of hand, and that's why we call this "man and Dance." For this dinosaur, it's very particular. For something very special, one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, which is a very small dinosaur, one of the smallest in the world, or complete skeleton, wouldn't take more than 50 cm from the end of the tail. And this dinosaur mining didn't look like in anything to the forms we found or met from the North hemisphere, studying its rest we could see that its closest relatives. They had been found in South Africa, in Atlantic Ocean, which separates these two continents, but this wasn't so surprising because if you see in the South Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to each other in this time. of restricted animals, unique from the hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the northern hemisphere. We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern. And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that lived at this time, in many fossils that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big black circle, it was a great desert what was isolated to this fauna making the evolution in an independent way and completely separated from the fauna's fauna's fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water. And when we think about dinosaurs? And we found fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we really found fantastic, fascinating things: they have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life. They have diversified and conquered all terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing. It's that they take us to understand chapters like this, the history of the planet. And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives. Learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. The Earth is a big book. With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years. (Laughter) And life. It occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years. That there are millions of pages yet by reading this book. And if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today, is fundamental to know their story. Because knowing the past is key to understand the present. Audience: Yes. It's also key. To design a future. Many of us. So, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers. anticipating what they would later read so much books and see so many movies. I dream of competing and containing magical powers to build things. I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible and invasors. Then time gives us a reality bathroom. It loses subtle and you don't have the magical variety of Harry Potter. Sometimes, without losing small villages, and trying to understand how these superpowers work, but something about that vocation of children that hurt me and almost without realizing it, all my life dedicates me to looking at me and you don't have the position of standing them to defend them, but in the real world. Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers, which is the most important in this situation that has to live, which is the superpower of thinking better. Obviously, there are many more superpowers. And many more tools to think better, but today I want to focus on which I think are less known. What I'm going to tell you are my ideas, I learned them from others. And this is, maybe, the main of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you, that we are able to learn and that our ability to think is not given or is fixed, but that it can be developed. Poting our mind with powerful and practicing ideas. So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. First, imagine they enter a gym. Look at those on the floor, parents, neighbors, daughters, they will be half-volt. They go to the bar, they have a box with milk, with three months of advantages, and they get married. It doesn't work like that, right? Our body doesn't improve with this. Well, compensating happens the same, it doesn't count being able to think, what counts is to think. We have to practice thinking, develop ourselves the habit of thinking and give time to think. Intelligence is not something that has or doesn't have, it's something that is used or not. It's the second. It says the saying that only seeing a mark that, now, who only has a mark, sees all the problems as a plague. But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress. And it's not about their keys. If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing. And if we need to cut something, we need a brain. To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, solve more problems, and if we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model. As if we were trying to get a 2,000 out of a noise with a noise. If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful. But where do these mental models meet in different disciplines, in different places and in different times? For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology, and there are also different mental models in Japan, in Tanzania and Argentina. There are mental models in the old Egypt for 3,000 years before Christ, in the Middle Ages and in our time. To think better we have to expand the box of tools of our heads, but all the problems will seem to be linked. It's the third. Little by little, I was in the club and at the table of the side, a man told his friends about his son and his classmates that had told him about the teacher of his son for a mistake that teacher had committed. Man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher. But it didn't realize it. (Laughter) What? What does this mean? I was creating a much greater evil. In his child. I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends and I was disturbing the teacher in front of all the kids who had to learn. Many times we don't realize that we are focused on winning a scale. It makes us have success in that scale and without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in other most important scale. To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example, money and freedom, or with freedom and losing love. When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do and what is the most important scale in which we have to think how to act. The fourth one. And the principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the zoo. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. And the impression is to have emotions. And emotions make us act. For example, now in the pandemic, many Chinese situations arrived. But those acts didn't have impressions. They generated emotions and they did not act. When they started to reach Italy images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China. These impressions generate emotion, fear, and the fear of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what is moving. This time we were lucky that fear gave us time because someone seemed to us before. But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel. The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. You're hungry, you're hungry. You have an immediate break, eat what to get married. But cultivating is very different: do effort now for something you're going to take advantage of for six months or a year? This is the pillar of almost everything we have. But to come to generate applause, because it's avoiding something that no one is well-being, but saves lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling, that is to develop our ability to anticipate, it's one of the main skills to think well. Let's think a minute. What do we have to anticipate now that we still feel, we live? From now on? We all evaluate things according to our expectations. If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last six months. And we are happy. If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last a month, we're sad, it's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different. If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example. At 49 we are exhausted, if we program to run 20 to kilometers, we are unbearable. But the key to resilience is to handle expectations well. But sex is ultimately. Have you ever met a well-known place? You're walking through a village in the middle of the NASA, a high school classmate who wouldn't do 15 years ago. You can't create an unlikely chance to find it in that place. It's true, finding that classmate in that place is something totally improbable, but, as we know so many people, it's very likely to find someone in a very improbable place, in fact, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of the life is the same: there are so many unlikely things that happen very likely to us. The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis that little of the future, we don't know what will happen. Neither now my field with more normal times, we have to learn to live with the uncertainty. And the best intelligent way to live with uncertainty is to always leave many open doors. Not thinking only in the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible for serious things, even if they are very likely. And if someone ever asks you, why do you always have cars with the stick of birth full? Contestals that, because once you found yourself in a village on the other side of the world, with a secondary classmate you wouldn't see for 15 years. In other words, at first, what I wanted to do with this talk. Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn. And learning has to do with being accepted. To the fact of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking and of people with whom to grow these ideas, to be able to enrich our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others, it's about changing our own ideas. Audience: No. A 40-year-old interview, the interview Domis is a question, and when Borges replied. The interviewed told me, "This same you answered to me." And to that same question four years ago. "Borfies, I don't know what happened." He looked at him and said: "I ask for excuses, I haven't had much time to think about this subject for these four years." Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live to be accepted by new ideas that are emerging and be always open to change our way of thinking. Women are irrational beings, always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodia of a man, which is the rational of the family, at the beginning of their lives. They will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will succeed in a good husband when they will have to take care of. This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for children and young people's education about marriage. Which circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930. But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915, no country in the world, women could vote, in 2015, that is, today, 600 years later, 65 countries are governed by women. In 1910. In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize, it's the only woman who won twice the Nobel Prize. But France's science academic said he didn't have enough merit to be academic. And the first woman in France, who entered the science Academy, was in 1979, 36 years ago, many of you here have already finished the primary. Because university, leaving, has a very prestigious business school. That's been celebrating this in 1925, until now 50 years ago, a woman could be a master's degree. The University of Yale admired women in 1972. The Prince University recently 1974, and we could continue and follow. But this was the idea. That women only serve to create children and help their husband. It's a rational series, it's hystéric. It was a truth made a century ago, they believed in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment, and almost all, taking 5,000, maybe, believed that this idea was a truth made. Why did the world change so much in a century, more, in the last 50 years, when it changed? Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions that we've lived in, only exist interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. That is to say, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world. Two 1500 years ago, Pindar said this in a poem, now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the objective world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we can understand it once. When you say that there is no facts, that only interpretations exist, many people believe that interpretation is a sort of personal delirium. That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. And what is an interpretative mark? What day is it? On September 24th. Does anyone doubt it? What day is it for you? (Laughter) Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because everything we're here is in agreement with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, in the Ebreo, in the Jewish, or any of the 500 calendars, or more than exist. And on September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think, every IT that we put is part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, the cats live without calendar. My dog applies to the chest and who's very lonely at home. (Laughter) "No, by doing some misfortune." I didn't know the time, I knew what I had become. But don't look at the clock. But if human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world? That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree, looked at an apple, it was written the law of gravity, which is genius, but that's how ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution, and the animals he saw, all that had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides... To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print. It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea. The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it. The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born, but it was born in the 19th century. The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same thing with quantum mechanics, and the same thing we've seen in scientific movements, the technological innovation that are increasingly developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts don't exist only interpretations, when we go to the economic field and social changes, the change is revolutionary. And, however, in less than 100 years, the half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost for humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything else than to clean panels. How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity? In other words, errones are monsters. There's an idea we can do it. To follow because it was created a century and a half and that example to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality, up to 1860 there were no homosexuals in the world. You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, the relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, at all times." They were even documented in many species outside the human being, but they had never thought that sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally created. It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of art. Moral Vitorian, one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak. It's stronger than it exists, because the same thing that turns into a catholic church sex when something we want to do doesn't matter to us. (Laughter) You're going to do it, but it's going to give you guilt. (Laughter) Culture is a big social control. (Applause) (Applause) You don't wish the woman of your fellow man. Or the man of your fellow man. (Laughter) It's going to give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it. And then, that is a form of terrible social control, because it dominates us. (Laughter) Surely, on the one hand, you know we can't stop, it's as if they tried to eat us. We can't stop eating, that's why we are all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, the waste was created where everything that was bad in the society of the sexual point of view was put there. And homosexuals during a century were terribly pursued in the whole world. They don't have the right to talk, my right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the Jews, or that the black ones who had left slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves. It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, in some situations today is ideal. But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century. And that's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, this is just about to get up now, in many parts of the world, homosexuals are still condemned. Nothing to be frightened. But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all depressed, take their identity, respect, and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full rights. I have to be just judged, so that women respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a woman, to eat the black, only black, and the same only gay, but if I don't have to take that. Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison. 50 years ago? They have to live alone. I was a homosexual child, I didn't know what a homosexual child was, and I didn't know the homosexual word either, and my colleagues told me, "I agree, we're going to hit you." "Thank you, don't look at me." And I didn't know what it was, nor Gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything, and at the same time I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that my father loved me, looked at me. And I started to feel what would I have done so that it come out like that. What was it like? I had to learn what to do like that, I had to learn to be homosexual. I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. To assume the identity there is. But I had a positive side. I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than others, do everything better than others, not so they wouldn't reject me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. I stopped being a person. And I'm a person, like any other person in the world. With the victory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances and public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings. And it took me 50 years to learn that I'm also a person, I say I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to close the 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity, 20 or 30 years ago, this idea I had. It's something that arises to understand that facts don't exist. Audience: Yes. (Applause) (Laughter) Interpretations. (Applause) There are contradictions and I'm going to say, because in fact, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend me, and now I want to leave my prison and leave my prison, it was so wonderful. Do you think the State is expensive? That's it. Ah, they told me that there is a list of things we need to survive: call the basic canota, which is the idea of living constantly with this channel, Mexico, San Pedro, our community. It contains the things we need to survive, and if better you go to the things we need to explore, but explore is something different: the constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations. Adapting is a long or small moment full of confusion, where a storm falls and everything you know disappears. When everything you do, you've paid for the voices of someone else, you, you're not a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas and, besides all those ghosts that obstacles it, but once you say it, you have a balance and ideas that come towards your speed. Each moment is a combination of energy, each of these ideas looks like a bomb that searches to exterminate, but some of these ideas are rain, and you can choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side, and in part with each one of them, decide to return, to run or run. (Laughter) But learning to accomplish this movement is something complicated: learning to harm your own movement, a class is not bad, with a dance class, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, and that even if life builds music, movements, I believe it. Movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing. Moments that keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be a work of art, but will allow you to review the exact way those stars were seen. That voice, your best friend, will be the first to defend yourself, the first to give you a little look to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first one is in that orilla, that person is your best friend. A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, without that, it's a canasta and I can't survive. What we created in girls' cities. I'm sure that we chose one. (Laughter) I don't have the opportunity to get out of it, I don't have the chance to do it, I can't progress in the way I would like it. That's me. (Laughter) Do you remember that all the time spent it was better? Is this really like that? Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us. To think about this, it's from 2009 when I had to get to high school and Juancho, Franco and Manuel, in these photos that are seeing there, inevitably, I remember my friends of all life. What can I tell you about my friends that I really want, that they are like my brothers, and that they are three capable people who, as they didn't count with the necessary resources to stay in order to study what I liked, stayed here in the city. And go to luck, to the day of today, you can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams. While I am in the door of this photo, the lack of opportunities is also present, my parents, who are workers, made an effort about humans so that I could study what I liked. Because I knew that I didn't know if I stayed here in the city. I could study the other, but probably the future as a person is quite opportunities. Have you ever wondered why these things happen? And we live in full 21st century, in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization. In which successes and advances are due to a speed that surprise us all and deprives the borders and the barriers that insist between people. And in this context? And cities, to make more and more important cities, are our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. It is estimated that in 2058% of the world's population will live in a city. Because if that number doesn't sound to you, it would have to be almost 10 people around the world. Seven out of every day. If there are more people, they choose to live in cities, they want to say that I have the greatest chance to progress. What do you explain then that while the city norms look like in time, others progress, they are vibrant, everyone wants to visit and everyone wants to live in them? I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to go to the cow when you get out of that door to return home, this is strategy. If we want globalization to help us to bring more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. Part of my concern, as a professional future, in the field of international relationships, happens precisely for this: by connecting cities and trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. (Laughter) How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life? Through concrete projects that improve the quality of life of the population, migration reaches other places in search of a better future. Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends. This is a picture a few months ago, which we add a fifth friend to the group, and that's how you avoid getting a couple of things to start, drinking something from the case. (Laughter) Secondly, as we say that it's a kind of reaction of proportional relationships, some of us have a couple of threads, as we compat, until today, beyond the depths we have of the gold with us, the lack of opportunities. Franco, for example, is the one that is also made in these photos. It was a national champion of geography units in 2012. A national champion. (Laughter) But today, although it's left to publish a school teacher, it doesn't have time because it has to be some students working to be able to live. (Laughter) Then you're ugly, you think my left is below, that I like to go to his audience. (Laughter) So, when I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to enter one of the security for the country, as I didn't count with that possibility here, I started changing this network without finding what was really impaired. (Laughter) But all the day working in their local genius, which is a genius of illustration, but they don't know the genius, they see any thing, but they all tell you that it's a genius that built from nothing itself. It's going to college to study programming, because they can't study their potential and learn what they like, and they can't develop their potential and learn what they like for lack of presupport to their biodiversity. Time studies programming, and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study. The worst of all this I'm telling you. It's that we, as young people, don't have anything that makes us less than the rest of the world, we have absolutely nothing. Right? Recently, I had the huge fortune of being elected between a group of 8 young children at a worldwide level, I left the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentinean in that event to participate in a week in New Day and the capital of India. Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back. I learned a lot, but if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following. First, there are millions of opportunities out there, but there are millions of opportunities out there for all tastes and for all values. But there are discourse found, they don't come alone. But not less important, do you know what differentiates them, that we don't have, we don't have one to guide the kids, the children, the linear, our human resources as Argentines are brilliant and in one or two, we don't have one to guide them to develop? (Laughter) Another time we want better cities, we know strategically the world. I don't remember. When I arrived for the first time in Rosario that I could study, with three days to fulfill 18 years, I was a bit scared, with a lot of fear. This can never find this in public because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult to leave your city, to play, to leave a piece of your heart, it's like leaving a piece of today I feel like that, six years went by. (Laughter) I went to the voice with friends, toys? And nobody you know is necessary to give them tools to our young people so they stay in their cities and can grow from there. In the end, what's more beautiful than giving wings to the city you had to do. And with a strategy, what can we do? Imagine the brilliant who would have been white. If I could dedicate myself completely to geography. Or how much, if today they were in one of the security courses in our country? Or to not go so far away, Emanuel, if I had the necessary programs to continue adding what I like. Is it like that? "Wow, yeah!" That's how the opportunity is shown. For themselves, all this. What am I telling you? It doesn't look like enough arguments and want a more example. "Look." I'm fine. [A.DE.] That tattoo that tells me, when, finally, I was able to overcome the deep pressure of mine in which I fell because I had to go to the edition. After two suicide methods. They are countless, psychological sequels. And he told me everything. A lot, a lot to overcome. If we want these things to stop passing, we have to go out strategically. Please, we don't take a final point in our city. Audience: Yes. I'm a surgeon. Well, from always the surgeons. We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. Well, in my last 10 years. I have my research. In my case in the zoo, the reasons were based on looking for more and less patients. That can be done in several ways, for example, looking for genes to detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair themselves by themselves. We are using their own ability to regenerate. We do it with biological platforms that are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own ability to restore after a damage. And finally, with new technologies. We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures and preserve organs where before we had to operate and take them out. In other words, robotics is giving us a lot of tools. To facilitate this task. What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge. My own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate. It gave me many satisfactions. And even a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized that developing goals, increasingly less invasive, I have more and more work. I'd like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. I'm not a doctor, my mother is a Japanese, and also in my work of many years, I've had contact with sociological and anthropological issues of Japanese culture. And I believe that certain behaviors and answers, social and individuals, can help us when facing a crisis like this one. It's worth asking us a first question. Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage? And if in January the first case came. I'm so close to the neighbour. Having almost 130 million inhabitants in very reduced space. Keeping the populations of the third age, older people in the world. Being in the second country with more fumers for the amount of inhabitants. Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth? but a linear and identified advance. BB: Until now. We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious, in these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease. Basically, many people, in little place, and a room of those people with more than 65. What happens then? The Japanese is a society that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it. Japan went through wars. "You're hungry, your name." Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year, 1,000 temblors per day. Generation between generation has had to overcome natural disasters caused by men. This is what we can think with something that likes the Argentines a lot: football teams, like example. What football team will make better performance before a critical moment? The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do. Or the team that has never entered, that has no infrastructure and has to go out to improvise. The directives of social distancing, hygiene and individual behavior. Be in society or in your own house. The Japanese population has established it for hundreds of years, doesn't have to embrace, not give beers, because they don't do it. It greets with a reverence. Daring distance is a gesture of respect and most workers in public places use a lot. It's not necessary to recommend, to take out the shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used. In fact, Asian studies show that more than 50% of Japanese don't have to indicate, it's not to sleep or to be on another person, because this is a usual protocol between the Japanese, they will use barbies to feel reflected. Not to protect yourself, but to protect others. Here is the fundamental message of a collective culture. Thank you. The good of everything is more important than the good of a part. (Audience) Yes! To illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience. They made two Western teachers in a school in Japan. I will surely know the game of the chair. You put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants, and you get rid of each round. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, were all following the place to a classmate. Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers. The word Japanese loves this way of being, it's about having confidence that the other will take care of me. In resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others. In the example, there is a child. But we can already see how a collective society works. (Laughter) It helps itself, because each album contributes to the environment.
