(Music) (Applause) I have a message for their children and grandchildren. And I need you to help me swimming. It's very simple. (Applause) We need to learn to feel. To think and act in sustainable harmony with nature. A few years ago, when I found myself diving in the Lombocan Rights, in Indonesia. At 30 meters below water, with that feeling of engravity, surrounded by a great biodiversity of recipes, corals, tortures, mold fish. And from all colors, I had an intense feeling of being connected with nature. It was a very profound mystical and spiritual experience. So, at that moment, I observed as a small fish, from foreigns. Negers and yellow came out of a fish bank and it was just in front of me. We were looking at each other. And I realized that our consciences were telepatically communicated. Yes, yes, the fish had recognized me, I was talking to myself. It was a very spiritual feeling, and that's what you're thinking, this teacher is crazy, he talks to fish, right? It's the same thing my students think in the university, every time I tell you, look at each other. And they say: "Google, the teacher is crazy, but I'm not crazy." (Laughter) And for that, I bring a scientific test of the globe, which is an artist. B.G: The 24-hour work, during a week, to draw that art work we're going to see, that mandate we see or the opposite, the maritime stream we're going to see. It proves that nature has awareness. And that I'm not crazy. What if I'm able to talk to fish? Is it true that the indigenous peoples can talk to birds or plants, with rocks, with mountains and with other natural phenomena? I think so. In fact, I bring you more scientific evidence: last year the Science magazine published a study where 2000 percent ecosystems of indulous diversity were analyzed. Scientists said that there is a mathematical pattern of 3/4 companies and predators, that is, for every four bottles there were three lions. Or, on the contrary, it wouldn't be sustainable, right? In other words, paradoxically, from amazing forms to this same mathematical pattern, our organic physiology is reproduced. (End of video) I agree with the law of Cleber. A elephant who has a thousand times higher than a mouse doesn't need to eat 1,000 times more than the mouse. But three rooms. And if you stop thinking about it, the planet we live in is made of three quarters of water, right? So I ask myself: Is it a meracuincidence? Or does nature really have an inherent consciousness? After thousands and thousands of years of intersystemic coevolution. That was the problem that led me to study the great story of my PhD research. That is to say, all those science that integrate and unify. The history of the universe, the history of the planet Earth, the history of life and the human being, I realized that nature has principle and strategies that we must imitate and perfect to achieve a sustainable development. And I remember, with the scientific consensus, with the explosion of the Big Bang, the Universe emerged to 13,700 million years ago, the planet Earth was formed between 4,000 500 and 5,000 million years, and during the first half of this period, the formed in very simple levels. Thanks to the fossil remains found to the date, it's known that autrodopitics have a few million years ago that the human being has been adapting the environment in about 250 million years, and especially from the agricultural revolution that domesticated animals and plants to a very simple energy, which has been developed in the current form. But the socioeconomic system imposed by neoliberal globalization has revealed. It's like something unbearable. It doesn't happen in three species. In a 30-year-old Parliament or maybe 100 million species? A single species, united or more, is destroying the processes of co-volution of the rest of species, and that, if it's crazy, and we are all responsible. (Laughter) Life is a cosmic miracle that we must preserve and preserve all costs. But the human being keeps wanting to destroy everything around him. Well, from the midst of the 20th century, and the first time in the history of humanity, human beings have the technological and nuclear potential to destroy everything around them. Well, if it seems we've forgotten from Hirosima and Nagasaki, we've already built the hydrogen bomb, which is 100 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb. To give you an idea, equivalent to the thermal fusion of stars that can reach 65 million degrees. And that's why, little by little, future generations are also threatened by the ecological fingerprint we leave in the breastfeeding, our mother Earth. Since half the 90s, the human being has overcome the limits of biophysical regeneration of the Earth. (Applause) Since 1990, until 2020, we will lose 40% of the planetary biodiversity. According to the World Forum of Nature. If all of us, all the citizenship of the world, imitate the models and lifestyles that are in the United States, we would need four planets like ours. But we don't have four planets, right? That's why it's urgent that we learn to cooperate and learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature. Besides, the use of fossil fuels, like oil, gas and carbon, has created a big global warming, and what does this mean? Imagine that we will be the doors and the windows of this theater. And we take fire to the bottles in which you are sitting. Yes, imagine it. You already know the barbarian, that's the stage we're leaving our children and grandchildren. A chronic scenario of natural resources, Darwin told us that they will only survive the strongest, those who better adapt to the environment, but he forgot to define the concept of cooperation. So, if it's true that there is violence and predation and excess, in any way. In life, in nature, what defines it. It's not competence, but cooperation, I'll give you an example: Imagine millions of spermatozoids running, fighting, competing to reach an egg to fertilize it. What defines life is not a competition, but a symbiotic union has a spermatozoid and a novel between two different entities that create a new one. That defines life, cooperation. The football, for example, we all know that a team competes against another, but what we don't realize is that what defines the victory of a team is the ability to cooperate between 11 players along with the technical body behind it. Our body is a plural cell phone organism where millions of cells cooperate to do what we are. And paradoxically, nature is the best model to imitate and perfect, to reach sustainable societies, but the human being keeps creating ideology of linear thinking after 3800 million years of co-evolution, nature knows what works and what is lost in time has suffered catástrofes, of meteorites, and constant processes of trial and error. Doctrina is political, like the anarchism that failed the communism that also failed socialism, failed, and capitalism has also failed, has more money than the rest of 99. That's if it's crazy, and that's the message I have for their children and grandchildren. (Laughter) That they don't adapt to this socioeconomic system that is ill, pathologically, and that it's psychopathic, because nature is signed to obtain economic benefits, we've sent to the bottom of the sea. The money has colonized life. And that's why it's fundamental that we learn to feel, to think and act in harmony with nature, biomimetics is a new science that imits nature to solve human problems. I see life, my my mythical imitation, imitation of life, but this is not new, this is already doing it in the originary villages, the indigenous people, of thousands of years ago. And it's something inside us, we all have that faculty, and I invite you to play a game. Imagine what happens to you with this veruga: How could the engineers, architects, economists, inspire us? Well, for them a plane came up. What would happen to them with the peak of the "Pajaro Martín Bolador"? Well, the Japanese did the train "Vala." And with this Murciélago? We could make a trunk, right? (Laughter) And with this laboratory ardilla. We could learn to fly. With termites. We could make bioclimatic buildings. With this Girasol. A plant of solar boards. As we know, there are millions of species in nature. Bio-inspiration is practically infinite. But do we keep thinking that nature ... It will be there forever. Many economists tell us that we have to manufacture and build and overcome the cognitive false of the GDP, what does the GDP mean? To climb so much percent of economy every year. But that means going to nature and murder it to bring raw material. For the industry. We have to be aware that the world we live in is not a gift of our parents, but a president of our children and grandchildren, and what will they think if we don't do everything that is in our reach to change the consequences of a climate change that has already started? Can you imagine? A future to dialogue with their children and grandchildren. I would like you to tell me, "Daddy." At least you try it, fight. And you. What would you like to hear? Thank you very much (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) What I want to tell you is that the quarantine has our opportunity and the pandemic is not a problem, they are terrible things, we spoke about it all we need. But it has many complicated opportunities, politically. With my moment. We're wrong, socially with good, we're going to our friends. This doesn't happen at all, it doesn't matter what to think, it's an opportunity that we have to take advantage of and that it's a great moment to learn, it's a big moment for anything, it's a horrible moment. In fact, life is not about something else, that happens horrible moments and learning from them: we learn pain, disease. If we do it, if we go to that direction, we take it from war, we die of death. I don't know what. That's what we're going to do now. And what I've already had, I only have to enter. It's an idea in which I was meditating, from a book. It's called "The Modern Athroeza," that the film is "The Rexarmon." They are the newspapers that Germán arrived in the 80s, returning to his childhood to the gardenery, three exams is a kid who, in fact, when diagnosed with HIV diagnosis. They are a lot of movies, very important questions, some of the most important ones in their career. But what he decides is that he's going to buy a land in a horrible place. It was going to take care of a garden. And what was impressive. It's terrible, as a person. It's that for him, taking care of a garden wasn't doing time. It wasn't, well, passing the route. Not like now that we spend the time cooking, making bread or whatever. Or cleaning and we think, "Well, even if it's the only thing we do is to see dishes, not the only tasks that are promised are those." And they thought then about the reproductive work concept, which is a concept that comes out of sexism. From Figengers, basically. And that, more specifically, the feminist weapon. To talk about reproductive work, it's not even the productive work that is the one that puts new things in the world, we can say, that is, "Well, Mr. Padio, Claudio, doesn't matter," and this is the reproductive work that reproduces the conditions so we can do that, clean, cook, care, right? Thank you very much. I had to cook the workers for the next day to put the factory, their reproductive work. And feminists take a lot of time, right? By increasing, correctly, that reproductive work is also work. But in general, what we do, what we ask, is that reproductive work has economic value because it is useful to do productive work, because if work doesn't eat it in the factory. Now, why the fat of thinking about that relative value, first, we don't think of an absolute value? It's even more, why don't we do it as a rejection and think that difference is contrast? Between productive and reproductive work, is a more infective difference given by one side? Of course, gender, there are areas that are important, these are the productions, traditionally internalized by gold. And the reproductive reproductive remains the mentality for the women are important, and it's also given by modernity and the idea of taking care of the subject. It's something that doesn't make you special, you're not originating, you're an artist, you don't make you think, you don't make you an important person, right? These are values we don't have to accumulate. Let's think it's the opposite, even the care tasks are the most important, are these days? We are living without advertising, without writers. But the world didn't go spinning without PowerPoint and the world keeps spinning, but the world didn't go spinning without food and without care. Without nurses and no health. The only thing that allows us today? Is it to eat? It's cool. What a beautiful thing? And without that, the world magic. That's it. Those tasks... They have a value that is not relative, they have absolute value. And not only that, but what? It's not just something mechanical that we have to go through the river, that hope it won't exist, pick it up, make it like that, clean it almost, cook, not only see the food. We can think about it like this, we have thought it for a long time. But what I thought when I read to Germans is that... Just as well, to live them in a different way. Can we live them? Like tasks that have a wisdom, like tasks in which. We are involved as human beings, that are not mechanical, and that also has to do with thinking precisely in what the title is not modern nature, modernity. Human beings have separated from the natural world. Only do something interesting with nature when it turns it into something else, but also the relationship of care with nature. It's also something interesting. The lesson of care with our bodies, we think that there's someone to take care of the body, there's the gym or cook. Just to be healthy, to do other things, things that matter. He looked at me. This is also a very strange way to think about our relationship with our own body, not to think that our mind is what we are. And that the body will do something we have to overcome. I don't think so. This is an opportunity. And, in fact, I want to return to my life. No, the world doesn't need more novels and I want to write novels the same, that's how life is. No, we all live in this contradiction and life for absurdity. Now. I give you the world, you need more novels. I thought, "Well. Why not? Instead of obsessed with being productive in these days. And to know all the colds and with all that, why not think about connecting with the world, with the careers, with others, in another way, from that? That's why, in fact, when they invited me to do this, I don't know, because it seemed to me that I didn't have to belong to an original idea, the world didn't decide another novel and the world didn't need any other idea. But that's why I thought about taking care of what I had with my books and that maybe I'd tell other people, right? More than writing, reading? And more, what to do? Remember. Thank you very much (Applause) People, when they go to the diet, the first thing they think is what they won't eat. No more bread, no more sweet, no more posters, no more 15 days. A end of the middle. These foods don't fat. What matters is the dismissioned and disordened way we consume them. That's why I want to name you. Three key aspects. To have a good food. The first is consciousness. Well, once a teacher told me: "The consciousness is secondary to the brain activity." And with brain activity, losing experts on the subject, I mean our unconscious, our desires, our beliefs. So, if the consciousness rate is secondary to our desires? We would never choose a food we wanted to eat. But on the contrary, the one that doesn't like the most. And after this, are we aware of what we are feeding, what are we eating? And in which quantity? A good fact is not to go to the super with hunger. Because when we have a man, it's not a man of a man. Zamber of everything, Zambre Borasi, the most caloric. And desire becomes unmobile to that, or to those foods we wanted to eat. I've always prohibited it, it has been the most attentive, right? The one who makes diet and restricts fast food is constantly thinking of pixas. To see, dream, grandmother, a fuel with double wealth. Thank you very much. So ... Going back to the subject. Are we really capable? That is, pizza. Thank you very much, I prefer a Wardolph. Impossible, right? The second aspect is the practice: to eat, like every process in life, you learn. And in this case, and in many cases. That my include reains to learn. (Laughter) We must learn to eat in station. What does this mean? Let's see, eating the food that have been harassed at that time. This will guarantee us a control and a balance in our weight and putting a god in our health. (Laughter) Because foods are made of their own, of their time. They are the most natural foods. They are the richest foods in nutrients and they are not chemically treated to subsist in time. In other words, they are not additioned with calories. And necessary for our body. Or is it normal to see fruit all year, or is it normal to drink tomatoes in winter and summer? So this mechanism has led to practice. It will guarantee us, it will guarantee us a consumption of quality and variety where we won't fall in the monotony of always eating the same. The last aspect? For me, it's not smaller, but it's from the most important ones in moderation. (Audience) Yes. Those who don't disagree, because they don't have hunger, because they don't have time, because many times they give them anxieties. And I have a question. They also give them anxieties. Repeting the plate of purchasing with frites? To think, right? (Laughter) What do I want to say with this, that hunger accumulates? That hunger is not handling. Yes, they are restricted in food if they get out of food. What is not consumed in the day is consumed in the afternoon or night and in double portion. To be the graphicest is like a snowball that comes from the top. Every time with more size, every time with more volume. And every time with more strength. So, if we don't stop each three. Four hours. To take a collection. That snowball will unfold in a boring way. In the first moment we have the opportunity to eat. And we're going to disappoint all the food around us. (Audience) Yes! To go over. Together with this, I want to dismantle the false belief that says that the more hours we spend without eating, the more jokes I'm going to do, the weight I'm going to lose and not. In other words, the most expart body becomes to reserve. And I said, "Look. And when I mean reserving, I mean this, I mean this, and everything we want to eliminate from our body. Let's go. The food doesn't only make you fat. Let's leave, please, of that ignorance. The food can hurt you or cure you, it depends on us, to be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and in what amount. I return to moderation. That's how the phrase that must know it, drink with moderation, should exist a coma with moderation. This food stimulates overweight. (Applause) To give it a closet. I propose you to eat rich, to eat everything you like. Being varied, but always taking care of the portion. And not for anything there is the phrase "Desajuna como Rei," "They die as a prince" and "sene" as I said. I think many of us know it. (Laughter) The health has excuses: "Oh, I can't, I don't have, I'm there." It happened to me the hunger, or even worse, when I died of hunger. We have four opportunities a day to choose how to take care of and feed healthyly. Thank you very much (Applause) (Music) (Applause) As soon as I'm obsessed by telling stories of research, but there are many others who didn't get to a Nobel Prize, but they did incredible things recently, I entered the history of Ugeneas Ardote, Ugenia was an Italian doctor who migrated to Argentina in the time of the second war. (Applause) I found her very little, a lot of bronca, that's why I tell stories of scientific women, they gave us an idea to the bronca that she gave me to see me in front of them, but above all, to not lose those who are, thank you. (Applause) How did I lose her? (Music) (Applause) We lost a lot of time in school learning ortography. Kids keep losing a lot of time in school with ortography. That's why I want to share with you a question. Do we need a new ortography? I think yes, it's necessary or better, I think we need to simplify what we already have. And the question and the answer are new in our language, they come to bounce back in the century for a long time, since in 1492, in the first grammar of the Castellan language. Antonio de Nebrijas felt for our ortography a clear and simple principle. That's how we have to describe how we pronounce and pronounce how we write. Each sound should correspond to a lyrics, each lyrics should represent a single sound and those who didn't represent any sound should eliminate themselves. This criteria, the phonetic criteria, which says that we have to write, according to pronounce, is and it's not based on ortography, as we practice it today. Because when in the 18th century we decided how we were going to uniform our writing, it's because the Spanish, unlike other languages such as English or French, was always a strong resistance to writing too different from how we pronounced. There was another criteria that guided a good part of the decisions, that other criteria was etymological. The one who says we have to write, according to how words were written in their original language, in Latin, in Greek, and that's how we stay with long and short acts that, unlike what many people never believed in the pronouncement of the Spanish. That's how we create congeses, that sometimes sound as "aspers" as in people, and sometimes they sound soft, like a fool, so we stay with thesis, heces. There are three letters that some places correspond to a sound and in others to two, but none to three. I'm not here to tell you anything that you don't know for your own experience. We all went to school, we all invested large quantities of time of learning, large quantities of that time of plastic and infant brain, indicated. In the memorization of ortographic rules full, however, of exceptions. They brought us in many simplic and explicit ways, the idea that in ortography something was fundamental in our training. However, I have the feeling that teachers didn't ask why it was so important, they even asked a previous question: What was the function that the ortography fulfilled? What is ortography good for? And the truth is that when you ask that question, the answer is much simpler and less transcendental than it usually believes. Ortography is used to uniform writing. so that we all write the same and, therefore, it's not easier to understand when we read it. But in contraposition with other aspects of language, like punctuation, for example, in ortography there is no individual and involved ability. In punctuation, yes. With punctuation, I can choose to change the sense to a phrase, with punctuation, I can print a particular rhythm to what I'm writing with ortography, no. With ortography, or it's good or it's bad, according to you or not to be adjusted to the old norms. But then it wouldn't be easier to simplify the oldest norms so that it would be easier to teach, learn and use the ortography correctly. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the smart norms so that all that time we dedicate them to the teaching of ortography? We can dedicate it to other issues of language whose complexity, yes, they deserve time and effort. What I propose is not to abolish ortography, it's not that each one writes as they want. The language is a common use tool, and therefore it seems fundamental to me that we use it following common criteria. But it also seems fundamental that those common criteria are the simplest thing that can be done. Especially, because if we simplify our ortography, we are not leveling down when ortography is simplified, it doesn't feel the quality of language at all. I work every day with the literature of the Ourolego, Garcillazo, Airvantes, Agongora, Quevedo, that sometimes they write: "Men, signs, sometimes they write, write, with a decoration." And it's absolutely clear that the difference between these texts and ours is of convention or lack of convention in their time, but not of quality. But let me return to teachers because they are key characters in this story, I mentioned that insistence a little irreflexive with which teachers hurt us and hurt us with ortography. In our society, ortography works as a privileged index that allows to distinguish the culto of the brutal, the education of the ignorant, regardless of the content you're writing, you can get or stop getting a job by an H. You can become an object of public bubble for a misunderstanding bird. So, in that context, of course, it makes sense to dedicate all that time to ortography. But we shouldn't forget. Throughout the history of our language, there were always teachers or linked individuals with the teaching of the first letters, those who pushed portography, sometimes there was a obstacle for the transmission of knowledge. In our case, for example, Sarmiento, along with Andrés Bello, pushed the greatest ortographic renovation that has indeed had place in Spanish language, which was the Chile of media. In the 19th century. Because then, I'm going to take the position of those teachers and start moving forward in our ortography, I'm here, in the intimacy of us 10,000, I'd like to put on the table some modifications that seem reasonable to start discussing. Let's eliminate HMUDA, where we wrote an H. We chose one, we can be anybody, we can discuss, sit down, each one will be able to argument, we don't have one, we eliminate the other: "Geeeeee, let's divide the functions of sentimental attachment, it can justify for someone, but we don't pronounce anything, we don't pronounce anything, we can't write anything, we can't write anything, we can't write anything." Garave, giraffe, people. Argentine. And I know, that Iceta is an interesting case, because it shows that the phonetic criteria must be a guide, but it can't be an absolute principle, in some cases, the difference of pronouncement must be attended, now I said before, it's made in some places that correspond to a sound in other two and three letters, we go down to two. We're all better: some of these changes may seem a little dramatic, they're not so much the real Academy, all the academics of language also believe that ortography must be modified. That language is linked to history, traditions and customs, but it's also a practical tool of daily use, and that sometimes that attachment to history, traditions and customs are transformed into an obstacle. And for today's use, that explains that our language is much more. That the ones we know, that we have geographically close, were modifying historically in us, for example, we went from ortography to ortography, we went from theater to theater, we went from quantity, we went from symbol to symbol, and, little by little, now they start to remove themselves, harmony, they can write with H or synacy. And we're all fine. Does it look like me? This is a particularly appropriate moment to face this discussion. It always tells us that language changes spontaneously from below to above, which are the users who incorporate new words, those who introduce gramatic modifications. And that authority, in some places, is a academic in other places, is a dictionary, in other places, is a ministry, a long time later, accepts them and incorporates them. This is true only for some levels of language, it's true for the level of ortography that has always historically changed from above to down, there were always the institutions that fixed the norms. And they proposed modifications. Why do I say that this is a particularly appropriate moment, until today, writing has always had a much more restricted and private use it speaks? (Laughter) But at our time, the time of social networks. This is suffering a revolutionary change. It's never been described as much as now, and in those social networks, for the first time, we're seeing a large school using novelous ortographic use. where even impecable ortography people, hyper-educated, when they write in social networks. It behaves quite similar to how the majority of the users of social networks behave, that is, they relax the ortographic correction and priorize speed and effectiveness in communication, for now. There are chaotic, individual users, but it seems to me that we have to pay attention, because probably they are telling us that a time that signs writing to a new place is asking for that writing, new criteria, I think we would be wrong to reject them. To discharge them because we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decadence of our time, I don't think we have to observe them, order them and encourage them inside a more affinement with the needs of our times. Audience: Yes. I can anticipate some objections. Now, those who say that if we simplify ortography, we will lose etymology. In rigor, if we wanted to preserve etymology, it wouldn't be enough with ortography, we should also learn Latin, Greek, Arabic. With a simplified ortography, we are going to recover etymology at the same place where we are going now, to the etymological dictionary. A second operation of those who say, "If we simplify ortography, we will stop distinguising between these words that today are different in only one lyrics, that's true, but it's not a problem, our language has the bench where we deposit the money, the suit that we don't confuse them in any confusion." But there's a third objection. For me? The most comprehensible, even the most moving, which is the one they say, "I don't want to change," "I educate myself like this," "I get used in this way when I read a word written in ortography, simplified, "I hurt my eyes." (Laughter) That objection is within each one of us. What do I think we have to do to do as we always do in these cases, changes are done in front of the kids, new norms are taught to those we don't want, let us write how we are used to? And it is expected that time feels the new norms. The success of all ortographic renovation that touches so arraigated habits is in the prudence, consensus, gradualism and tolerance. But we can't let the rule, the old customs, encourage us to move forward. The best tribute we can agree with, that the academics have to agree and clean our ortography, the best tribute we have to put in the past is to improve what we receive. All those habits we use because we receive them even if they don't help us. I'm convinced that if we do that in the modest environment, but very important of language, we'll be leaving them to the next generations a future. Better ... (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Before my father died, I remember looking at him closely in the eyes. I had the eyes coffee with a joy around the Liris. And saying to myself, don't forget your eyes. After his death, reality didn't make sense, I had to understand life and death. Well, maybe for my training as a photographer. Instinctively, just like when they give us, I felt the need to look at their seeds at the microscope. For the surprise of all scientists I approached with monocromatic images. The discovery I made transformed my view of the world. The whole universe inside my mind. It was like being floating in the universe. It was like being that space. A space that is tangible, without body. It was absolute content. It became peace. This image. Do you see it? This is the image of the seeds of my microscope father. And this other is someone else's brother, and that's how you could teach them infinite. All my fear and my sadness disappeared. I didn't feel disconnection from anything or anyone. His death, more than a film, represented the beginning of what today is the project of my life. Now let's see the project. For me, this is teaching. That our most pure material essence ... We are scared by the cosmos. And that when we look at the mirror, there are perhaps in that reflection, infinitely more than we believe in. And that matter is not created nor destroyed. It becomes more of a divine action than a thermodynamic principle. Thank you (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) In Argentina, the INBAP is a society that develops atomic energy. And space technology. His satellites travel around the planet, it's the best example, maybe we have of the capacity the state of innovating. We shouldn't create an invasion of education. Imagine a public agency that designs content and strategies to transform learning. That I work with schools to rewrite what classrooms happen. That develops the research of border to use, for example, artificial intelligence in a large scale. Many of you: an agency with pedagogists, designers, scientists, data scientists, artists, philosophers. For this to be possible, it should be blind of the political logics of short-term. They should reach the maximum specialists and develop a culture, a mystic of innovation in public management. The first step is to think of the state as a possibility. Not like the variable of all the adjusts. Just like that, changes in education will not benefit the most advantages... (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I'm a scientist and years ago I do experiments to try to understand human behavior. And many times, on this path, cinema or literature have been the only way to imagine how we would react in front of extraordinary situations. From big loves, extraterrestrial invasions. Until pandemic. Until the fiction made reality. And here and now, at home, we don't stop asking ourselves questions. From the most extraordinary corners of the human condition to the most ridiculous and the most worldwide. For example, the world's obsession would buy mountains of hygiene paper. It turns out that this behavior that seems and is ridiculous. KA: Who is a unconscious biological? In this case, focus is more exposed to the intensity that belongs to the answer. It's a bit like the soccerist who runs desperately a ball to whom he really knows he won't arrive. And the failure lives with more relief if we know we had made a great effort to try to remedy it. It's also very unique to humans trying to look for explanations to what happens to us. In this case, the Chinese government, in only 10 days, had not only found the virus that produced the disease, but that had sequenced its genome and had done it public. And this would have given a great advantage of time to the rest of us of not being for another principle of human psychology, called optimistic blind. The same thing happens is that many of us drive or drive while we speak on the phone or worse, while we send messages. Thinking that, in fact, won't happen to us anything? It made the great politicians of Europe and many other parts of the world lose a great opportunity to act in time. But many times the answers we look for are not biological or medical, but more social morals. Why does this happen to us now? And, unfortunately, almost always these questions end up incompatible or stigmas. For example, in the Bubónica, the Jews in Europe and the Chinese in San Francisco, in the United States, when, in fact, this made people lose an opportunity to see that the city had become a cemetery of rats, which were the ones who were really propagating the disease. In this pandemic, like many others, the maskets are useful, above all, to prevent people who are already sick with other people. However, Japan has shown that everyone uses more chairs. This first makes people who are healthy and don't count and this is very important, but there's another most important reason: if they don't use maskets, we get sick. So this would be a sort of accusatory excuse, to know who is sick and who doesn't because they use no more squares. That they use it all over the world, it's a way of avoiding self-esteem. We have to take care of everyone. Perhaps, what we've discovered the most in these days is our extraordinary capacity for change. In general, we think that we persist in our traditions, in our habits, in our visits, because it's impossible to change, but it's true, it's something that really lacks motivation to do it. This is what we have discovered now, for years we think that education couldn't change and that it was those things that were extremely difficult to change it. And, however, in three days, all children educate themselves at home. We don't know some consequences of this. But we learned that we are willing to do it is the need for awareness, and the world keeps moving. Also, of course, they change our values, our judgment. It was only two or three months ago when the pandemic started. The Western people looked at China with accusatory eyes for their predisposition to restrict individual liberties, to confine people at home. Today, what seemed horrible then. That everyone has to stay at home, it completely seems priority. And if on this idea, how can our principles change and how we can go adjusting them, I would like to be a small mental experiment? It's a dilemma, a caricature for us to think about the future. Imagine the next situation. We are at the beginning of the pandemic. A public consensus that includes the Organization of the Salud. But also Government and other public sectors have the capacity, through some technology, to know where we are, where we move. And also data of our body intimacy. Our temperature, our respiratory frequency, maybe our viral load. And you can use that information to know who is infected or who is in risk of infecting and who. Let's suppose that this consortion can use this information to restore the movement of people in a specific way, the one who is at home, the one who is at risk, can go out. And we keep this mental experiment imagining that with this we really keep the effect of epidemic. It doesn't disappear completely, but it moves much less people and we can do it in a way where we don't have to stop the economy and the world in the way we have done it. Finally, we think that all the conspirative reasons why, in general, we don't want to see our data, the risk they make a misunderstanding keeps being true, there's nothing free. The question is: if you were at the beginning of the pandemic and you could choose if it looks good or bad to do this? What would you do? I chose this dilemma because I think it's good for the inevitable attention there is. On the one hand, privacy and individual freedom, which are fundamental values of our culture. On the other hand, collective solutions are necessary and the most efficient to solve pandemics. Maybe we see our data a little like vaccinating us. It's a succession that we make of one of our many liberties as part of a social impact. To take care of us. And everyone. A while ago, with the Chile, a luck leaves freedom, in this case, sexual freedom. We found a good solution of commitment. Compreservative sex. When all this happens, what will the balance we want to get to feel free and care? Are you going to fly less airplanes in a sky? Will we change the way we greet? Are we going to be part of our treatment as a public good to take care of everyone? We don't know it, but locked at home we have an opportunity to think freely than ever. We want it to be the preservative sex of the coronavirus. (Applause) (Music) (Applause) My first encounter with a fossil. It was when I was 12 years old, in a trip we did with my family at the province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, Argentina. I had been many times in museums, with full of dinosaurs that fascinated me. But this was the first time I saw a fossil in the field, in the middle of nowhere. An animal that had lived millions of years ago and that probably nobody had seen before. (Sounds) The animal I found was similar to this, as a mind, we call it "dolars of sea," are relatives from sea airplanes. And they were very common in the seas that invaded Patagonia for about 15 million years. So, at that moment... I didn't know all this, I didn't know what it was, and immediately I tried to take it out. And I discovered something about the fossil that I didn't know. They are extremely fragile: the sea dollar broke down the sand. And I saw that my paleontologist career had started in the worst way. But I'm interested in fossil fuels or fascination by these beings of the past, to imagine how our planet had been in the past. They followed me captivating and took me to study dinosaurs and animals that lived millions of years ago in a remote past of our planet. About 100 million years ago. Our planet was very different as the one today, it was so different that not only humans didn't exist, but the whole planet was dominated. For dinosaurs and other raptile groups. And I told you 100 million years ago. It's a quantity that we, paleontologists, mentioned daily, but it's very difficult to conceptualize. If you look here, there will be 10,000 people in this stadium, which is many people. Well, imagine that each one of you represents a stadium like these of 10,000 people. 10,000, for 10,000, these are 100 million, that's a amount. That it doesn't enter the head. And that multiplied by a year of duration, think of what happened in all its last years of life. It's a amount of time that is really very, very difficult for us to enter. In your head. But well, life led me to study how the world was 100 million years ago. I've traveled for deserts and fossil studies of different parts of the planet to try to deny how the past of our planet was in different regions, places like Mongolia, the south of China, South Africa. I'm studying fantastic fossils, but it has also led me. A very special place. What is Patagonia and when we say Patagonia? Naturally, we think of these landscapes, forests, lakes, close to the crop of the Andes. But for us, paleontologists, Patagonia is this: it's a great wonderful and full of fossils. What do they want to be discovered? We fortunately know many dinosaurs of Patagonia, one of the best places in the world to look for dinosaurs, and the great majority of the dinosaurs we know of Patagonia is the last period in which dinosaurs live in Earth. What we call critical period, this is about 70 million years ago, we know many fossils of Patagonia, and, for example, we know that in the South hemisphere. The dominant carnivores, the most common channels belonged to a family called Velisáurios. While, at that time, in the northern hemisphere, other carnivores gathered, like the dinosaurs, for example. Where the famous Tyrannosaurus rex belongs, and this difference between the north of the South wasn't surprising because at that time a big ocean divided and separated isolated the continents of the North hemisphere. But what happened before this stage we know well, in what we call "jurassic period," 100 million years earlier? At that time, all continents were united in a great super continent called Pangea. And we know very little about what happened in this time, in the Kurassic, in the south hemisphere. And it's a key moment to understand the evolution of dinosaurs in our planet. Her key man, especially 170 million years ago. When dinosaurs for the first time. For the first time they tired giant siblings for the first time, they differentiated and conquered the herbivorous niches of carnivores of omnivores in the whole planet. We were dedicating this in the last 10 years, with a group of colleagues, students and neighbors to explore the rocks of Patagon's curasic. And that leads me to one of the stories of the discoveries we were able to do in the last years. We found it four years ago, in Cerros like this, walking a lot of heat afternoon. After walking all day, I mean returning to the camp. I was walking and I saw some meters, something that caught my attention, between the rocks on the floor. And I got closer, as I got closer, it was becoming clearly what it was. It was the train of a dinosaur. I approached, stood next to me, stood up, really. I asked myself what it was, and I knew it was, after studying years of bones, of anatomy, of dinosaurs, and I knew perfectly what the track of a carnivor dinosaur was. But really? I couldn't believe it, I knew it was one of those discoveries that happen very few times in life. Then, to warn the rest of the team. And after several celebrations, the next day we started the task of... To protect this rest to be able to extract it, after several days we were able to cover it with layers layers, as we do to transport it to the museum. And we started to take it low. But the expedition was over, we didn't count with the team, nor time, we needed to look like a big escape and we had to return to the museum. Until the next time given the winter came. It was a long year of waiting until we were able to organize the following expedition, we needed to open the escape and see if there was something else, it was only the channel we had found. Or there were more preserved rests. After that long year, the first day of the statition. We realized it was the complete skeleton of this dinosaur, this is something very rarely. In the dinosaurs' halls, it's a complete, preserved skeleton in a spectacular way in life positions. Clearly, the animal was dead, on a lake or on a lake and had already been covered by endless glass caps, preserving in an intact way its sketch. And there he begins excavation: reading, staying, cap, cap, those sediments that were shaking. It's a very exciting moment, it's not for the first time it's going back to the surface a animal that lived in that same place for 170 million years. Guys, he had to be dead, he had to be covered by sediments caps, that they kept accumulating, until gathering meters and meters of sediments caps, and that food was transforming into sedentary rocks. And in that same process, bones were transforming themselves into fossils for chemical reactions. Then all that package of sepultated rocks had to have climbed the surface by some fracture of the terrestrial cortex and some warming. From all this block. And there the rain and the wind had to start erosioning these layers, layer, until they started to discover. The layers I contained to this dinosaur, at the same time, the same summer we were walking in those hills, looking for. Those dinosaurs. So when you are aware of everything that has happened, you realize the only thing that is that moment, and it's very exciting. Going discovering juices is a new species completely unknown until the moment. It's a long job and it's done hours and hours under the Sun. The Patagonic wind that doesn't lose, and then we were able to carry. All this rest is protected by layers to the lab. In the lab and the museum, another stage is extremely long, where technicians, with infinite patience, are removing big or big. All the rocks that cover these dinosaurs' bones. And that's when we can see, for the first time, the complete skeleton and we can see this dinosaur we call Eva Elizáurus. Studying the anatomy of these rests, what we saw was that it was a relievable parent of the South hemisphere. And this discovery showed us that this family had been originated 100 million years before. What we thought: much before the South hemisphere and the North hemisphere separated themselves being divided by a big ocean, when all the continents were united in a great supercontinent. Now, not all the discoveries follow this trajectory, some discoveries really do them in the lab and we don't know what we have in our hands until we get there. For example, of some rocks like these that we carry to the museum, knowing that there are fossils, but without knowing exactly what we have inside and after nine months of work in the lab. We were able to discover the rest of a dinosaur that was contained in those rock blocks. The challenge was quite complete and told with a very well preserved meat and with some very strange teeth. Dents in a form of hand, and that's why this dinosaur is called "man and Dance." Now, this dinosaur is very particular, in addition, for something very special, which is one of the smallest dinosaurs in the world, what I have here is a replication of the rain of this dinosaur, it's a very small dinosaur, one of the small dinosaurs in the end of the tail. And this mini dinosaur was not so surprising because if you see it in the South Africa map, in rocks of the same North hemisphere, studying its rest, we could see that their closest relatives had been found in their Africa and Patagonia, they were very close to this time of Pangea. It's still not formed of the Atlantic Ocean that separates these two continents today. But we had a case again. In other words, restricted animals, only from the hemisphere and they didn't have anything to do with the North hemisphere. We started to find other cases that were adjusted to this pattern. And this led us to study with colleagues who work in other animals that live in this time, in fossil plants that have been found in this region, and also colleagues who study rocks, which are very important because they inform us about the environments of this time. Speaking of climate models, what we saw is that at this moment of Pangea, where all the continents were united, that configuration had given a very particular climate dynamic that posted the existence of a great desert in the equatorial area of the supercontinent. And it's clear that all this fauna we were finding was the south of this big 14th century. It was a great success what was isolated to this fauna, making it evolve in an independent and completely separated way from the fauna of the northern hemisphere, it was the lack of water, what had isolated these fauna, it wasn't a desert full of water. Thank you very much. And when we think about dinosaurs... And we find fascinating things that have in their anatomy, we are really fascinating organisms. They have challenged the limits of the body size in the history of life. They have diversified and conquered all the terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. But the most important thing is that. It's that they take us to understand chapters like these in the history of the planet. And we, paleontologists, dedicate a great part of our lives. Learn to read these stories. Stories that are written in the rocks that formulated for millions of years in our planet, attracting each time to the animals and plants that lived in the past while they were forming. The Earth is a big book. With a huge amount of pages written throughout 4 500 million years. Life occupies a prepondering place in this story in the last 3800 million years. That in millions of pages still by reading this book, and if we really want to know our planet, their ecosystems, the problems we're seeing in today? It's fundamental to know your story. Because knowing the past. It's key to understand the present. "Yes." (Applause) It's also key to design a future, thanks (Music) (Cheers) (Applause) (Applause) Like many of us, when I was a kid, I wanted to have superpowers. anticipating what they would later read so many books and see so many movies. I dreamed of competing. And contain magical powers to build things. I dreamed of defending small villages of terrible invasors. Well, time is... It's not a reality bathroom. It loses subtle and you don't have the magic barite of thesearry potatoes. You see empire without empty what you want to leave. And you don't have the passion of patterns to defend them. But something about that child's vocation? It was in me and almost without realizing it. I dedicated myself to looking. And to try to understand how these superpowers work. They are not my imagination. but in the real world. Today I want to share with you six ideas to develop one of the main superpowers. Maybe the most important thing in this situation is to live. What is the superpower of thinking better? Obviously, there are many more superpowers. And many more tools to think better. But today I want to focus on which I think are less known. Those I'm going to tell you are my ideas, or I learned from others. And this is perhaps the main idea of all ideas, something like the zero idea of what I'm going to tell you. That we are able to learn. And that our ability to think is not given nor is it fixed. But it can be developed. Putting our mind with powerful and practicing ideas. So we went, I tell you six ideas I learned from others to think better. The first one: imagine they enter a gym. Look that those in the floor, those goals, bicycles, daughters, they go to the bar, they have a box with milk with three meters of Manteque and you're comfortable. It doesn't work like that, right? Our body doesn't improve with this. Well, compensating happens the same. It doesn't count being able to think. What counts is to think. We have to practice, think. They develop the habit of thinking and give time to think. Intelligence is not something that has or doesn't have. It's something we use or we don't use. The second one. Do you see the saying? Those who only see a martillo see all the problems as a keyboard. But if we have to take a tournament, it doesn't serve a mattress. Not to realize their keyboard. If we have a tournament, we need a disturbing. And if we need to cut something, we need a bear. To have a box of tools with more tools allows us to do more things, to solve more problems. And tools are called mental models. If we only have a mental model, we will think of all the problems with that model. As if we were trying to get a 2,000 with a noise. If we have many mental models, our mind is much more powerful. But where do these mental models find? Well, they find themselves in different disciplines, in different places, without different times. For example, there are interesting mental models in physics, biology, engineering, psychology. And there are also different mental models in Japan, Tanzania and Argentina. In mental models, in the old Egypt, 3,000 years ago before Christ. In the Middle Ages and in our time. To think better, we have to expand the box of tools in our heads. "No." All the problems will seem uncled. It's the third. Little by little I was in the club and at the table of the side, a man told his friends. He had told him about all his son's soccer teacher. Go ahead of his son and his classmates. For a mistake, the teacher had committed. The man was right in everything his friends told him, because he had told him to the teacher. He didn't realize it. What? What? What? In other words, this. I was creating a much greater evil. In Switzerland. I was leaving it as a ton in front of his friends. And I was unleasant to the teacher. In front of all the children who had to learn from him. Many times we don't realize it. To be focused on earning a scale. It makes us have success in that scale. And without knowing it, we do things that make us lose in another most important scale. To have a discussion and lose a friendship, for example. A silver and freedom, or with freedom and losing love. When we act, we think what is the impact we are going to do? And what is the most important scale in which we have to think like acting? And the fourth? The principle taught us that essentials are invisible to the eyes. It's through the eyes of the senses where we generate our impression. And the impression generates emotions. And emotions make us act. For example, in the pandemic, many Chinese situations arrived. But those acts didn't generate impressions. They generated emotions and they did not act. When they started to get there. Italian images, a country that we feel more family and similar to China. These simple expressions were emotion, fear. And the fear of generating action, that we are all now watched preventively what is very good. We were lucky that fear gave us time. Because someone has seemed to us before. But many times it's important to act when we still don't see and feel. The practice of anticipating is what distinguishes us from modern civilization of prehistoric. "Casar is something, do you have hunger?" Have you got married? You have an immediate reward, you eat what you get married. But cultivating is very different: it makes the effort now for something that will take advantage of for six months or a year. This is the pillar of almost everything we have. But preventing us generate applause. Because you're avoiding something. That nobody is a benicient. But except lives. We develop our ability to act before feeling. In other words, developing our ability to anticipate is one of the main skills of thinking well. Let's think a minute. What do we have to anticipate? Now... That we still feel, we live. In China? We all evaluate things according to our expectations. If something bad lasts three months and we think it would last six months. We are happy. If something bad lasts three months and we think it's going to last one month, we're sad. It's the same time, it's three months, but we live them completely different. If we program to run 10 kilometers, for example. In kilometers, we are exhausted. If we program to run 20. Nine kilometers are unbearable. We make a story of resilience, but the key of resilience is to manage well the expectations. The sex is worthwhile. Have you ever met a well-known place? You're walking through a chicken in the middle of the swimming pool. A high school company that wouldn't do 15 years ago. You can't create an unlikely chance to find yourself in that place. That's true, finding that classmate, in that place, is something totally unlikely. But, as we know so many people... It's very likely to find someone in a very unlikely place. In fact, it happens all the time. Well, with the rest of the same life, are there so many unlikely things? It's very likely that something happens very unlikely to us. The problem is that our mind makes us think that the improbable is impossible and it's not. It says the saying that prognoses say a lot about the prognosis and little of the future. We don't know what will happen. Neither now, my field with more formal times. We have to learn to live with uncertainty. And it was better the intelligent way to live with the uncertainty. To always leave many open doors. Not to think only about the most likely and search for ways to take care of ourselves when it is possible, even if they are very likely. And if someone ever asks you? Why do you always have cars with the stick of "hash full"? Contestal. Because once you find yourself in a village on the other side of the world. With a high school classmate who didn't see those 15 years ago. I told you at the beginning that I wanted to do with this talk. Surely the most important thing is to develop our ability to learn. And learning has to do with being accepted. To the facts of ideas that make us change in a way of thinking. And people with whom to cultivate these ideas. To be able of people who enrich our way of thinking. It's not about convincing others, it's about changing our own ideas. A 40-year-old interview, the interview Domis is a question. And when Borges replied: The interviewer told me, "This same you answered to me." That same question four years ago. Borfies, I don't know what I've done. He looked at him. And he said: If I ask for excuses, I haven't had a lot of time to think about this subject for these four years. Let's take advantage of this limit moment that we have to live. To be made of new ideas. From the new ideas that are emerging and being always open to change our way of thinking. Thank you (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Women are irrational beings. Always given to the emotional disorder, that's why they need the custodian of a man, which is the rational of the family. At the beginning of their lives, they will be contained by a father and if they learn well, they will achieve a good husband when they will have to take care of. This phrase was in the introduction of a manual for the education of girls and young girls about marriage. That circulated in the whole planet, in different translations, is the decade of 1930. But the idea, in itself, has 5,000 years of existence in the whole planet, in all cultures, in all times. In 1915 no country in the world could vote women. In 2015, that is, in 100 years later, 65 countries are governed by women. In 1910 (Applause) In 1910 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize. (Applause) But the academic science academic, and the first woman in France, who entered the Science Academy, was in 1979: 36 years ago. Many of you here have already finished the primary. The University of Harvard has a very prestigious business school that has 1965 to 50 years ago, left a woman to be a master's degree. Hale University admired women in 1972. The Prince University recently in 1974, and we could continue and follow. This was the idea that women only serve to create children and help their husband. It's a rational series, which is hystéric. It was a truth made a century, they believed it in the same women, there were 1800 million people in the world at that moment. And almost all, leaving 5,000, maybe, they believed this idea. It was a true fact. Why did the world change so much in a century, in addition, in the last 50 years, when it changed? Because we are living the most amazing transformation in the history of human culture, we are changing a conceptual paradigm to another conceptual paradigm, it's a revolution that all political revolutions we've lived in, the idea that truth is true. The idea that truth is a lie, there are no facts, there are only interpretations. Human beings don't have a direct relationship with the world, we relate to the world through language. In other words, we don't see the world, we see our idea of the world. 2500 years ago, Pindaro already said this in a poem. Now neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying this, we can see the world that our mind allows us to see, not any world, not the goal world. There's a huge discussion at this moment about whether the world exists outside, we will be able to understand it. When you say that there is no fact, that there are interpretations, many people believe that interpretation is a kind of personal delirium. That interpretation is something subjective, interpretations are strong social arguments, it's the base of ideas, we don't have any human idea that hasn't emerged from an interpretative mark. What is an interpretative mark, what day is it? 24th September. Does anyone doubt it? What day do you stop? (Laughter) Well, we convinced it's on September 24th, because we're all here, we agree with the Gregorian calendar, but if we were in the Chinese calendar, or more than 500. On September 24th, we wouldn't have any sense, every thing we say, every thing we think: That we are part of a very arduous social construction that we have automatized and naturalized, places live without a calendar. Audience: Yes. My dog, Chiap, Alkeador, and who is very lonely at home. No, making some misfortune. I didn't know the time, I knew what I had now returned. It doesn't look at the clock. If human beings didn't have these conceptual boats, would we have a relationship with the world? That it would be perhaps a little more stimulus answer, but surely the world we would live wouldn't make any sense. All idea is a daughter of a time, not of a brilliant mind, they have taught us that Newton was sitting below a tree. He looked at me to fall in a blanket, wrote the law of gravity: "What a genius!" But it's not like ideas arise, ideas arise at the time. If Darwin would have lived in the 14th century and being the same genius that it was, he would never have been able to develop the theory of evolution. They had lacked the trips I made, to know the animals I saw, all those who had accumulated in the British museum, the fossils, etc. Besides... To discuss the research that accumulated throughout 500 years for the diffusion of books and the print, in the 14th century, didn't even exist the print. It doesn't matter how great it can be a man if it doesn't have the context, it can't think of an idea. The wise, the geniuses are those able to synthesize an idea, but the time is the one that generates it. The theory of evolution could only be born in the 19th century, or has never been born. But he was born in the 19th century. The same happens with the theory of relativity, the same thing happens with quantum mechanics, and the same thing we see in scientific movements, in technological innovation, that are increasingly more developed thanks to this new paradigm that the facts only exist in interpretations, when we go to the economic and social field, the revolutionary change. As we have seen, for thousands of years women were the ones who took care of the house and raised the children. And, however, in less than 100 years, countries governed half of the scientists today in the world are women, half of the university teachers are women, look at all the creative energy that was lost in humanity to think in the way women didn't serve for anything more than to clean panels. How many remedies, how much intelligence, how much creativity ... In other words, errones ideas are monsters. There is an idea we can do it. To follow because it was created a century and a half and that example to study this process, which is the creation of homosexuality. Until 1860, there were no homosexuals in the world. You'll say, "But how, the Greeks and Romans, and the Pingüinos, and all those things, and yes, the relationships between people of the same sex, both men and women, or any other transgenere that occur to you to imagine today, always exist in every culture, in all times." They are even documented in many species of animals outside of humans. But I had never thought that sexuality of a person, anomal, as they called it at that moment, determined how a person was totally, sexual identity. It wasn't innocent, it was the moment of the generation of A. Moral Victorian, who was one of the great forms of social control during a century and a peak. The strongest thing is that there is, because the same thing that turns into the catholic Church sex, when it proves us something we want to do, there are no turbies. (Laughter) You do it with guilt, that is, you're going to do it, but it's going to give you guilt, it's not true, it's a great social control... (Applause) You don't give the woman of your fellow man. (Laughter) Or the man of your fellow man, right? It will give you guilt, it will give you guilt, and even if it gives you guilt, you do it, and then that's a form of terrible social control because it dominates us, probably, on the one hand, you know we can't leave, it's as if they were given us to eat. We can't stop eating, that's why we're all fat. Through the prohibition of homosexuality, of censorship, there was a waste bathroom where everything that was bad in the society of the sexual point of view was put there. The homosexuals, during a century, were terribly pursued in the whole world, didn't have the right to talk, nor the right to defend themselves, the same as women before, or that the blacks that neuroscience went from slavery, and we talked about when they were slaves. It also changed the situation of homosexuals, it also changed the situation of blacks, the situation of Jews, none of the situations today is ideal. But we all live much better, more free, and in a much more tolerant environment that makes a century. It's been 50 years ago, 20 years ago, homosexuals in Argentina didn't only have the right to marriage, but we didn't have the right to donate blood, it's just about to get up now, and many parts of the world are still condemned to be frightened. But in many parts of the world today, they are completely legal: this was possible, because this paradigm change allows the fight of gay, Jewish, black, etc., all the depressed, take their identity, respect and then make others understand that they are also human beings who have full rights. To respect me as a Jewish, I have to be just a Jewish. (Laughter) To respect me as a woman, I have to be just a woman, like a black man, only black, and the same thing is gay. And if you win the women, the Jews, the blacks, the white, we are all complete, complex people, contradictories, that maybe I don't have to win, what am I doing, but, however, we have to accept that? Identity is a prison, maybe the most terrible, the prison. Thank you very much (Applause) 50 years ago? Look how old I am, I was a homosexual child. I didn't know what a homosexual child was, I didn't know the homosexual word, and they didn't tell me like that, my colleagues told me: "I agree, I put you, we'll screw you up." (Laughter) I didn't even know what it was, nor gordopusto, nor homosexual, nor anything, and at the same time I knew that it caused rejection, that it was something I had in me, that I didn't know it was. I went back home, from school, and I saw that my father, who loved me, looked at me. And I started to feel what would I have done so that it come out like that. What was it like that? I had to learn what to be like that, I had to learn to be homosexual. I had to become homosexual, I had to insist on being homosexual. To assume the identity there was in the positive side. I learned to make myself respect, I learned, Jewish here, women here, blacks too, have learned the same, that today I had to know 10 times more than the others, do everything better than the others, not so they wouldn't replace me. I had to make a lot of effort and I learned a lot. But at the same time, I got a terrible prison that was about 24 hours. I stopped being a person. And I'm a person, like any other person in the world, I'm against victory, I'm complete, I'm complex. It took me 50 years to convince the rest of my acquaintances, public interventions, to convince others that we are sexual, we are people and we are human beings. And it took me 50 years to learn. That I'm also a person who says I'm complete, complex, contradictory, that I don't have to be gay at 24 hours, that we have to escape from identity. 20 or 30 years ago this idea I had. There are the facts that arise to understand that there are no facts. (Laughter) (Applause) There are contradictions and babies, because in fact, we are contradictory, there are facts that there are interpretations, that means that they put me in a jaula, they put me in a place, I had to assume that giving me there to defend myself, and when we only have a head doesn't serve us. I left that body, left the prison, and I left my prison, it was so wonderful. Do you think jail is? (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Have you ever told me that there is a list of things we need to survive, called the basics channel? What's the idea of living constantly with this channel, and if I had the things we need to survive: Mexico, San Pedro, our community, does it contain the things we need to survive? But exploring is something difficult, terrifying, every moment, person and place are completely different, the constant movement leads us to extraordinary situations, to adapt is a moment, long or small time, full of confusion, where a storm and everything you know disappears. When everything you did is paid for the voices of someone else, you had a microphone, that duplicates the intensity of your ideas and, besides, all those ghosts that obstaclesize it. But once you say it, once you make your words, you get a avalanche of ideas that come towards you all speed. Each of these ideas looks like a bomb that tries to exterminate, but some of these ideas are rain, and you can choose, open your paraguas and cover them, or do one side and in part with each one of them. Every moment, it's a combination of energy, to decide to get out, run or run, but learning to do this movement is something complicated, learning to damage your own movement, a class isn't wrong. With a dance lesson, I learned to modulate the intensity that needs every moment, movements that take moments, like a chain, moments in which you don't stop laughing, movements I believe them, and that even if life builds music, the movements need each moment. Moments. That they keep words, poems, stories, stories and memories, in a notebook, memories that probably won't be a work of art, but they will allow you to review the exact way those stars saw. In the formula you saw that face, when you spoke about what you loved the most, the mouse raises your heart, or how do you break when you talk, that voice? That voice that you so much know, that you know you're probably looking for something you lose, that voice, your best friend, will always be there. It will be the first to defend yourself, the first part of the puzzle to jump that sea of possibilities, and at the same time, the first is in that orilla list to jump for you when you need it. That person is your best friend. A microphone, a paraguas, a library, a dance class and a better friend, without that, if it's a nickname, I can't survive. (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) Later, the opportunity is to release, I'm sure... (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) Nothing to do, I can't continue a stable job, I can't progress in the way I would like to. And there, a person always appears for what they will have been in years. Keep calm and with a bread, you remember your experience, if you don't sell the net. Do you remember that all the time spent was better? Chip! Is this really like that? Or maybe we don't know how to take advantage of what reality has to offer us. To think about this. Unfortunately, I remember my friends of all life, and Juancho, Franco and Manuel. These photos that are seeing there. It's 2009 when I live in secondary school. What can I tell you about my friends? That I really want them to be like my brothers. And there are three superable people. That, as I didn't count on the necessary resources to stay like the power for the power I liked. They stayed at each city. And go to surprise, to the day of today, you can't get a job that allows you to get closer to fulfill your dreams. As for me, I want to be in this picture. The lack of opportunities is also present, my biologists, who are workers, made an effort on humans so that I could study what I liked. Because I knew that I didn't even know that if I stayed here in the city. I could study something, but probably the future as a person would be short of opportunities. Have you ever wondered why these things happen? Children have been among one. We are in the middle of this phenomenon we know as globalization. In which successes and advances go with a speed that surprise us all. And above the borders and the barriers that fit between people. And in this context? Cities to make more and more important cities. Let's go to the center, it's our home, and we create them and recreate them to each step of our existence. It is estimated that in 2050. A 68% of the world's population will live in a city. Because if that number doesn't sound, it would be almost 7 out of 10 people in the whole world. Seven out of ten. If each of the more people choose to live in cities... And he says: "And where do we have the greatest chance to cry?" (Laughter) What do you explain then that while the city arises appear to stay in time, other progress, vibrant, everyone wants to visit them and everyone wants to live in them? I'm going to tell you a key word that I want you to keep here when you get out of that door to return home. This is strategy. If we want globalization to help us to find more opportunities to people, we need to go strategically to the world. Part of my concern as a professional future in the field of International Relations, it happens precisely for this. To connect cities? With the opportunities that the world has to offer us. Not in an indiscriminated way, but in our strength, our potentialities. And trying to decrease the impact the world can have on our most vulnerable characteristics. Now you'll tell me, "How do you see all this so beautiful that I'm telling you in real life?" Through concrete projects. That improves the quality of life of the population and avoid migration to other places, it's like a better future. Once again, inevitably, I remember my friends. This is a photo a few months ago, and so you can write a couple of things to start. We add a fifth friend, friend Field, the group, do you know what it is? The drink of alcohol. Secondly, we can also say that it is given a kind of universal relationship in proportional. As it was improving the quality of the strengths of the phones. (Laughter) Some have a couple of threads, and others have to be happy, but what we were going to improve. Do you know what we share today beyond the deep time we have the students with us? The lack of opportunities. The white man, for example, who is also right in this picture. Audience: Oh! It was a national champion of geography loneliness in 2002. A national champion. But today, although it's left to dedicate to studying a school teacher, it doesn't have time, because it has to be from Monday to Monday working to be able to live. After these fourths, it's the one who's left below, who just goes to his audience. I wanted to study something related to the field of defense to be able to extract in one of the security for the country. I mean, as I didn't count with that possibility here, from then on, changing the career without finding what is inside the passion. And I can't get a job that allows seven economical dependencies. The last one is Manuel, who is a genius of illustration, but they don't know the geniuses, they give them anything. But they tell it: every day, working in their local that built from nothing itself. Go to college to study programming. And you can't develop your potential and keep learning what you like, because you can't find necessary tools for lack of presupport to your diversity. Time studies programming and it doesn't have the necessary programs in the computer to study. And the worst of all this I'm telling you. "What? What?" We, as young people, don't have it. Nothing that makes us less than the rest of the world, absolutely nothing. Do you know? Recently, I had the huge fortune of being elected between a group of 8 young children at a World Cup to participate in a week in New Delhi, the capital of India. I traveled to the representation of Argentina, I was the only Argentine in that event. (Audience) Yes! Besides saying that it was an incredible experience, that is, my head came back. I learned a lot. But if there are two things I would like to share with you, they are following. 1:1pm. Me: "One." There are millions and I will never be able to say it with enough lenses so that you can understand it, but there are millions of opportunities outside. For all tastes and for all colors. (Laughter) But there are discourse found, they don't come alone. In one of the two. But not less important. Our human resources, as Argentinians, are brilliant, we don't have one to guide young people to be obvious, nor to the Chinese, nor to anyone. Do you know what differentiates them that we don't have? Because they have a state that is present to go out to the world and bring them opportunities to them to develop them. Another time we want my cities, we leave strategically in the world. Remember? When I arrived for the first time in Rosario, that I could stop studying. With three days to fulfill 18 years. I was very scared, with a lot of fear. This can never tell you in public. Because it's very difficult, but all around me know for everything I had to happen. It's very difficult for your city. What to study? It's like leaving a piece of your heart, until today I feel like that, six years went by. To do this, I don't have to go to the voice. Who are the friends? And nobody you know? To give them wings to the city they had to do, it's necessary to give them tools to our youths so they stay in their cities and grow from there. And with a strategy we can do it. [A.DE.] Let's go. Imagine the brilliant who would have been strange if I would have been able to dedicate myself to this goal of geography. How much? If today they had one of the strength of security in our country. Because for us not to be so far, Emanuel, if he had the necessary programs to be able to continue believing what he likes. "Ah, yes?" "Thank you." "Thank you." You've already lacked opportunities. It's not true. Thank you. All of this. Because, I'm telling you, it doesn't seem enough argument and it wants a more example. Stop! Let's see, this one. It's the tattoo that tells me when, finally, I was able to overcome the deep depression of mine in which I fell to have a footprint in my city. Twenty of suicide... In numeral, psychological sequels... I liked it all. A lot, a lot of supermarket. If we want these things to stop passing, we have to go out strategically. Please, we don't take a final point to our cities. Thank you very much (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I'm a surgeon. Since always, surgeons... We think that to have more work we have to look for more reasons to operate more patients. In my last 10 years? My research ... In my case, in the zoo, the reasons were based on looking for. To operate less and less to patients. This can be done in several ways, we do it, for example, looking for genes. To detect more early diseases, like cancer, and so you don't have to operate them. We can help tissues to repair. For themselves. We do this with biological platforms that are like maps we read to the tissue so that they use their own capacity using their own ability to regenerate. To restore yourself after a damage. And finally, with new technologies... We can, for example, with an endoscope, make procedures. And to preserve organs where before, we had to operate and take them out. Robotics are giving us a lot of tools. To facilitate these tasks. What seemed science fiction before today is almost daily, it's hallucinating. To challenge my own paradigms of having more and more patients to operate gave me many satisfactions. Do you like me? And even a lot of patients who avoided having to make a surgery. With all this I told you, I realized that developing methods, increasingly invasive fears. I have more and more work. (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I would like to share a reflection about what a collective culture can mean, at a moment like this, in which the world is living a pandemic. Thank you. I'm not a doctor. My mother is Japanese and I think that certain behaviors and answers of the Japanese society can also help us when facing a crisis like this, literary, sociological and anthropological, of the Japanese culture, have had contact with issues. It's worth asking us a first question. Why Japan was he able to avoid the greatest impact of the contage if in January he got the first case, being so close to the neighbour? I had almost 130 million in very reduced space. Having the third age's biggest populations in the world, being the second country with more smoke for many inhabitants. Why, in Japan, the infection of this virus hasn't had an exponential growth? And the certificate, but a linear progress. Until now. (Laughter) We know that this new coronavirus is very contagious. In these demographic data, Japan shows us a cocktail that would allow a great propagation of the disease, basically. Many people, in little place. And a room of that people with more than 65. What happens then? Japanese is a society that responds in an organic and humid way before any event that compromises it. Japanese went through wars, Tifones, tsunami. Japan receives 1500 earthquakes per year. 1,000 temblors per day. Generation between generation has had to overcome natural disasters, co-generated by man. This is what we can think of something that likes the Argentines a lot: football teams like an example. What football team will have better performance before a critical moment? The team that trains every day has infrastructure in which each one knows what to do. (Laughter) Or the team that never trained. It doesn't have infrastructure. And it has to come out to improvise. The directives of social distancing, hygiene, and individual behavior are associated with their own house. The Japanese population hasn't established for hundreds of years, doesn't need to say, it doesn't embrace. Not giving beers, because they don't do it, they greet with a reverence. Daring distance is a gesture of respect, and most workers in public places use a lot. It's not necessary to recommend to get out of shoes, to enter the house, because it's already used. So we don't have to indicate "non't be harmful about another person." Because this is a usual protocol between Japanese. In fact, studies of years show that more than 50% of Japanese will use board to feel reflected. Not to protect yourself, but to protect others. Here's the fundamental message of a collective culture, the good of the whole. It's more important than the good of one part. In Japan, to illustrate this, I would like to close with an experience that made two Western teachers in a school in Japan. And surely you will know the game of the chairs, and you will get out of one, you put music, chairs in a circle, a less than the number of participants. In each round. And the kids, instead of pushing themselves to drink a chair, stayed all, made this experience in Japan. Seeing the place to a classmate. Because embarrassment, win one when another suffers. The word "how" expresses this way of being, it's about having trust that the other will take care of me, in resonance, consent that we realize when we take care of others. In the example of children, but we can already see how a collective society works. Because each invisible contributes to the good of everyone. (Applause)
